Inflation in Europe has led to food
The accelerated inflation in the euro area is mainly due to an unsustainable increase in food prices.
The price growth in the 13 euro area countries was expected to increase by 2.6 per cent in October, the annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, announced by the Luxembourg statistical office of the Union.
The official ruling suggested that only 3 per cent of them were sent to Bloomberg.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian Emissions Bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the basic rate by reducing the rising prices of raw materials and reducing unemployment resulting from inflation.
The ECB would like to maintain the rate of inflation below two per cent, in addition to their proximity.
According to one of the analysts, the ECB is in an absurd situation: inflation must be "ordered", so that it will no longer have to do anything about it.
In Germany, the November inflation rate is 3.3 per cent of the fifteen-year record; in Spain, the figure rose from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
The euro area inflation was rising because of the price of food and energy prices rising.
The term prices of wheat rose by 88 per cent, as well as the price of barley reached the highest value since 1973.
Similarly, more than one oil and milk products had to be paid in 2007.
The price of roses on the world markets this year rose by 52 per cent and in the past month, one barrel of black gold has become almost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation is starting in 2008 from 2.1 per cent per cent of the year to 2.5, but in 2009 it has already reached 1.9.
According to the analysis, the 12-month inflation rate will remain approximately 3 per cent in the following 3-4 months, while its average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to double its interest rates during 2008.
Gallup sees the government crisis
The area of the Fidesz strike after the deceleration to the beginning of December has grown significantly, and has now been available to the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of the Gallup Institute socialists it is so low - 13 per cent of the support has never been planned.
In the case of certain voters, the difference - due to the greater commitment of the opposition voters - would represent more than two-thirds (71 percent) of the support for the sale of the five-year SME support.
MDF and SZDSZ are according to a study under the heading for entry into Parliament: their support for the whole population is 2%.
Among certain party voters, there is a percentage more than one percentage of the awardors of both camps.
The public's view of the economy has also fallen because of the past minimum - there has never been a measure of those who consider the economic situation of the country to be so bad - 41 per cent, while, according to other 46 per cent, the situation is quite bad.
Family values will change their material situation after years and years of more promising views now more pessimistic.
With regard to the next year, most of the population is listed with a further deterioration and only ten improvements.
In December 71% of the respondents were asked, which is most of all of the Gallup Institute's research that the prime minister is doing his job worse than good.
Ferenci Gyurcsanay believes or strongly believes 13 percent of the respondents, while Victor Orbán is 38 percent of the recipients.
The Prime Minister doesn't believe 54 per cent, the President of Fidesz' strike 27 per cent.
One of the indicators of political developments is how much the public is supposed to be able to deal with tension with the prime minister without changing governments.
While the government and the prime minister were considered by 35 per cent to be in demand after the late summers, this share was already only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) looked at the solution only in creating new elections.
In the interest of the referendum, 60 per cent of the respondents responded to a question concerning their appropriate participation in the referendum and 20 per cent reported that it was likely to come.
For comparison, "the parliamentary elections organised this week" would certainly only be attended by 55 per cent and another 15 per cent would consider their participation likely. The success of the referendum would be inevitable on the basis of current ideas.
The school said not 74, 79 doctor fees and 84 per cent hospital stays.
If we look at the same proportions only in the area of people who are definitely promising their participation, then the introduction of school fees, medical fees and hospital stays would be 81, 84 and 89 per cent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost five times Tesco.
The hypermarkets in the Bulgarian trade triangle maintained a low, average 16 percent increase in prices with the difference that this year did not lead to an increase in GDP.
The Danish daily economy
The average annual consumption of Napi Gazdazás in the Bulgarian business year increased by 16 per cent, while in all hypermarkets, there was an increase of nine times more than a thousand forints.
Since the prices in supermarkets have already fallen in December, as a percentage of the previous high base has not been so dramatic.
However, it is certainly not pleasing for consumers to buy what they could buy at a price of less than nine thousand Forints does not now amount to ten thousand.
The necessary cost of the daily economy in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints of at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10,573 Forints.
(In 2003 the consumption of 6,800 Forints was low.)
The price of Unica and live fish remained so low, but also greatly influenced the harshness of the breasts, breasts and breasts as well.
The prices of bread and milk correspond to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although we found a kilogram of bread in Auchan and for 139 Forints.
The competition did not go with the price of the product under 200 Forints.
In the same way, it was surprising that the price of the Coca Coly double was below 200 Forint in the neck, so the product was only 257 Forints.
This year, however, he took Napi Gazdasz Auchan as the most expensive, while Cora as the youngest.
According to our estimates, the prices of the Napi Gazdazáz in the consumer basket rose by 15 percent, while Tesco and Auchan were about 18 percent.
In comparison, the lowest and lowest annual consumption levels of the cow were 12 per cent, while growth between the lowest and the highest annual rate was 21 per cent.
In Forintich, there was an increase of 1,480.
The average increase in the price of wool was 1,206 Forints with the effect that the price of wool was affected by the increase in VAT.
In view of the fact that the trade process was broken down, trade houses were obviously unable to determine how large price fluctuations were to be established in individual products, as they could not predict the impact of price changes on consumption.
(If the trader plans the speed of the product concerned wrong, the price increase may result in significant profits.)
Due to the rise in the price of the consumer basket, Napi Gazdasz showed that the price of the most expensive basket was 1,720 Forints in 2006, while the lowest price difference was 844 Forints.
This year there was no such national difference, the cheapest cost was now 1,630 Forints more than the wool and also the lowest rate of 1,284 Forints.
In comparison with the two summer seasons, the most catastrophic price growth was observed, with daily consumption in hypermarkets increased by more than 30 per cent for less than 20 months.
(In addition, however, it does not fully confirm the data of the Central Statistical Authority: it intended, in the case of several basic food, to increase prices by more than 30 per cent over 12 months.
In addition to bone, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, however, according to the consumption rate of the Daily Economy, this seems impossible, as the price of the product, quite expensive already in the last year, showed a rise of almost 10 per cent on the basis and in the worst case of the price increase.
In addition, the supply of milk is more than the supply of eggs, and the price increases have also been caused by a drastic increase in international networks.
Hypermarkets don't complain about the commercial gold triangle, they're still referring to a good year.
According to our experience, most customers in the three visited shops are no longer interested in prices.
They're buying all the money, they're taking sustainable food for payments.
In the middle of the afternoon, in all three supermarkets, long fronts were created in the afternoon, as the number of visitors increased.
As far as we know, abroad, the business is lower, many international netizens argue with the research firm that the markets remain for their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, it's exposed to disinfectants.
More than a thousand cases of infection have been recorded in hospitals during the year, especially due to the inappropriate use of antibiotics.
Hygiene conditions of the hospital, bed filling, overload of the personnel of the arrest warrant do not help, says the National Epidemiological Center.
In many places it is also exposed to disinfectants.
Recently, the traumatological section of the Holy Jana hospital was diagnosed with an MRSA infection.
Bacteria resistant to antibiotics have been detected in men who got into the hospital after serious transport accidents.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same place at the beginning of the year.
The patient who was injured during a serious car accident was released home, but soon thereafter he had to return with the MRSA infection and because of the bacteria in his body he had not yet had an important operation.
By 10 December the National System of Nesocomialis Survey was reported to have 1,094 patients infected with multi-resistant diseases caused by the disease, Karolina Böröcsov, the primary member of the National Epidemiological Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistance sources of disability were registered in patients with safety, not known to others.
Nearly two thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacilin with resistant gold staphylcoke.
Bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (SA) carries three thirds of people in the nose without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g., seizure, mandala, skin infection, infection) are well reactive to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are administered in excess or inappropriately, they are produced from bacteria that respond well to bacteria that are very slow against antibiotics and which are rapidly spread in non-compliant conditions.
In particular, in case of transient or persistent immunosuppression of the immune system in patients with a weak body, low body weight, or in patients in years, serious medical infections, such as early infection or blood clots, may occur.
According to the top physician of the Holy Jan’ s hospital, there is no special, similar infection in patients with daily practice.
"The infection must not be replaced with the epidemic, MRSA is not just there," Tibor Nyulasi declared, "where the presence of the source of the disease is not tested."
He's giving antibiotics.
"We isolate these patients, the healing staff heals them in rubber gloves and massages and we need antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients taking the patient to the hospital are tested to determine whether MRSA is present in their body, however, the infection cannot always be avoided.
The sample sample is not in mode
The large majority of MRSA infections caused by MRSA could be predicted, despite the current measurements and conditions in the home hospitals are not to prevent the occurrence and spread of multi-resistant sources of inference, says Caroline Börczov.
Since this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and nursing homes, patients treated should be monitored and the MRSA carriers should be isolated immediately.
The collection of microbiological samples is not yet in Hungarian hospitals.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance this investigation.
In most cases, it has been found that if the patient is suffering from an infectious MRSA infection, the epidemiological center marker said.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the proper treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine and there are also home guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
It is necessary to ensure that antibiotics are targeted, or microbiological studies should be conducted to limit the incidence of resistance to medicinal products, even if these patients are not available in all cases.
The microbiological samples have been found to be even more common in the basic, ambulatory treatment of patients, according to Karolina Börczov.
She's looking at the disinfectants.
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is spreading among patients most often through medical personnel.
Therefore, he plays a very important role in washing his hands and using gloves and masks, and there are serious deficiencies in the patients.
MRSA is transmitted to the pen infection and to the affected person, but in the conditions of home patients it is not always possible to isolate infected patients.
However, the rooms are often filled, the beds are often very close to each other, perhaps from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 metres away.
As Karolina Börczova noted, unfortunately, we can also encounter patients who are in an unstable material situation, looking at the disinfectants, the healers are few and many patients, with the chance of an infection still rising.
According to Karoliny Börczov, there is a need for protective measures, similar infections that may prove to be less or other spreads of the disease may be prevented.
Management program against MRSA
The treatment of the MRSA infection is a health insurance expense, and therefore it is a fight against it everywhere.
For example, in England, the government has signed the MRSA prevention programme, which is related to reducing its demand.
As it seems, the program is successful, according to the data published, the MRSA infection in England has shown a disturbing trend.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is responsible for preventing the occurrence of multi-resistance sources of disease (between MRSA and MRSA), respectively, of medical infections caused by these diseases, among its priorities.
Police captain who caused a fatal accident was not drunk
The official investigation in the case of police captain XXII, who caused the fatal accident, is complete.
It can be ruled that the police captain of the capital of Attila Morva, who died on Tuesday and who, inter alia, resigned from his duties, led under the influence of alcohol or opium, would inform the speaker of the Russian state representative of the capital of Attila Morva on Friday, after having completed the finding of the case.
The investigation confirmed the outcome of the initial investigation that it had already found that the former police captain had not committed any alcohol before sitting as a volunteer.
The current police director of the XXII police department. The train hit the train on Tuesday at the Laise Kossuth Street in XXII. The train was driven by his own personal car when the five-year-old man who entered before him was crossing the vehicle outside the marked crossing.
(The last mentioned fact that the walker has been passing away from the bear, in the latter case according to the rules of the road operation, is not a distressing situation, the driving away must also be given priority.)
After he was transferred to the hospital, the walker died.
As a result of this incident, the chief of police withdrew from the function and requested the transfer to service, according to the police report, because the case was so severe.
The investigation of the state representative of Budapest is carried out.
Attila Morva also mentioned that the former police captain had been working with the State agents conducting the investigation.
Other 400 million euros on infrastructure
The three credit frameworks agreement totalling EUR 400 million in support of school, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy in Budapest were signed on Friday in the Finance Minister, János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 the Hungarian budget for the financing of projects in the transport and the environment carried out by the Cohesion Fund, a framework of EUR 300 million, while the parties had already concluded a credit agreement of EUR 100 million, which is now signed on the use of existing EUR 200 million.
A credit agreement of EUR 150 million is also used to finance projects related to schools.
The EIB has approved for Hungary for these purposes totalling EUR 300 million, for the remaining EUR 150 million can be used later, with the extension of the credit agreement.
In the area of innovation, the parties signed a contract of 50 million euros, which is mainly used in the Debrecini University research project.
The meeting was also about a 4-metre track.
The parties agreed that, after Hungary agreed with the EU, the financing of the metrics would return to whether and how the original agreement should be amended.
According to Jánose Verese, this can be achieved in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has financed in Hungary since 1990 an amount of EUR 8.4 billion in total of 113 projects.
The term of the loans granted by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without a commitment is bound to EURIBOR.
Bulgaria is a real EU environment
The development of the Bulgarian market with real estate is overwhelming - the attention of the whole of Europe is turning towards a slightly forgotten Balkan country.
What, where and who are currently buying the most cheap, more quickly than the attractive EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-out European destination for real estate purchases is now safe in Bulgaria with its cheap luxury apartments and houses on the coast.
From the top are most in the districts of Bansko, Borvec, Pamproro and Vitoša, then on the sea coast, Albena, Gold sands, Sunset coast, old cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, and there are still more people looking for property around Kavarny and Balčik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, the interest of investors and the central part of the country - for example, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more interested people also buy around the left city of Russia.
The main city of Sofia is also a combination of leisure opportunities, business and office spaces that promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best way to change into one of the most attractive golf areas of Europe, and is thus facing the summer and winter season with the aim of the journey even in the next two years.
The forecasters are already buying in large, such as around the Bank.
According to analysts, buyers of property in Bulgaria are trying to change their life and lifestyle at the same time.
Most customers come from England, also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more often from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors here, in the Black Sea and in the forest regions there are traditionally many Russian customers.
Foreign buyer can be divided into three groups, says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People are buying either refurbished property at EUR 50-100 000 or accumulated old houses at € 5-15 000, which are then renovated.
They require good access and communication opportunities, important to them is the proximity of the city, the trades and the rules of the local physician.
The second category is chat (Bulharsk held in December among the first 10 German recreational goals).
A third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in hopes of a medium- or long-term horizon.
The sale of property in the main city is inevitable because the demand is still stronger.
In Bulgaria, the lowest actual prices in the European Union are still low, but in the last five years, 21 per cent have grown annually.
The increase in the price of property is significantly higher than the increase in wages.
Fodor and six per cent Hungarian
According to the information provided by the Minister of the Environment and Water Economy, Gabora Fodora will be meeting experts on Tuesday, and the International Conference on the Climate regime will continue to meet ministers after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world agree on the Bali Roadmap, which will solve the following efforts following the period of emission reduction by the Kyoto Protocol, which is valid until 2012.
At this point, there is a heated debate between developing and successful countries.
The United States also announced that they are now not able to calculate the exact figures, although they are committed to the agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 per cent by 2020 in view of the 1990 situation.
The next big issue of the conference is whether the developed country is also contributing to the provision of both material and technological assistance to the countries that are allocated to it.
The Agreement was also drawn up on grants for developing countries.
The relevant fund, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by the 16-member Governing Council, most likely within the framework of the World Environment Programme (GEF) at the UN - we can read in Piac and Profit magazines.
Six per cent of Hungary
The Minister for the Environment and Water Economy, Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to play a leading role in the efforts to ensure global climate protection and to help create a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent of the 1990 level by 2020, regardless of the success of the adoption of "the 2012 agreement", and is prepared to undertake up to 30 per cent reduction in the event that the other successful regions of the world will also be willing to accept responsibility and commitments corresponding to their potential.
The Fodor Group pointed out that the countries which joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had reached a reduction of 5.2 per cent, while the remaining 15 EU Member States committed to 8 per cent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent in the 1985-87 years, which is complete by our authority. - It is recalled in the press report of the Ministry of the Environment.
It is a lot about Bali, because for two years it is necessary to adopt an international agreement on long-term climate change policy, otherwise its entry into force would have been reduced with certainty by 2012. In this case, the commitment to the reduction of the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately require a new system of emission reduction, which, in its most recent report, has also shown the need for the UN Scientific Committee on Climate Change - IPCC, which is the responsibility of the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would lead to a delay in emission reductions and an inevitable increase in earth-wide average temperature of more than 2 degrees Celsius, which would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences, according to scientists.
British Army is implementing a YouTube set
The British military units publish on the server to share the video recordings from shares in Iraq and Afghanistan, which they themselves popularize.
First, YouTube liked the British Air Force (RAF): Special units operating in Afghanistan have been recording videos from action against Taliban since March 2006.
The recordings, equipped with a mini-tour camera attached to the attachment, are controlled by the air force commanders of the Kandahar war operations and then sent to London, where they are transferred to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
This form has already reached 139 recordings of British air forces and has already seen over 75,000 people on their "canal".
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in January 2007 as "defenceheadquatters" and publishes shares in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the international peace units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Nassation in Afghanistan
Air forces have published videos according to their original purpose for the assembly and by the Ministry of Defence, they are also good to inform the general public of the actual objective of the presence of the foreign army.
"The propaganda published in this form against traditional television shows is almost worthless," the BBC expert on defence issues Gordon Mackenzie said, "but it also needs to contain a certain political message, as the special form confirms the right of military actions, which the government has decided."
The Americans made the game
The army is concerned that despite carefully adjusted, censored recordings, the server also receives amateur videos, which captures the death of soldiers: in a little covert, "official" propaganda films, the officials are talking about losses, yet there is no blood like fighting.
A lot of videos from the army in Iraq and Afghanistan have recently been received on the Internet, and the British army has still come to them.
The Americans perform a set of different ways - using shooting games called America's Army, which is free to download and in which the player can get the most faithful simulation directly into the soldiers' skin.
In the ministry they will be Christmas with tomboys and pancakes
The Ministry of Labour of Monika Lamperth is obviously not sentimental: the place of dinner will provide its staff with a final working meeting, which will end with Easter and Coffee with 2007.
Some ministries will celebrate with live music, while officials will be exposed to the nightly atmosphere of tombolism and excitement.
Tonight, summer atmosphere, concerts and Swedish table - so it's powerful.
They're also preparing for Christmas.
This year's prime minister's summer celebration will be organised by the Ministry of Defence, but it does not expect its employees to attend.
The Christmas orphans will receive gifts from children of fallen soldiers, who will welcome family members of soldiers who are currently serving in foreign missions, but also arrange receptions for journalists.
The resort is spending 25 million to the atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFU) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) shall issue a copy of the box to other resorts.
The GKM is located in the centre of Yvö Háza, with a total of 4,320,000 Forints and of the six hundred employees of the ministry are expected to have approximately three hundred guests.
The resort will be held for its celebration of Christmas traditions, but it will also come at various exhibitions and will also be released tomola.
The NFU stayed 4,700,000 Forints in the middle of the building of the State Justice Council (OIT) - on the program were concerts and dinners.
I'm looking for a living room with a million Forints, the rest was invested in more than four of them invited.
One section of the NFU seems to be invited to another evening celebration: here it arranges a tendering company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG) from the Union money.
To that end, they found the building of the Virgin House.
MAG a. s. did not confirm this information as we were unable to arrest the relevant person.
The suit doesn't need
The building of the OIT not only hosted the NFU, but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, which replaced Vánoc on December 7th St. Lucia.
However, the ILO did not want money from him to use his salts.
Five hundred people participated in the play.
The evening began with the minister of medicine, and after dinner it was possible to shut down for the performance of live music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo] on the dance, there were no mandatory night dress or dress.
Puritan parties enjoy health, work and local self-government.
The Ministry of Health organises a programme and holiday for employees for 400 000 Forints in their own building.
The Ministry of Labour Monika Lamperth's staff are not even officially invited to the evening meal, not even to the final working meeting.
It is estimated that 80 guests who, according to the press release, will receive only coffee and pancakes, so only 350 000 Forints will be available on the party.
Minister for Local Self-Government Gordon Bajniai will just join his staff in the Ministry of Local Self-Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organises a summer meeting, which expects 436 workers in its own large room.
At the holiday party it owes 2,500 Forints to the guest - the total amount includes the receptions with Swedish tables and accessories.
Since that time, Minister János Veres, the PM workers celebrate Christmas in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the evening will be missing, officiality strengthens not only ministerial appearances but also the afternoon driving time.
The Agriculture Resort is hosted by the 20th anniversary reception, the ministerial evenings are not able to do so.
The reception takes place in the town of Vajdahunyadvár in the City's crops and according to the Ministry's statement, 1,000 Forints per person are appointed for hundreds of guests.
The press department will report on a very simple reception to which only relevant foreign diplomats are invited in Hungary.
These annual prescriptions begin with a short medical treatment of the Minister and end with a small visit.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Schools and Cultures of Friday evenings do not even manage, has sent the portal [origo] to the appropriate printing department.
The price of summer holidays of the environment's resource in the printing department could not be reported.
In each case, four people were invited to attend the Festival at the Museum of Art and Industry.
Snap to Grid
The Association of the League's Committees, respectively, of the International Trade Councils (MOSZ) shall establish its Standing Committee on the Coordination of Unlimited Rates on Friday.
On Saturday, the protest public meeting will be held on Monday - on the day of the final vote on the health insurance law - the work will be stopped.
The action will certainly result in a serious interruption of transport, as rail transport is almost completely stopped and staff of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also be stopped within 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the Association of the League will meet with its National Business Councils with details jointly organised on Mondays.
There will also be the LIGA - MOSZ, which will coordinate the action on Monday.
On Saturday, a protestal public meeting will be held, and from the afternoon, the committee that joins the meeting will stop working for an hour of uncertainty if it does not reach agreement with the government.
This means that no deadline has been set for the end of the strike which will begin on the day of Parliament's vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament did not finally adopt the Health Insurance Act, the Committees shall immediately withdraw the call for candidates.
However, if the legal provision is rejected, the Standing Committees will meet and decide on another procedure.
Under the afternoon agenda of Parliament's meeting, it is also possible that the health insurance law will be voted until late in the evening, or at night.
As a result of a major interruption of transport on Monday, work will be stopped in the railways during an hour of uncertainty, the afternoon may stop part of Budapest's mass transport and more than half of the Volan company.
At the same time, it will come in many places to close half of the road.
To the challenge of the participants, the various committees and civil organisations were joined, whose list is still updated on the League's websites.
Some organizations have announced an emergency, others have announced temporary cessation of work.
On Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Council (MÁV) and the Independent Committee of Railway Workers (VDSZZZ) were unable to agree even on the services available, with the start of the summer holidays travelling on the train with more people.
According to the reports, from the beginning of the operation to 13 hours will be held in BKV, from 7 to 9 hours in the morning in Budapest Airport, the four-hour staff members of the LIGA energy industry will be appointed by the Board of Pediagians and the Democratic Committee of Pediagians.
The Hungarian doctors' union will be held throughout the country, the Democratic Committee of Health and Social Affairs (EDDSZ), which belongs to the Cooperation Forum of the Committees (SZEF), will be organised by a two-year inspection team.
The most important of the four requirements of the League's associations is that the government adopt a proposal for health insurance reform and submit a new concept to the public debate.
The second requirement is that a new way of calculating the pensions should be progressively completed from the next year.
Thirdly, the possibility of inclusion into the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Committee of Railway Workers (VDSZZZ), belonging to the League, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport concerning railways and expects another offer.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard increased the risk of the country
The activity of the Hungarian Guard, based on the support of Jobbik Magyarszágret in August of the year, according to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital Institute, has now increased in a number of respects to the political risk of Hungary and the whole area.
In the "risk alert" developed by the company, it says that, in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the biggest political risk is that "in the short term, the protection of existing ethnic tension between the Roma and the non-Romanian citizens of Hungary can be seen in the short term even to violent ethnic movements".
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is likely to lead to such action - it provides a research institute.
As he writes, all of this can be explained by one of the largest discrepancies of Hungarian political leaders: "the public debate on the Roma issue has left representatives of public life to representatives of radical and extremist political gatherings who could put a political strategy to the Roma-Madarian debate."
It deepens the problem, hinders normal dialogue, strengthens extremism and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - the trial of the institute.
In addition, the work of the Hungarian Guard, according to the research institute, has had a great impact on the attention of domestic and foreign media "to a significant extent showed the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to faith in the stability of the country and its democratic advancement".
The Institute recalls: the reorganization of Hungarian radical and ultra-right groups, which has been gaining ever greater publicity since the autumn of 2006, is that in Hungary a number of organizations have been established since 2007 which themselves are called "national housing".
"The common meaning of these groups is that they themselves define themselves as civil society while openly voting - and armed - the readiness of their members to carry out defence tasks (in the case of animal disasters, attacks of their own hands, violations of order), in addition to demonstrating the incompatibility of the police, the military, or the state," he adds.
It also notes that this is all happening in a way that seeks to undermine the most diverse political efforts based on society's resistance to politics and the parties to civil war.
Therefore, the emphasis on civilisation and the form of cooperation in the event of these acquisitions is not only necessary to avoid legal interference with judicial registration, but it is probably also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a factor in increasing risk from the perspective of neighbouring relations.
"In recent months they have been pointing to the Hungarian Guard immediately in several neighbouring countries as a potential source of danger, ultranationalist political representatives of some neighbouring countries want to apologize for their own anti-Semitary policy.
This may affect political stability in the area," he adds.
According to the research institute, the situation in Hungary in central and eastern Europe is not a united barrier, so the political risk for the region has increased as a whole.
As he writes, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is similar to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the Bulgarian guard are the massive Roman disturbances that erupted in one of the Sofia Squares (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used this to set up a guard with the organization's objective of "national housing".
In recent 17 years, according to it, in Bulgaria, the "Cikana terror" has been issued, but the state has remained inactive and aggressive, a reminder of the Political Capital Institute.
It adds that the initiative has led to a heated debate between the Bulgarian public.
As it goes on to say, the increase in the risk of ethnic violence indicates that certain Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced that they create their own guard on the evidence of resistance.
Since the Hungarian Guard's delivery activity is similar to the Bulgarian National Guard's activity, it is not excluded that the Hungarians also respond to the threat in a similar way by setting up their own home, we can learn from the risk of the political capital developed.
Attila Juhász, director of the Political Capital Institute, pointed out that the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, the risk analysis shall be issued every year and, if it finds anything that might have an impact on the risk change, they shall inform the public opinion, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
The holidays aren't everywhere free
In Hungary, the days of freedom are precisely determined by the law and the practice has already become a practice that is passed around the holidays, which waits for us a few times in the coming year.
In the European Union, even in America, the parties are not united.
The Hungarian legal system is breaking down national and state holidays and working days.
The days of working rest mostly refer to church holidays or to significant historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is a workday - in the New Year already so that people can rest after Silvestr.
During the year, we have a total of about a dozen free weddings.
The National Festival is the 15th anniversary of the revolution from 1848 to 23 October, the memorial day of the 1956 revolution.
On 20 August we celebrate the establishment of the state, the 1st of May, the 1st of November and the 2nd of November.
In addition, there are two-day holidays of the Grand night, the Summer and the Christmas.
Since our national, national, or religious holidays according to the calendar of holidays belong on the weekend, the practice of moving the working day into cases where we would work just one day before or after the holiday.
The price for an extended weekend is also that the previous Saturdays remain at work and at school.
When we are working on the day of the ceremony immediately before or after the ceremony, the Minister of Labour has been working for many years in a special report.
The legislation applies equally to all employees and their employees, public employees and public servants.
It shall not apply to companies and institutions which are in operation without interruption or in view of their appointment, even in the days of working rest.
This year will only change the working order by the end of the year: since December 24th, life in the country will be stopped, because according to experience, most people spend days between Christmas and Silvestr before "work" or thus use a saved permit.
In the next year, there are now several of our holidays, respectively, at the end of the week, so the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
First, the calendar will be changed around the holiday so that workers can stay home after four days of trial.
Saturday, 26th April will be a working day so that it can be on Friday 2nd May at rest.
Another move is related to the festival on 23 October: on Saturday, 18 October it will work instead of Friday 24.
At the end of the year, the next year will be able to spend entirely on the meaning of the holidays, because from December 24th, they will have almost all nonstop holidays and even though Silvestr is in the middle.
Six scary little ones you can hate your colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send out voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that we're not aware of: it's all "stops" every day at work.
The question is, if you get used to these minor inconveniences or set up gloves and an unclear situation that may be different, you will be careful to avoid them.
Type.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you they were looking for you from the marketing department," your colleague will tell you.
That's why you locked up a myth?
In a better case, he will regret and try to fix it, call the marketing department, and say that the report has forgotten to deliver (this is a less common solution).
Most often the thing is solved once I'm sorry.
Before it comes to a serious apology, it is good to think about what you might be able to prepare your colleagues for unpleasant moments, and try to do so wisely.
You borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more unpleasant than you're attracted to some writing, office needs or your phone, and they're not there.
You remember you put it on the table yesterday, but it's gone until the morning?
Or did you find your pen on the table of one of your colleagues that you considered lost?
Don't take anything away from your friends without permission, otherwise they'll be able to get you all caught up in things.
Don't take it out of the office of envelopes or beautiful paper because it can be unpleasant when you arrive early, and you will need them immediately.
The private life of fellows?
There's no good solution to stop the spread of the caps.
Who, who, who, what did he do?
Where and why?
Don't tell every one of your stories about the private lives of your fellows!
If any of them were to share their secrets with you, do not abuse their trust.
And hide what you have heard, and do not spy with your fellows when they know about it.
You report your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and call out for a severe headache, report your absence because you are not well, or you say you would rather rest today, think that your work, non-responsive tasks and work with a certain term will have to be done by someone else for you.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know that the next day you will not go to work, or that something can happen, why you will have to stay home, make it known that your colleagues and leaders will not be confronted with your absence until the next day.
Use, neglect, phone
Did you get involved in a job where your friend's back is going to throw you away?
You didn't want to be a witness to a phone conversation that would be better off hearing?
Don't beat your staff by using, singing, loud talking (to them above their head), or by pushing, standing black, voice of discomfort.
All of this can be destructive even when they are not confined to some project (sing, planning, organization).
Are you accusing others of being wrong?
If there is no time or if you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame yourself for your forgetfulness!
Don't call for any chaos in the office and delinquent colleagues!
Take it, if you've missed and someone paid for it, and make a loan!
Ask yourself how you could put things in order, make a mess!
Do you feel too much like home in the office?
Heats and potatoes: comfortable clothes at home, not even in the office!
Don't wear clothes for free time, even if it allows your profession!
Don't be silly, kiss your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in regular chess - and if that's what your profession demands, it's nice and elegant!
If a person wants to respond, he ceases to be interested
A walk in the usual early spring.
The radio calls special tunes: the sound sounds that connects to the electronic effects.
I'm adding a vote.
The song changes speed and adds to the previous tone of tone, then joins the women's congregation as a real clown.
At the mr2 station, there's a team of Zagar with the name Wings of Love.
Our home music life has not just wiped us away with a high - quality electronic tape.
But suddenly the tape looks quite different because you're just listening to a new Zagar album.
Yanderboie's appearances, a few new and interesting productions coming from the home digital subgroup, the whole picture changes slowly, and even if it's again in the garage rock mode with its milking into the guitar, and home electropop shows that it's something new under the sun.
Ballázs Zzezer started in Péticostel and he also played in the Yonderbo's chapel, until eventually - perhaps because two grand won't go into one castle - he took his own way.
With its project (Zagar) and music, which combines the elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, however, he began to skip until he was invited to compose film tracks (e.g.
in the film Ference Töröka "Szezon").
Its format, which played in the beginnings of smaller clubs, was known to the wider audience after wan2 hosted their first album from 2002 among the fifteen most important domestic volumes and declared Zagar in Yonderboie's company as the only domestic development that could be sold in the West.
Zagar and his hat are undoubtedly "in the course", even though no one has asked them if they are satisfied with this charm.
Capela responded as it is: made a new, better album.
The currently released album entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new paths, although the name itself is trying to create a connection with the original flights to Péticostel.
It's one version from the stock of the darker old chapel of Balázse Zsager.
The reference to the anterior, flight would be on the spot, but next to the etheric mood this song now appeared - in accordance with the spirit, the trend of time - more louder guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, the song of György Leaguei, who is currently working in England with The Puzzle, was presented on the platform in the park of Millenáris.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the stations mr2 Petzofi, playing the last time from the morning to the evening popular music, we started to admire the soft tunes of Wings of Love, filled with six home songs (underground Divas).
So it's all right. (?)
Portal hvg.hu told Balázse Zsager.
hvg.hu: In relation to this new hit, the question is, how much remains what you're playing, the piano song?
Ballázs Zzáser: Definice crown song for me doesn't mean much.
I think there are two different boxes of easy music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, subgroup music can be flat, they don't say anything, and it can only happen because of sales that makes it commercial.
However, a good deposit can change from honest internal needs.
In this spirit, the position adopted depends on language and national boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the opening of the Hungarian and foreign audience against your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign, especially from us to the west, there is a light song of greater tradition.
It's not only teenagers and people in 20 but older.
Many more follow the change in the ease of music around them because they also regard it as part of modern culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Does it matter to you who, where and how much of your music is listening?
B.Z.: Of course, it's a good feeling that our concerts go as far as people go.
But we never made music for the market.
We don't have music for a purpose, but for what reason.
The role of the audience can be played more at concerts where each other's influence is already working, but it is only hidden in unexploitable changes at the moment.
Still, I realized that if a person wants to express his opinion to the public, then he will stop being interested.
hvg.hu: How much do you want to follow the example of Yonderboie?
He's working alone, and he's been building his career more than we've ever been to the west.
B.Z.: We are not actually going his way, regardless of how our music is sometimes being interpreted.
We're more team players who rely on each other's musical presence and let her grow up.
At first, of course, it wasn't going to be avoided that our jobs were not linked to Yonderboie's funds, but a few of us were separated from his hat and set out another way.
hvg.hu: At the top of the station mr2 Petófi the Wings of Love was first obtained.
Many heard the name Zagar first in connection with this fund.
You've obviously opened up a more popular style?
B.Zs.: We shouldn't have written a hit to sell a board.
It's more about that song.
We thought of it as a final album that we tried to release here the previous sound organ and more complex themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose these six songs?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a group.
Then the idea came to form this congregation with a soloist home music scene with a good voice.
So this six-year-old congregation - then Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judy Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Nemeth - which we then turned to Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you just think the song like this, or did the girls turn something on it?
B.Zs.: The fund had existed for a long time in an instrument version when the material was collected on the table, we said that something else would be needed for this fund.
After the accords, he called for a party to join him.
That night, I sang songs to him, which girls later learned.
The whole thing came out almost first and very spontaneous.
I remember how it got back, but, of course, there was a need for Divy.
With my voice, it wouldn't work like this.
hvg.hu: As on the board, at the concert it seemed that the girls were in the background.
They don't have just one (except Judy Jay), they don't have their own roles, they sing together and they're not more loud than song, so the song just doesn't make them sing.
They're back on the ice, too.
I mean, is that reasonable?
B.Z.: The fact that they stayed behind was only due to technical problems.
That we didn't want to divide the solo role, it's logical.
And this is about forgetting our ego a little bit, where it belongs, and just letting those wings go, loving pride.
I've agreed that this euphoric attitude that we felt when this song was born felt the other.
hvg.hu: What was the most work with?
B.Zs.: During the composition of the song, even with one, the toughest cuts came out more when moving.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play on the concert hall, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work the grooves long, and then all of a nice little bit found his place like in some designer.
hvg.hu: Which money from the new desk is your favorite?
B.Zs.: It's always changed by the concert and by the fact that I've already released the board.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth a Never The Same.
A betrayer risked billions of minors
It's a sales defrasurant.
This is how Jeroma Kerviela, the French banking giant of the Société Generale, owner of the Turkish Commercial Bank.
She's here for him, but she's been free of five billion euros.
Probably, though, Kerviel seemed to be just a big player who wanted to get rid of his colleagues and was definitely not capable of it.
Unlike all large banking houses, the crisis in the American mortgage market has always been different.
"It's a lot worse," said his superiors, who sent the police to him.
However, as a result of the comments made by the French media, such as the newspaper Le Monde, it was the person who at the end of last year had a profit of EUR 1.6 billion from his sales.
Crisis Not Only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," says the statement.
In summer, he was able to create half a billion euros right in the US crisis.
The opportunity that he felt at the beginning of the year.
In the meantime, reports have been published that so-called sub-prime mortgages provided by low-cost customers or those who in the past had problems with payment will have problems.
The impact on the entire economy of this crisis had, but it had no effect.
He didn't believe it and he was right.
By the end of the year, his profit had dropped to 1.6 billion euros.
"Now that I've made the first half billion, I didn't know how to tell it," Kerviel admits and adds that he left nothing for himself.
Throughout the interview, he admitted that he had lied to the records so that he wouldn't get to it.
He was even able to get rid of his boss, even when he started to take care of his business with the Eurex burs.
Risk was successful
He's afraid he's coming?
Not at all.
"I thought that the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank was comforting."
Where did he want to risk so much?
In his position, he had to be progressively prepared.
He came to the Society General in 2000 quietly after studying at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary moved around $111,000.
Two years later he was already a nurse, and in 2005 he became a self-employed nurse with a yearly salary of $90,000.
Still, he knew that he would never do as much as the rest of them did.
"I already knew in my first conversation in 2005 that they were looking at me.
For my education and also for professional and personal development," Kerviel described researchers.
But soon after his arrival, the first big success came.
Thanks to Allianz's action, during the bombings in London, he was still at the bottom of this title of half a billion euros.
And it was a self-sustaining mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you make it, we'll leave you.
"It's like snowball," he said to the police.
But the bosses knew about everything, whether they were showering.
"As long as I made the money, my eyes were closed."
Only the morning came at the beginning of this year.
He spent a billion euros in one day.
After a weekend in the afternoon, he wanted to freeze.
When he came to work on Monday, he didn't work in the bank anymore.
And the bank reported a couple of days later that it was five billion euros for him.
And how did they get to him?
I've been exposed to my license.
"I've only chosen four days in the past year.
A broker who has no permission is a liar who doesn't want anyone to watch his records," Kerviel concluded.
Czech has a chance to get 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech Government representatives of the European Commission signed nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can earn 14 billion euros in the coming years (about 365 billion kroner).
The total amount of the total amount available to Czech Republic from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion kroner will come from seven operational programmes to the regions.
Czech companies will be able to get around 100 billion crowns from the Podnique and innovation program.
The most money up to 150 billion will be directed to transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the funds available to the CR from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will be managed in the next year with a share of $90.8 billion.
The Business and Innovation Programme should serve businesses and companies to obtain funds for innovative enterprises.
Companies should obtain funding for the implementation of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the implementation of more efficient organisational methods.
The EU funds will be used to manage cash flows within the framework of the new host countries, at least successful.
Twentieth-year sentence for the representative of Nicaragua confirmed the court
On Thursday, the appeal court in Nicaragua approved a twenty-year sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for a financial fine of $100 million (less than $1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in his home prison on his arrest near the Nicaraguan Metropolis.
If the head of this Central American state is sometimes returning to the network from 1997 to 2002, it is not clear by the AP agency at this time.
According to the president of the Appeals Chamber, Ilean Pérez will now be concerned with prison officials whether Germany allows his sentence to be served at home or he is in prison.
Four years ago, the court showed Germany that he regularly transferred government money to foreign companies' accounts in Panama.
These companies were firm and accounts were in fact belonging to its neighbours and closest supporters.
Some of these money was then spent on the fund that Germany based on the funding of its voluntary campaign in 2001.
So we're allowed to settle.
That's right.
The state budget was adopted.
What's this extraordinarily extraordinary budget?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and accepted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
This year, Loni went through with the support of ČSSD because he was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD was unable to allow his rejection.
Unlike the Russian debate before the government's vote on mistrust, nothing dramatic has been done this time.
The Ambassador's speech was traditionally viewed, although the most influential, the law was adopted in silence.
It's a certain paradox.
Each government begins and ends in individual chapters and budget items, whether it likes or dislikes someone.
The budget is an essential part of the policy, but it is hidden by powerful opposition from the government.
That's a little more grateful, and that's why he's paying much more attention in the media.
Policy issues are much more interesting for the public than for the fair number.
The state budgets in the previous social democratic governments have suffered three upsets, which are not able to solve at once for 2008:
The first of these is a high proportion of the law of compulsory, such as compulsory expenditure, which are not only pensions but also social doses that have been approved in the past year by the silent "coalice" of ČSSD and KSCHM.
The second is poor management as a consequence of the lack of first air.
Thirdly, there are public finances deficits, i.e. urban and urban budget deficits.
However, the greatest risk is not the deficit of the state budget.
He's public and relatively controlled.
However, the timing of the bombing is the deficit of urban and urban budgets.
Many seniors, in addition to money from taxes, payments and loans from the bank, have received additional investment resources, often openly issued bonds that were unduly owed to their offices.
In recent years, they have been able to pay these debts for the mass sales of energy and other intelligence networks that have received from the state of privatization.
Now they don't have this resource anymore.
If we maintain only official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy has been going on for many years, just like the rest of the world, a growing phase, which is still under the ČSSD.
It was a unique opportunity for her governments to provide public funds in order.
Instead, the state was increasingly indebted.
Other countries, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more wisely than our Republic.
It's a huge shame, especially for the past government.
We are at least at the risk of poverty among the countries that are, at the global level, at the same time.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, have been entirely offset in recent years.
Although it has been possible to cut down some of the unreasonably populist expenditure approved this year before the elections, if in the near future it will not be able to move the limit of income to pension and pension reform, then it will actually end any policy in this country and be able to rule by any person who will then only manage it.
With little emphasis it can be said that government policies will become officials, mechanically dividing most of the money paid on pensions and social taxes.
Therefore, the annual budget cannot be revolutionary, but can only stop the withdrawal of normal expenditure by mandaters.
The planned deficit of 70 billion per year 2008 would be very significant if the previous governments did not contribute in the last ten years as much as they could.
If we do not want to really get to become only officials from government policies, then we must be patient and reach this very strong cohesive government, who realizes that the state can only do as much as it can to obtain tax and pay, be content with the preparation of other reform laws.
Only those can be progressively achieved by a balanced national budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The United States Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the Central Banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
The exchange market is going to get more than a hundred billion dollars through auctions.
In these auction banks, the interest rate is the result of which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, U.S. Fed sent $44 billion to the auction, and four more to the European and Swiss Central Bank.
This is the first time that the Central Banks of the United States agreed on such a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step has to solve the greatest economic problem, so growing lack of free capital that banks could borrow," wrote Bernard Baumohl from the Economic Outlook Group in his report to customers.
"The coordinated share of central banks has reduced the likelihood of recession in the United States from 65 per cent to 10%," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already come to $60 billion for unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect another billion dollars.
"Central banks need to be truly afraid of what else can follow when they have decided for this procedure," the ABS key economist Amro Kieran Davies said.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
The central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficulty access to loans, they will be more inclined to lend their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the US economy to the recession with possible effects on the global economic growth.
The central banks thus decided after the failure to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London Interbank rate, which is used to finance the money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about the mutual lending of money, even though the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and Britain decreased several times during the fall of their interest rates.
"It will have the same effect as the next drop in rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts are not convinced that the steps of the central banks contribute to the crisis because they do not solve the basic problem, and that is the market of property in the United States.
Klaus: The ecological debate is unbelievable
Global climate change is the most damaging to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again expressed concern about global warming.
The crisis has now reached the end of the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Modra, never a green planet, he indicated that ecological debate is unbelievable.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only for the structure of the conference, which creates a critical mix of representatives of government and non-governmental organizations, but also for the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that it carries out and the reality.
"The debate is completely unstructured, it's just a flash of words that are a substitute for addressing current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President emphasized that her theme is very important to him, and that is why she is so involved in it.
He also expressed satisfaction over the fact that the book is also published in German translation because, as he said, "I sometimes only meet with the characters of my opinion."
So now the stakeholders can read his unexplained existence.
Klaus pointed out that the network is not a climatologist, but according to his view, it has enough assumptions to write such books.
However, he is an academic, capable of monitoring and considering professional experience, has a statistical experience, and is also a national economy.
In the main conclusions of the book, it was pointed out that climate change has continued to change and its changes are therefore normal that there is no consistent opinion of all scientists that the consequences of these changes are not too large and therefore not too serious and therefore poses a threat and that efforts to affect climate development are essential, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
Moreover, as a person with experience with totality, he is considered to be hostile to the unexplained views of others, which he feels as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He explained on the questions of the present repetition that it is not "a reasonable protection of the environment, but a military environmentalism which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits".
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver has not been able to replace 600 thousand people
Six hundred thousand drivers were late and were unable to replace the old driver’s license, whose validity was extended by the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for a change to be made so that the authorities will still be able to issue a new document by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year, the driver's status would be placed on the road without payment.
According to the authorities, they did not change the licence mainly to those who no longer want to run.
While citizens report a sudden decline in interest in the exchange of drivers, the authorities in the Metropolis are affected by requests and interest in the exchange of evidence this week has grown.
The Magistrate employs about 2,000 clients every day.
There's half an hour's noise waiting in front of the front.
In Prague the driving licence has not changed the volume of 140,000 drivers.
The presentation of the new order takes twenty days.
But it's possible to request an issue within a short period of five days.
In such a case, the driver will pay five hundred crowns.
Motorists who are not required to exchange the licence by the end of the year and go on the road without a pay driver will be threatened by a cold strike.
The prosecutor will pay at least two thousand crowns.
But the police can also deal with the breach.
In the case of an administrative procedure, the sample shall be equal to 2500 kroner.
According to earlier information, he could get an account from a worker and a person who doesn't eat anywhere.
He could pay $30,000 in cash.
In the past, the Ministry has called on the authorities to be peaceful and to obtain the highest thousands of prison sentences.
According to the speaking Ministry of Transport, Karl Hanzelky's tenets are not threatening anyone.
The guide is according to the evidence in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not a civil order that every person has to pay.
People who don't want to run anymore should be given a driver's license.
It shall be sufficient to send it or send a recommended mail to the competent public authority.
At the end of the year, the orders issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be paid.
Motorists, however, have to gradually change other types of driving instructions.
People with evidence from 1994 to 2000 have another three years to change.
The submissions issued between 2001 and 2004 shall be completed in December 2013.
According to Hanzelky, there are 2.6 million other documents.
The Court reduced the penalties for detectives associated with Berdyche.
The former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Konıřík, who have been convicted of a criminal relationship with the gang of David Berdych, go to prison for thirty and ten years.
With the final sentence, the Prague Supreme Court decided to reduce their punishments, one year and two years.
It initially threatened the Purgatory Committee's detectives for the fight against organised crime for 14 and 12 years.
Against today's decision, it can no longer be dismissed, it can only be allowed to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also accused of this cause, but he is waiting for the first stage.
In other processes, however, he has already been sentenced to 16 years in the account.
He can't get any more.
In January, the National Court of Justice recognized, in particular, the participation of 19 minors, and today the Supreme Court decided to withdraw 16 of them.
Most of the alleged complaints have been rejected since the initiation of the investigation with regard to the construction of the case.
According to the Inter-Agency Council, police officers, in addition to the agreement with Berdyche, provided information to the criminals from police sources, covered each of the minor infringements and helped the gang members avoid criminal liability.
Gang gave 30 percent of it to Opava and Conyry.
The complaint concerns the criminal activity of the gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, the thief, whose victims suffered many serious health concerns, but also abuse of the rights of the public worker and unauthorized armed forces.
During domestic visits, the police found illegally held guns, fires with steel cores, laser detectors or planes.
Gang, according to the charges, came to the robbery for ten million crowns.
In addition to the absence of two hundred men in this process, the courts have been legally recognized by the rest of the Berdys and a number of other people.
Other men in the area of Berdycha still speak before the court in another trial, some of the cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The main figures have already been avoided by Tomáši Potto and Maroshi Šulej, who live in Ireland, where they are waiting for a definitive decision on their departure to the Czech Republic.
Number of child replacements: 12 million
In exchange for children in the family, the lawyer of the injured family Igor Veleba wants 12 million kroner damages after the grassroots hospital, plus court charges.
For every mother for three million, for parents for two million and for children for a million.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the Ondréj Hospital is therefore not fully in line with the proposal of Veleby.
"We reject such a requirement, it is very high," said Doyle after today's meeting.
"But in order for us to have an opinion on this counter-narcotication, we need a finding trial that the opponent has left.
We'll find out if there's any value to say.
But we keep in mind that it will be in statistics for all," pointed out Donetal.
According to him, the amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the family's case, Jablon's family wanted to spend every month without raising his biological daughter, millions of dollars.
He served many as a basis for dealing with the harmful finding that he had developed the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motole.
Children’s parents, according to psychologists and psychiatrists, endured mental depression and stress at various stages and depth.
The stress situation improved, even though it was reported that the replacements of newborns had not been prevented.
Women are re-equipped with the actual trauma of survival and with what is happening right now, the contents of Veleba.
Veronica and Nikol exchanged health care for their families on Monday, 9 December.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Czech Republic and Veronica to Libor Brojo and Jaroslav Trojan to Jablonov.
Heytman Exocini Miloš Explanation passed out at the end of October each of the family’s 100,000 kroner on the return of expenses that caused them to miss the emergency hospital that the country is planning.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are guaranteed by the law on liability for damage.
In the event of an error, they have to agree to the reserve fund, and they can only ask for assistance from the organizer.
The courts have already acknowledged relatively low damages, sums have been calculated according to the table in a series of statistics, except for millions of crowns.
Polívka came about the Valais kingdom
Bolek Polívka has won a dispute about the sign of the Valais kingdom.
According to the Austrian national court, he first used the designation of the Valais king, but the project had built a long-term work for the team around Tomáše Harabiš, who worked with the emperor.
The pool didn't take part today.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and the client is calling.
"The idea is that Mr. Harabish and his team are taking a stand at the Bolka Polivky public," said the Polish lawyer after the trial.
According to him, in the words of the Valais kingdom, the priest and the comets are the only ones who have been trained.
He has the same opinion as Harabish.
"It's almost ten years' work for us.
Making money and thinking of action," he said.
According to him, there's a dispute of money.
"After years they realized that the project was successful and could have something from it.
They want to interrupt our work," he added.
Lurrative business
According to the court, the Valais king first used Polívka in his television series.
In 1993, her hero Radoslav Brzobohetý crowned her.
But this did not depend on the purpose of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came up with the idea of producing whales.
From the original recession, trade and lucrative business activities were excluded, which Haribish then referred to the establishment of the company of the Valais kingdom.
In 1997 Polívka agreed with the introduction of his name and signature in passports and even offered his followers the discounts when visiting his farm and the theatre exhibitions.
Who's sitting on the throne?
The Court also stated today that Harabish had only used a holo idea that Polivka had published in the manifesto for his business purpose.
"Populati Boleslav Polivky's project of the Valais kingdom has certainly helped," the judge said.
But she added that the soul project was Harabish and his team, who had been actively involved with him.
The collaboration of the corrupted parties today continued until 2000, when Haribish organized an official corunovation for Polivka in Vsetina.
From that time on, however, the controversy began between Polívka and Haribish, which raised the "King of Boleslav I. chosen for the fur".
The leading role in the kingdom was then played by the singer Jarmila Šulák as the queen's mother on the ground of Haribish.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Haribish and his company that the court rejected today.
Clearly, it could bring Harabish to the dispute with the silenced complaints about the throne and half of the princess.
He's supposed to be coming out of the new king.
He still didn't want the details and the deadline.
"We don't want anything to rush.
It should be something like King's ride to Slovakia.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
And Mr. Polívka can sign up quietly," Haribish added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: cross-sectional
Actually, I never missed Peugeot 206.
Its driving properties were not very much, the quality of sorting, handling and also of products would be marked slightly by average.
But now there's Peugeot 207 on the market, and that's a lot better.
And the van called SW is still going on and it doesn't make me think better.
When I was testing classic hackback Peugeot 207, for example, I ran into the head space on the back seat.
This is already the problem here, because the van career means that there will be no longer than two meters in this direction.
Year of the World
I'm going through very quickly so I can't get back.
It's about the entire design that I've got the only escape for the poor middle tunnel.
Here I would appreciate more designer inventions when the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and they're there the times when we could ride on short seats or shifts.
The side direction also significantly improved against model 206.
What's in the space is still here to feel the increase in the size of the career.
There's already a lack of space on the head in the van.
Cover Art
It's the main driver of this car, so he's his assistant.
I have to evaluate this as very readily available (and also through the opening window) and as a well-compliant.
Sound spots are equipped with durable rubber, which is an ideal compromise.
It doesn't stop, it can slow down and it keeps harder objects.
But let's get together on the surface.
This is according to the table in the basic arrangement 428 l, which is more than the average value against competition.
However, it is not against the best car in the Czech Republic that this class is selling - the injury of Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW to a new generation of youth products, then we'll find Peugeot remains of a very famous 52 litres.
This value is considered to be critical for a foreign country or for placing on a cart.
But if I'm going to raise the position, I still have to mention the exact same floor after the second row or very low line.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested vehicle has been equipped with a powered four-wheeler of 1.6 l with an output of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, it's supposed to look like a sixteen-year-old who's driving a family hackback.
He's quiet, he's having a little consumption, and he's especially breathing.
If I compare her to a period of damage that seems to be mildly caused, like she's having a tight grip on the air, then I can only be overrun with her.
Price of invitation
The price of the car is not human.
We must remember, however, that we tested a properly equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good motor.
The basic price of the vehicle with a heavy quarter of 329 900 Kč is still coming.
Our farm is 410 900 Kč, which is enough already.
The Premium tested equipment then comes for another 80,000 Kč design.
Only we still had major airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic firefighting, electrical control of the back windows...
Just the train is standing all over 531 900 Kč.
It's a lot, but you're going to get a lot of extra equipment in Fabie and you're going to get to a lot of the same number.
So he doesn't stay until he decides for the sign.
The integration of Slovenian pupils in British schools will not take place
The British schools have children from Eastern Europe, which is a cause of concern to local residents about further development of local schools.
The integration of Eastern Europe is still under attack on a number of obstacles.
British schools even record cases when disputes between immigrants and children of indigenous origin persist in violence.
The problem with integration of children from Eastern Europe to British schools well illustrates the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local residents and Slovenian immigrants begin to arise.
The hooks, gloves, and the cuts between the jaws were also transferred to the relationship between the parents.
The situation went so far as to hold a Slovenian woman in Chatham's police station, who is carrying a train of ten-year-old chicks.
She's accused of being threatened by a boy with racist charges.
The police had to arrest two female girls after the attack on the Slovenian passenger.
Boys were apparently using racist marks and cast stones on him.
"When we went home, a boy jumped on a bus stop and started to swim on us.
When I told him to let it go, he threw himself on us with apples and vegetables and then left his behind," she described another unpleasant arrival for the mother of Slovenian cheeses.
The problems are on both sides.
One of the local seats even marked disputes with passengers from Eastern Europe for the struggle for survival.
The above examples show that the atmosphere at British schools between locals and immigrants is beginning to burn.
In Britain, there are 70 thousand Slovaks who have intended to work here.
A total of 30,000 Slovenian students are visiting British schools.
Cheapest island of Karibik
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from yourself, you can do it if you choose the right thing.
Gold and white beaches, high waves, or sea, quiet as a fish.
Palmy and all inclusive with readers offering pizza, ice cream and heavy cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf a roll.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you will find it in a full and even richer account.
Just one island, but you'll find a lot more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antils.
For the Spaniards, Cuba was the treasure of their acquisition of America.
Columbus identified her as the most beautiful place ever to be seen by the human eye.
Havana became a warehouse and a transfer of funds that the Spaniards in America bought and transferred to Europe.
And then the American era came.
Hotel National grew up at the same end of the 20th year.
He allowed him to be one of the heads of the American Mafia Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the United States (especially for bans) was welcomed and supported by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
His guests were mine.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high houses grew, after large bullfights, a car that belonged to the cultural symbols of the 50th century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a seat in San Francisco de Paula, a cousin from Havana, and in Cojímar he had his jacket.
At the walls of the Bodeguity del Medio, they left their signatures of the stars of the showbusinism and politics of America.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on walls in the Havan Bodeguité.
At the bar of the precious National hotel, you will be awarded a cocktail at your request.
And this 50-year-old cult car is driving after Havana for a long time, because once brought in the yellow and the yellow air has gone down a long way.
Being Havana, especially her oldest part, is a great reminder, although there are not so many beautiful colonial memories in the neighborhood as right there.
Other places also change into beauty, maybe Trinidad.
Given that travel movement brings so much money, its development is green.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varadera, the province of Holguín and islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another libel, which is unique in the world and is especially appreciated by trainers.
A third of the exposed plants were taken into the sugarcane after the hard wheels of the steam and engine trains.
Their train park hasn't been up for decades, and so they've been there to see functional machines, whose members are still only in museums.
Where are you going?
This most famous place of the most visited is Kuby.
And so, Varader, or Havan, you don't have to write too much about it.
It's probably just to mention that in the Hemingway sensitivities mentioned above, it's a museum, and whoever likes this writer should not leave the visit alone.
The Valley of Vinjales One of the smallest villages of Cuba is the valley of Vináles in the west of the island.
Bad vegetation is growing from the base of the fencing.
The potentials, fencing homoleums and rocks are firmly dwindled from the bottom of the valley, and the fertile soil is covered in their branches, which are also the outer layer covered with a thick furrow.
The valley is the place where the most perfect Cuban tobacco can be grown.
You can meet with his final appearance if you visit some of the Havan factory for the production of sweeteners.
Maybe someone's going to be interested, and that's what happened to Major Earth's Chilean section.
Trinidad
An old town that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonization of the islands.
His fame and wealth brought him trade with children and sugar.
The wealth has turned into the beauty and appearance of a small city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, highly influenced by later French commentators, has not changed in almost four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray, is so bright that there was no road there in the 50th century that would be connected to the rest of the country.
That isolation helped him stay away.
There was nothing going on there, and that's why it didn't work, everyone was happy to have a roof over his head.
If a person has more time on Trinidad than one afternoon, then they stand for it and look at interesting places nearby, such as the beach Playa Ancón, or the valley of Sugar.
At night it belongs to Casa de la Música, which lives after the set and music in it hangs over the morning.
Baracoa
The town on the very east of Cuba is some of the fastest on the island.
The teacher's opinion is already affecting the road itself.
The two roads leading from Guantánamo have to overcome the heights and members of the mountains and go through the nature of which human activity has almost been unaware.
The Kuby's exit exhibition has been written by UNESCO thanks to a dark undamaged nature on the list of world heritage.
They're doing the best chocolate there, in the church they have the Columb Cross (in fact it was about a hundred years after the Columbo Flood) and from the hill where some hills and today's El Castillo Hotel are located, it's seen several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, cream, sweeteners, on the top of Sierra Maestra, on the fifth of the pig and island of Isla de Pinos, on the Cabaret Tropicalan, on the Holy of Cuban patrons Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, the African religions that identify the descendants of some children, it would be possible to describe a lot of the page.
But, as it is called, it's better to see once.
Afghanistan's allies are passive, say American
Few soldiers and lack of necessary equipment affect the United States of America during the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO's Minister of Defence Robert Gates should plan a specific plan for the next year.
The mission in Afghanistan is not promulgated according to the image, the representatives of the countries in the Scottish Edinburgh, which have units in the southern part of the country.
In view of the growing opposition by the Taliban, today eight participating States are also discussing other allies' plans and coordination.
While the United States, through the Minister of Defence Robert Gates, called NATO units for greater activity this week, Great Britain sees a priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan Government and strengthening development assistance.
"The development in Afghanistan is massive, but military power can only be part of a solution.
This is another way for citizens to start further economic and security development on their own," British Defence Minister Des Browne told BBC Station.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels is, according to the U.S. Army's data, the highest in the last five years.
The number of violent acts rose by 27 per cent last year, in the southern province of Helmand up to 60 per cent.
NATO has 40 thousand troops in Afghanistan, from which the fourth quarter is located in southern Afghanistan.
According to the United States, however, the associations reached the same limit in the organisation and equipment unit.
In particular, they require other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the specific goals for the next time and how to achieve them," said Gates.
In a similar way today, NATO General Jaap de Hoop also spoke.
"I am not happy with what we have in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's a little," said Reuters De Hope at the end of the class talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive?
Among the countries involved in the past few months, disputes also arise as to whether all associations lead to maximum levels in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticised for passports.
"The Germans in Afghanistan have a relatively number of representations.
But they are found in areas where there are at least violence and fighting threats are not as high as we are in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British Blue Book of Sun this week marked German soldiers for the Lenochs.
"Afghan runners have been discovered: Germans are playing while our enemies are fighting," wrote Sun in a material filled with photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German image was moved to the counter-attack and filmed a picture of the British unit at the branch in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will be added to the billion in 2009
On each Czech side, there is a state debt of over 84,000 kroner.
The total debt was at the end of the seven hundred and forty-two billion dollars.
The government was planning to borrow $159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of the December, the Ministry had reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner due to better development of the government budget.
The State debt of the Czech Republic reached the end of the seven billion dollars.
In nine months of the year, it grew to $40.2 billion.
Since June, he's been down by 13.4 billion dollars.
The Ministry of Finance has thus confirmed its data on State debt since the beginning of October.
On each Czech side there is a debt of over 84,000 dollars.
For the whole summer year, the state owed more than 111 billion dollars.
"At the same time it seems that due to the lower deficit for the next year, we could cross the boundaries of the billions of crowns until 2009.
The next year it would be a debt to move between 900 billion and a billion crown," said the iHNed.cz analyst Patricia Finance David Marek.
Similarly, the analysis of Next Finance Vladimír Pikora: "To exceed one billion we could get through 2009.
When it will depend on the next budget that we don't know yet.
If it were to show that the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to draw more and more, this could be achieved in 2010.
But I don't expect this change," he said.
Rotate Right
State debt creates central government debt and leads in particular to the accumulation of State budget losses.
The State debt shall be financed by depositary bonds, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt has already been estimated at $38.5 billion to 719.4 billion this year.
The foreign debt of the state has grown from 1.7 billion dollars to 123.3 billion dollars this year.
The so-called commercial state debt at the end of the season reached 803.3 billion kroner and since June it reached 13.7 billion kroner.
The average level of State debt increased by 6.5 years.
"The total debt per month for the first to third quarter has increased by 13 per cent, which is really very much on how the economy works.
It's interesting that growth is generated mainly in debt accounts where it's 20 per cent increase.
It's bad that debt grows, but on the other hand, it shows that it's going to deal with what it's going to do when there's a rain reform," Piko said data.
Better than expected
According to the 2007 State debt financing and management strategy, the government was planning to borrow 159.2 billion dollars this year.
At the beginning of the December, the Ministry had reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner due to better development of the government budget.
The amount is created primarily by the deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach $76 billion this year instead of the estimated $91.3 billion.
There is also a planned maximum resource for the Czech Consolidation Agency of 13.3 billion kroner, a ten-billion-dollar reserve for the payment of payments, the financing of State debt for 43 billion kroner and the payment of loans from the European Investment Bank over 1.8 billion kroner.
A woman has to be brought to court in the Charter today because she gave the name of a pigeon bear.
The British teacher, who was in Sudan for Islam, was sentenced to fifteen days in prison on Thursday night by one of the Charteral Courts, as her lawyer pointed out.
The British was accused of letting six to seven years of pleas to give a false bear the name Mohamed despite the fact that any display of the prophet of Islam is prohibited.
It was a detailed punishment for wounds.
This British four-year-old teacher, who was attending the Union High School in the Sudan Charter, was arrested on Sunday at home and accused of assaults on Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, after which several complaints were lodged by the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
Our story begins in fact already in September when the student in question requests his six to seven years of demand to choose a name for a third-fucking bear.
"Out of the children's mouth, eight names are known, including Hasan, Abdullah and Mohamed," reports school director Robert Boulos.
After voting in class, 20 of the 23 children finally choose as the favorite name Mohamed.
Of course, Mohamed is the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all, it is a very widespread Christian name in Sudan.
Then the children created a book for their class with a photograph of the bear, a book entitled "My name is Mohamed".
The bear had no shield on her own with that name, but the problem is in the prophet's own appearance, considered to be a violation of Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, confirmed that she knew her well and that she would never do anything that would be offensive to any religious belief: "I only regret that she asked the children to vote for some name," according to him only about "inconsistencies".
Such a view is shared by many teachers who describe it as "very attentive to their complaints" and add that "never in class does not talk about religion".
Remember that the Christian name Mohamed is also the second most commonly known Christian name in Britain, in English, writes fourteen different ways.
This Christian name often chosen by Muslim families represents the way in which to teach the prophet (often done for the first time).
What, though, are the rules regarding the use of this Christian name?
Is it possible, for example, to give them toys?
Of course, it's a question of interpretation.
At the last round of the meeting in Vienna, they did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
It's not gonna work.
The Serbs and Kosovos of Albania ended in the middle of the morning in the sixth and last round of talks in Baden, in the Russian Republic, without being able to overcome the different views on the future status of this separatist province.
"It is politically acceptable that both parties were unable to reach an agreement on the status," said European co-ordinator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the area is "in the garden" and called on Bélehrad and Pristina to maintain peace and to be ready for dialogue after the meeting.
"We do not expect violence in the near future, however, to enter the financial period," he added, "it is evident that the situation is tense."
The meeting ends on 10 December.
The three leaders, composed of representatives from the European Union, the United States and Russia, shall be finalised in Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 per cent of Albanian speaking population is created, could be shown in a clearer light until 10 December, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian co-founder Alexander Bocan-Charčenko have to deliver their report to the UN Security Council.
Discussions in Baden, near Vienna, represent six and at the same time the last round of negotiations since the UN, in August this year, Trojk believed in a new resolution.
The American and Europeans are counting on the end of the debate on 10 December.
Russians, who have already blocked the independence of Kosovo in the UN Security Council, remain on the move to continue after this maximum period.
"Russia has been and remains compelled to resolve the compromise solution," Bocan-Charčenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of management of the international community, the West views Kosovo's independence under the EU's sole solution.
Priština declares that in the event that the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is prepared to declare independence unilaterally.
Beléhrad takes on extended autonomy.
"Oh, my God, we haven't reached any agreement," announced President of Kosovo's self-government Fatmir Sejdi in a research hotel, where since Monday this "last chance meeting".
Hashim Thaci, former rebel leader of Kosovo Albanians and future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
However, he added that the autonomy plan presented by the Belgrade "is a history that leads to murder and deportation".
"Dominic Effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic is of the opinion that the compromise continues to come to mind and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of the unilaterally declared independence of the province.
Beléhrad is particularly concerned with the "domain effect" in the area which is still unstable as a result of the war for independence in the 1990s.
"It doesn't mean for Serbia," he said, "that compromise is impossible."
The next day, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions should be made by the Security Council, in which the Russian Federation has the right to vote.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"For Serbia it is only a friendly solution from the Security Council," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica declared.
"This meeting lasted two years.
It must end as it began: under the Security Council."
Journalists Fatmir Sedjius replied that "the last word of the status will have a Kosovo parliament" and added that if a unilateral declaration of independence from Albanian-speaking citizens was made, "after agreement" would pass through the West.
Bush appealed to the Israelis and the Palestinians
At the launch of the International Peace Conference in Annapolis in Maryland, released from its appeal, American President George Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians finally agreed to a joint declaration.
He pointed out that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbás agreed at the immediate beginning of the negotiations with the intention of always solving the ongoing conflict between the two nations for 60 years.
In the presence of both Bush men, he promised to do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestine must destroy "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must end with colonial activities, Bush announced and reminded both sides of the responsibilities that flow from "road maps" to the peace they adopted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and Palestine's independent leader Abbas are aimed at "to conclude a peace agreement that would solve all unsolved issues without exception, including the issue of centrality".
This statement includes three questions that are in the core of the dispute between Israel and Palestine: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab remnants who were spared in the conflict in 1948 from their homes in the territory of the state of Israel today.
Abbas took the words after the American President and stressed that the next meeting would be "sound and essential" and that it would touch all aspects of the solution, by referring to "Jerusalem, rivers, borders, colonies, water, security, except for others".
Then Olmert, who expressed his opinion that the subsequent settlement should be "first and continuous" and that it should be "dedicated to be closed during 2008.
Bush identified the end of 2008 as a term for the implementation of his "Visions of two states", of Palestinian and Israeli people who are next to him.
Saudi Arabia has made a commitment from Bushem to that effect even before it decided to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is successful in Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries, which Israel offers peace for the release of all Arab territories banned in 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis refers to the "crisis in the Middle East events, especially because it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", according to Prince Saúd's interview, which provided an Arabic-speaking debt to the protected Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutors, the police are not responsible.
What happened on Sunday?
As this is always the case in such small messages from the black chronicle, official versions do not agree with what is being said between people.
What are the circumstances of the accidents?
According to the first results of the investigation, the French State Police Inspectorate General de la Police National, IGPN, drove a police car on Sunday shortly after 17 hours on Louise-Michel Street in the village of Villaers-le-Bel.
"The vehicle was not in the storage mode, but was on guard and ran at speeds of 40 to 50 km/h, there was also no side light shut," explains the police source.
The green motorcycle of Kawasaki's brand, "unregistered and thus without permission to drive on public communications" (read below), driven by two young people without touching, went "very fast".
"The motorcycle killed from the left side of the police car after it left the front door," said one policeman.
The test of alcohol flow in the blood carried out on the vehicle crew showed negative.
The condition of the car (expressed front door, broken front door, broken doors) testifies to the wearability of the vehicle.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (Republique de Pontoise) Marie-Thérèse de Givry responded very quickly and announced yesterday that the IGPN had entrusted itself with an investigation of "unreasonable killings and non-performance assistance to persons at risk", which is also involved in the departmental department de la sûreté publique du Val-d'Oise (the National Police Department of Val d'Oise).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor indicated that the investigation carried out by the IGPN excludes police responsibility for misconduct at this stage.
The three witnesses who were given a detailed hearing on Sunday evening, according to the official, confirmed "the police version, although the minimum engine approached him relatively quickly to the left".
Like the wind, undoubtedly caused by the earthquake, yesterday it showed that both vehicles were locked up until the police car could be stolen.
The vehicles were secured and passed by a technical expert.
Both victims were drunk yesterday.
What happened, right now?
Yesterday in Villaers-le-Bel, people quickly spread stories about the police should quickly leave the scene without giving two young people the first help.
IGPN should also, in all caution, exclude "any serious charge" in this paragraph.
"It is the most important aspect of the investigation, which requires more attention and should be very careful with it," the police source said.
The daily "Liberation" met with an obvious witness to those who followed after the accident.
One of his eyes then leads right where the accident took place.
"Now we're together with a nurse who's a nurse in the hospital, walking down to try to get them up," says this witness.
I couldn't do anything."
Then he looked at the "screaming, completely scared cop.
Two others were trying to wake up one of the young and the fourth was talking on the phone."
Faces in the face of rapidly rising tension and the certainty of the presence of young people are hopeless, were police escorts of colleagues who, inter alia, reached the spot.
According to the same witness, the rescue hit "about twenty minutes after the police leave."
They've also performed a heart massage, but it's a nightmare.
"Let no one claim that police authorities have not come to help young people.
This young man was given first aid.
The Hassics arrived right away.
For their rescue, everything was done," the prosecutor stressed.
The pressure in Pakistan is growing
On Monday, the Pakistani police urged the first demonstration from the announcement of the exceptional status of General Musharaf, two days earlier.
In Lahor, in the east of the country, about 2000 lawyers who demonstrated resistance to the measures taken under exceptional conditions were injured by a heavy flood, which, according to the witnesses, used regular force.
The last name was answered by a stone, which a few police officers were injured.
At least 350 lawyers were called.
Similar scenarios like in Karachi and Ravalpindi, where police attacked and wounded lawyers.
A few of them should have been called.
In Islamabad, the Supreme Court's lawyers called for a general hearing and announced demonstrations, resulting in about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
The access to the Supreme Court was delayed in the morning, with the aim of preventing the assembly.
Other demonstrations were to take place in Multitan (middle) and Peshawar (north west).
On Monday, a wave of support from lawmakers gathered in the political alliance Mutthahida Mailis-e-Amal, whose president "sacrificeed the population to strengthen the flowers of the judges who stood against the exceptional situation, and the resignation of those who had made an oath before Musharaf".
"Musharaf's promise will not be paid."
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is the direct target of the extraordinary measure announced on Saturday evening.
The next day, he had to state his legal appeal to the President of Musharaf in the immediate presidential elections, which took place on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, was removed and replaced.
"All we are witnesses is against the Supreme Court, against and against the Supreme Court's judgments," said the editor in The News.
Promises Parvize Musharaf that he will be led by the army and will become the civil president, "not paying" after the announcement of an exceptional status, the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem announced on Monday.
It was expected that military uniforms would be issued until 15 November when his first presidential mandate was completed.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that summer elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also returned to the country of permanent speculation, according to which the head of the army had to order the President of Musharaf's domestic prison.
More than a third of the pregnancy continues to make pregnancy unexpected
This proposal includes unwanted pregnancy (24 %) as well as misplanned or unexpected.
More than one third (36%) is still unexpected today, the study conducted by the French Institute of National d'études Demographics (Ined)- The National Institute of Demographic Studies, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Law, which was law against the anti-concept in France.
This proposal includes unwanted pregnancy (24 %) as well as misplanned or unexpected.
The various methods of anti-conceptives, which are hormonal anti-conceptions or sterilisations, still show 5% to 6% of failure, estimates Ined.
The anti-concept law only allowed better "frequency control", the Constitution states and notes that the rate of use of hormonal contraceptives in women between 20 and 44 years has grown from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight of the ten generations are well planned today.
A couple of five has even been counted for a month and if possible for a lamb that is considered to be the most acceptable annual period for the birth of a child.
Agreed repair of the space station
More than seven hours of work in the universe required astronaut Scott Parazinski and his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) to provide an excellent equipment for the spaced solar panel needed for the further scientific operation of the station.
The risk-weighted emissions to the universe, which collected records of lengths, distances from the usual modules, speeds from which the "circuit" measures were planned and the astronomers were set up to correct.
The problems appeared on Tuesday, while the astronauts from the Discovery ship set out the Harmony module, a large warship designed to install European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see frame).
This module is any plug-in application for modules-laborator.
But you need the power to save electricity.
The second task of the operation was to move a seven-dimensional module producing electricity through solar panels that were already located on the ISS in order to compete at its final location.
After moving her, the crew began to interpret the seven-metre solar panels of the module.
And there was one of the panels that appeared to be a fitting harmony, as a result of attaching the cable, damaged on the surface without a single metre.
The explanation was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts who were originally to conduct a control exit on Discovery's ship and then to fix another solar panel whose rotation system had failed were forced to pay for the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski, who was chosen to fly to the end of the robotic arm of the ship attached to the branch of the station, and carried it out.
It's one of the best "spacewalkers" of the U.S. Aviation and Space Agency (NASA).
High, static, very reverse, has a very well-designed chest and long care.
In his 46 years, this initial call was entrusted to the doctor to "oppose" a "damaged" solar panel.
After thoroughly investigating the damage, he cut off the wire and confirmed in damaged places such as "laughs".
He helped him a second spacewalker, who stayed close to the matching cameras, and also outside, the other astronauts, including Peggy Witson, the master crew.
The devices that he used, however, were covered by an insulation device to prevent electricity from being used on solar panels producing several hundred volts, found and produced astronauts on the ground floor of the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was fully disbanded and then censored his devices and returned to the inner part of the station.
Yesterday afternoon the astronauts enjoyed a half-day rest before the day when seven astronauts were returning to Discovery's ship to return to the center, as planned, to Earth.
EADS actions weaken
The EADS shares are significantly lost in the Paris storm after this company operating in the aviation and defence industry announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cover the delay of the flight A400M.
The EADS has lost 4 % and is now on the Paris Bridge at EUR 21.96.
The financial group was required to review its expected production results for 2007 due to delays in the slow procedure for the development of the A400M flight engine, which is subject to a start-up flight.
The price for the slowdown in the supplies of a military cost flight, announced in October, was estimated to be "from 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus", announced the parent company of the European EADS structure.
As a result of these costs, EADS will, on Thursday, present its quarterly results, be required to report a new view of the profit before the calculation of the rates and duties (EBIT).
The Group also found that the new cost estimate corresponds to the six-month delay.
Note that the results of EADS in 2006 fell by 86 %, particularly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, which is the year A380.
The group originally assumed that the first supply of the A400M airport would be provided by the French army in October 2009.
Decision for status quo
Sunday's elections will be held without any bitter expectations: Russia's majority will choose the side of President Putina, the United Russia.
In support of this, only a very few free-of-occupation campaigns, their withdrawals to stability, or to the authority, have been completed.
Today, three days before the elections to the parliamentary hearing, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends voters to public stations with a television message, but its content is kept secret.
This is the position of the leader of the United States of Russia, the propagandist, who, according to all, celebrates a wooden victory.
When he accepted an extension of foreign states yesterday, the president left nothing to go out of him and calmed down with another attack on the West accused of interfering - his favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy, and we are proud of what may be the most transparent and most open-hearted elections, elections without any less water for beauty," he added.
It's not like that in the eyes of the opposition.
They remove the campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennadaj Zjuganov says that "they never had such a dirty choice, not for Jelcin."
After the repressions of last week's demonstrations, former world minister Gary Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, continues to ban the visit, according to his lawyer.
"Russia remains the mental homo sovietica."
In the background of these parliamentary elections, two further open questions are being raised:
- "Who will become Putin's representative in the presidential office?
yesterday's Official Journal published the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; candidates may be represented by 23 December.
Vladimír Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot force a third term in line.
However, no trace can be found.
- "What role will Putin play after summer?"
Will he be the first?
Or the Head of Parliament and the most powerful parties of the United Kingdom, who choose the government and the president?
Whether that is the case or not, the current ruling power will win over the whole of Parliament as well as in the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"Russia remains a mental homo sovietica, not to be the master of his judgment," says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center of Levad.
Historik Nikolaj Kopossov of the State University in Sankt-Peterburg has long had far - reaching connections: civil society has gathered, in this country, the Christian five centuries after Europe, the delay; he has seen the creation of individualism.
After liberal reforms in the 1990s, "Putin referred to the state's patriarchal model, which was perfectly accepted by the citizens, rather than that new patriarchalism practiced terror, but a certain economic prosperity," is thought to be Maria Lipman from Carnegie's award.
The Russians today are "depending on personal responsibilities", which they have recently demonstrated after the SSSR collapse.
"What do you think?"
This phenomenon concerns all types of society, including the commercial world.
And the official elite is intended to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (of the total number of 85 heads of Russian regions) running the local candidates of the United Kingdom.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, sonic chaos.
Public opinion gives priority to stability.
Also, in the name of stability, Russia will not wish extremes.
The conclusion of Tamary Cheredničenko, four-partly professors: "What do you think?
Those who are in power are not so bad, so why change them?"
Loaded Memory
After more than sixty years in a reliable regime, Nazi archives from Bad Arolsen, which represent 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, are open to the public.
47 million archive documents stored within 27 km of Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were currently available only for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. individually, on the request of former victims or their eligible persons.
Nine decades of archive management - between Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
In view of the fact that the ratification process for this agreement is at the end of all States, yesterday's opening took effect.
Stimulating information
Free access to Bad Arolsen's "particularly the transfer of prisons, camps and health status to work," explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives led by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICCR).
Until recently there were several states, including Germany, against the access of these so-called public documents, due to the sensitive attitude of certain information.
What are supposed to be homosexuality or the mental achievement of some victims of deportation?
After the war, the registers of concentration camps or hostages of the Gestapo were gathered for a practical purpose to find the deported or forced work of a particular civilian population, to provide evidence of their involvement with a view to opening the way for their damage.
More than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen still face dozens of individual requests today.
However, for the part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is only limited.
"There's nothing to expect from these documents in general new," said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for the study of anti-Semitism at the Berlin Technische University.
The EU and India want to draw up free trade agreements in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between Europe and India has reached EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is the first trading partner in India and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
In 2008, the European Union and India expected the signing of a free trade agreement, announced the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian client Kamal Nath.
In the autumn of last year, the EU's Foreign Affairs Ministers gave the Green European Commission a start with the signing of a free trade agreement (agreas de libre exchange, ALE) with India, South Korea and with the Association of Southeast Asian States (Asean). Bilateral trade between Europe and India has now reached €60 billion a year.
The EU is the first trading partner in India and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, up to the ninth trading partner of the EU.
"The Free Trade Agreement has a wide range of economies" and "India has better access to the 450 million prosperous European markets," said Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported to India, the European Commissioner confirmed. The Asian and European giant, together with the annual change of "47 billion euros in goods" and "10 billion euros in services", announced this week by Daniel Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation in New Dilli, regretting that the bilateral trade "has not yet achieved its full potential". The EU and India meet on Friday at the eight joint diplomatic summit in New Dilli, in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrosy.

The English bank took on the knowledge of concerns and offered 10 billion pounds in five-week auction
On Thursday, the English bank pointed out that it was intended to reduce the current concern that the conditions on the credit market would again deteriorate and announced the 10th billion-billion-free bid in the five-week auction for a basic rate of 5,75 %, the offer would not normally be long.
"I would like to ease my concern that the conditions on the financial markets will be very unacceptable at the end of the year and give banks greater confidence in the way in which to ensure their readiness for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant share of its planned reserves during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-day operation on the open market," she said in the communiqué.
The Bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the financial market on 6 December at 12.15 GMT until 10 January for the basic rate.
It seems to be the first thing that BOE pumps on the financial market the cash flow in the five-week open market operation.
They usually last a week.
BOE adds in its communiqué that "it remains ready to take other measures to maintain inter-bank interest rates" at the same level with its basic rate.
The interbank rate was 5,829 % on average.
The three-month rate rate was 6,6 %, which is the highest since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the annual financial crisis, the sums have been placed on the financial market of the Bank of England associated with the payments made by the banks since the use of this offer.
According to some speculatively enhanced developments in the euro library course, much preferable decisions have been made for sums placed on the financial market of the European Central Bank with lower rates and more promising discrepancies.
UMP (Union per un movement popular, Union for Human Rights) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) refuse to reject socialist proposals on purchasing
The UMP and Neweau Centre refused to discuss on Thursday the various paragraphs of the socialist proposal of the Buyability Act, which is equivalent to the replacement of the text.
On the agenda of the day, the text of the proposal was delivered within the framework of the so-called socialist "neighbour" (a meeting initiated by a single sending club) and contained the 10 measures taken in the second PS Presidency, including an increase in employment premium of 50 %, a renewal of rolling stock, a transport check or a lease regulation.
In view of the fact that UMP and NC voted against the transmission of individual paragraphs (180 votes to 115), the meeting was concluded after a general debate, which was an opportunity to exchange views, sometimes more alive, between the majority and the opposition, several hours before the television appearance of Nicolase Sarkozy on the market.
The Head of the PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club would again submit these proposals in their entirety in the form of supplements to the amending proposal of the Finance Act, which would be scheduled for the next week.
A New Festival Begins
As a result of much speculation that C3 Presents in Philadelphia is establishing a new festival, this promoter/producer Vineland Festival in New Jersey announced in collaboration with the Republic of Great Britain's director Melvin Benna Festival.
"It is a privilege for our company to work with a man who inspired the current festival party in America without any hesitation," said Charlie Jones from the C3 server Billboard.com.
C3 is produced at the Chicago Festival Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland in New Jersey is an annual camp target station.
The festival should run from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres, approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic Festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most famous festival organizers.
In 1989 Cormida Reading Festival was held in the United Kingdom, which annually attracts 80,000 people.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added his portfolio to Leeds Festival, and in 2006 the Republic founded Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Starting in 2002, Melvin Benn, a partner, also at the age of production, licenses and organizational tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which currently has up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 marks the "most inspiring event" that he has ever experienced and says that his company and company Melvina are working together to give the region a festival event of European style.
"We originally chose Philadelphia as a market and worked hard together with the Fairmount Parks Commission to establish a festival in the center of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"I went with the city and the Commission was motivated and raised from the project.
Sadly, however, because of the current leadership of the city, we have turned to politics, says Charlie Jones.
"We were lucky to have the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Ben and to build a great festival in an exceptional place, which will result in serving the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents held the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 in the Czech Grant Park, after attending the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The gross market for the year 2007 amounted to $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both of these festivals are held in the city center.
"The European festival model Melvina Benna is playing outdoors while our festivals are spending more on green media in cities," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to include them in a certain way in both diets so that we can create both the taste of the foreign festival after Europe and the city after America."
Vineland is located on half the road between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"In addition to Vineland, including the elderly, it supports the implementation of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The last-named refusal to extend the terms of the agreement, however, claims that "they are good enough to allow them to invest in such events and welcome the festival that will have, hopefully, long-term duration".
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to the capacity of Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which takes 80,000 people.
He says that the group has already been sent invitations, but nothing can be confirmed at the moment the program is first given to the press.
"Vineland will have a chain of rock ceilings, music will be there, but there will be sand so we can draw a wide spectrum of monsters if possible," says Carlie Jones.
C3 partners, who received the price of Top Independent Promoter in the last year of Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal Heads of Terminals
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when it comes to setting itself a Terminator...
This certification mission is one of the tasks of the delegation.
However, his mandate is "politically convenient" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger withdraws "runaway productions".
Is it hard to put the Governors in the drawers?
"It must be careful, it's the industry who decides where it goes.
If he finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer those who will consider them the best," he said.
Festival Hundred
At this point, however, Denise Turcotte is a priority for the promotion of local film.
It's already started for Oskary.
At all Western festivals, whether about festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it's about to present Quebec films, warn them and ensure that the directors give talks.
A few weeks ago, he had a good audience at the 30th anniversary of Mill Valley Film Festival.
It will be presented at Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shakespeare's hands with the Devil is at the hotel in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th anniversary of the Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Québec also presented four short-term and four full-time films at the American Film Institute Festival.
At the end of the year on the storm to the marathon?
Less than five weeks remain at the end of the year and investors are already expecting me to reach the traditional marathon at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so sure they'll come to him.
Bank Banif is thought to be "from a statistical point of view, it is a month on a positive basis".
However, it is not appropriate to create proposals on the basis of statistics, in particular because, in the current context of the market, there are at least short-term doubts."
These experts do not assume that in the last few weeks the bursa is being removed, and they state that "the bourgeois market maintains existing liquidity, which is ready to invest in the absence of guarantees, in particular a strong income affected by the processing of quality securities, both in the long term and in the short term".
Therefore, it is thought that the burza will have a calmer transition, never without volulity, "in particular because I do not know the impact of the likely fall in the FED (Federal Reserve System), given the high level of prices of oil and the risk of inflationary pressures".
Javier Barrio, the leading sales of BPI banks in Spain, agrees that it is not the right time for a bold declaration to arrive at the marathon.
"There are not too many reasons for joy," says this expert.
Ibex lost almost 4 % of the maximum values recorded on 8 November when the index ended on 15 945.7 points.
Still, not all experts have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, analytic Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could end a year in close to 16,000 points thanks to the recapitalisation of portfolios and traditional incomes on pension insurance that is coming up every year at this time.
However, this expert indicates that this year will be a little different, since it is thought that maraton will arrive early in the second Sunday following the extended weekend on the occasion of the Day of the Constitution.
The above analysis is not likely to affect market orientation.
Federico Olucha, analytic Inverses Banco, also estimates that we are approaching technical level and "that is why we could observe the index produced by US reports on the consequences of the credit market crisis".
Analyticals believe these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on the selection of titles that are prepared to bring Ibex to new maximum codes.
Solana from Intermoney confirms that this year is a series of strong titles.
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies in portfolios, "because by the time this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha of Invers Banko, on the other hand, ensures that growth is taking place in the hands of the banking and industrial sector.
The construction companies will also be able to enjoy this maraton if it comes to it.
"ACS has been gaining position for several months now and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will go the same way," explains the expert.
cyclical consumption will be in the last part of the year in advance due to an increase in sales during the evening sales period.
On the other hand, this expert believes that technologies will also be very good, even though they are not too well represented on this field in the Spanish market.
Five times a week
In the last seven years, the Sunday was only in two months of decline.
The actual marathon was held at the end of the year 2003, in the year 2003, when the bourgeois market ended by the collapse of the technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered 28,17 %, the average increase was 6.68 %.
We'll see if 2007 will be in line with the fifth profit year (but Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if he can have his marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundreds of banks Popular will have 12 hours open from Friday to Saturday
The Bank of Popular decided to update most of its branches.
A total of two hundred located in the most prosperous parts of Spain.
These sections carried out under the label of Popular Max are a big change for the bank.
Similarly for the other Spanish entities, because it is the first group that has decided to take such a step and set up an open time period of their alternates up to 20.30 hours and open on Saturday from 10 to 20.30 hours.
BBVA, another group, who also several times made sure that he wanted to extend the opening time of his ward, had not yet decided on this step.
In the meantime, it shall enter into an agreement with the opening committees to replace 75 % of its spare parts on Saturday for the extension of the opening period by one afternoon, although not for the public.
The results of this experience of the Bank of Popular will be crucial to the involvement of other entities in this initiative that supports the opening-up period of trade, whether or not.
That's exactly the purpose of the project that popular bank has come up with.
Find individual customers who come to these places after their purchases, small and medium-sized companies, biologists and trades from selected streets, where they will come to open the shop.
The Bank wants to open 200 of these sections throughout Spain for about 18 months, because it is not about opening new sections, but only about fixing existing ones.
For this reason, the bank modernises the areas already in trade zones by adapting the customer profile in individual streets.
The extension of the opening time is complemented by another space of the side and by a new, more modern design in lighter colors.
The business manager of the bank Ángel Rivera ensures that this restructuring will not mean a large investment, but a larger number of staff, as it passes from six employees to eight to nine.
The areas will even be equipped with small and medium-sized companies meeting spaces and also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
The Popular Bank has already tested this initiative in three Madrid districts.
And it was a positive experience as explained by Ángel River.
The selection was in the Madrid streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía, and according to Rivera, it seems to have been a happy choice.
The Popular Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And the other 60 specialises on immigrants who are carried out under the Mundocredit mark also have a very long opening time and open even on Sundays and on holidays.
PopularMax sections will not follow the BBVA model when its range offers a large scale of non-financial products for sale.
"We don't want to compete with our clients," says River.
They just agreed with the telephone on mobile sales through external staff.
Telecinco first on the bridge doubled the value of its Antany 3 rival
We did it.
Yesterday, Paolo Vasile, executive President of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the conclusion of the trade when he found that the television he runs doubled the value of his Antany 3.
The only thing she said was, 'What I hate is that it didn't happen because we'd grow up more, but because we're less deaf,' he declared.
And then he stressed that thanks to the weak market, we've been under a lot less.
Telecinco concluded trade yesterday by 2,54 %.
This profit increased their loss by 15,66 % in the current part of the year.
The company's cost of the Mediaset (c. 52% capital) in Vocenta (other 13%), according to Bloomberg's data, reaches €4,488.88 million.
Her competitor Antena 3, which last night dropped by 1,52 % and dropped by 40,5 % since last winter, has a share of 2,193,46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies assessed was 3,571 billion in the case of Sogecapable, 2,518.53 million Prisa (supplier Cinco Días) and 1,779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, comparison with Antoine 3 is offered because 'we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do this on the same market, at what price and how we evaluate it in monitoring.
Telecinco announced last week that this year it is counted by the transfer of billions of gross revenue from advertising to the first television channel, as provided by Giuseppe Tringali, Executive President of Telecinco and Publicespana, which ensures the advertising of the group.
If the proposed data really were to be targeted, this television channel would indicate an increase of 3,6 % in advertising to 965.4 million in 2006.
Similarly, in the first nine months of life, the net turnover of Antony 3 increased by 1.6% (and reached 734.4 million), while the net revenue of this TV increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors for which analysts are focusing on the best relative development of Telecinco on the bridge is the increase in pay out which has so far been maintained: in 2006 this company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, divided between its shareholders 100% of its profit.
Vasile ensures that although the decision is early, this coefficient could be changed after buying 33 % of Endemol’s company together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official obligation to give at least 50%, although we have always voted much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to calm down our shareholders, whom we have already raised the value of 33% Endemol.
According to market analysts at this time, it shows a certain disadvantage.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced his profits to Telecinco, which was 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is because they explain that the projected increase in revenue from 0.5 % to 8.4 % in 2008 and from 5.5 % to 5.1 % in 2009.
The company also reduced the expected profit of Anteny 3, which was 4,5 % in 2008 and 7,5 % in 2009.
Figure 3
I'm sorry.
Ibersecurities: it recommends buying both titles primarily on the basis of increased dividend and long-term sustainable potential.
It's not like I
Caja Madrid: a value better Telecinco (hromate) than Antenu 3 (keep) due to its 'performance' and the growth of trade.
It's not like I
JPMorgan: In both cases, it recommends not to underestimate them, because they are headed by 'like threats' (a corrupt market and a damaged economic environment).
Congress approved the conversion of MiFID from 1 November to 1 November
In conjunction with Parliamentary meetings, which have been completed today by the vote of the Congress on the new members of the Senate on the proposal for a law, the government has drawn up a public hearing of the regulation which is developing the new law with a view to both entering into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of individual parties have similarly urged Members and senators to agree and agree to the best standard in order to ensure the protection of investors and the detailed regulation of the activities of entities necessary for the effective functioning of the market.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, foresees the modernisation of the financial markets and also strengthens the investor's protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Commission on the Securities Market (CNMV) and supports cooperation between the European Union's individual supervisory authorities.
This new provision will allow financial advice services to be provided by specialized companies, both natural or legal persons and will create a new type of company providing financial services (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFIs), which are associated with securities companies, intermediate offices with securities and portfolios.
In addition, the number of operating systems for financial instruments is increased so that multilateral trading systems and internalisation systems will be connected to regulated secondary markets that will compete with the current bourgeois macros.
The Law further obliges investment services companies to disseminate information on the key aspects of their commercial profile, to present risk and ways of dealing with risk and requires the reporting of all operations performed to simplify the review by CRMV.
During the session of the Congress's Trade Commission, several adjustments were included, including the fact that the secured claims were considered as a "complicated" financial instrument in view of the high risk for investors which was shown by the high risk of mortgage debt in the USA.
The revision of the Directive was further used for the legal exercise of the functions which may be held by the bankers in the field of economics and management of the company 30 years after the Royal Decree was adopted in 1977, which deals with professional functions awarded for the economy.
At the same time, the Senate has organized the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary who will work externally, will not require authorisation from CNMV and will be able to provide trade services with products and customers for different investment firms at the same time.
The Harmonised ISC increased by five decades to 4.1 % in November.
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat for the calculation of the European Union inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices have developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication corresponds to Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) policies to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator shall be calculated for the same process as used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but for the use of different methods of statistical modelling for information estimates which are not available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Statistics Institute) noted that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative, and therefore it is not necessary to comply with the final data entered in the notice of 14 December this year.
"ISC will continue to remain relatively high"
The second vice-president of the government and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes stated that the November increase in ISC to 4.1 % is "the number of temporary", but also predicted that the price index will continue to be a relatively "high level" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes in the Congress halls confirmed that "although it is not a recognised number", Spain's inflational difference against the trade union is still "more or less" in the last two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than last month when the government didn't count on such a high increase.
"We were expecting a value of around 4 %," the Minister of the Economy introduced the data submitted today.
Virginia is planning to work with Northern Rock 42 billion euros within three years
Since the time the Bank of England had received the Northern Rock in half of its time into the crisis and had to withdraw from the Bank of England's emergency loan, its savings fell by more than 50% to 12 billion pounds (16.8 billion euros).
At the time, the bank had adjusted the record in value of more than 25 billion pounds, which gradually failed to trust customers for two and a half months, even though the government had offered a percentage guarantee for this money and extended it to the end of the crisis.
Virgin company, whose name replaces the entity's commercial financial mark Virgin Money, needs to get around the quarter of the revenue invested in the British banks in the following three years, so that she can earn the remaining 18 billion pounds and achieve that goal of 30 billion.
The Group of Magnets Richard Branson, known in the United Kingdom as its ideal advertising campaigns, is planning to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing to reach its own initiative.
The Northern Rock bank this week marked the offer of the Virgin Consortium, which creates three other companies, such as the one that gives priority to saving it from bankruptcy.
Old Totany arrested for certain corrupt practices on construction
In the early hours of the day, the civilian guard kept the current age of the city of Totana (on the People's side) due to its alleged involvement in corrupt practices at the construction that was discovered this week.
Next, one of the secretary of the office and the chief of the local police was arrested.
José Martínez Andreo rewarded Juana Morales, a contemporary humane delegation and until the age of the village, which, according to the research sources of Cadena SER television, could be the "head" of the entire company.
The police continue to monitor the building of the building and the construction commission and do not release any further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer Juana Moralese, a chief suspect of corrupt practices at the construction that was discovered at the beginning of this week, was charged.
As Cadena SER informed yesterday, the lawyer of the 'human' delegation, Juana Moralese, who was verified, arrested on leaving the Morales apartment with important documents related to corruption.
In addition, according to the research sources, the subject of the study of Morales' particular selection is provided for by his signature of the construction agreement with the governing construction company, which was overqualified 200 hectares of land.
It's currently held by eight people.
Bono accepted the offer of state in front of the current PSOE candidates and, if they win, president of Congress
Former Defence Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the president of the government and the general secretary of socialist José Luise Rodríguez Zapatera to stand in the next general elections in front of the PSOE candidate letter in Toledo and in case socialists win the general elections, they became president of Congress.
So at the press conference, the PSOE secretary for the organization José Blanco and Bono himself announced this after meeting with Zapater, who spent the afternoon at the federal side of the page.
The executive chief of the former minister's offer has led to the fact that in political life, "it is important to count with those best" and Bono "is among those best".
He further noted that "yes, it seems," that this policy from La Manchy would be a candidate for the Socialist Party to the President of the Congress if the Socialists win the next elections.
As President of the Congress, Manuela Marína, who announced his decision not to apply in the next general elections and leave his active political career so that he could fight climate change in university education.
The former Minister admitted that the President of the Government had continued to urge him to return to the top policy he left two years ago.
He went on to say that just as a citizen knows who will be the Deputy Minister of the Economy if PSOE wins elections, his party wanted to announce the "transparent form" of the president of the Congress.
If Bono gets this function, he hopes that the Snow will change to "houses of respect and never demand or cry" and aims to "will be more and more like citizens".
"When he felt sorry that the only place in Madrid where he could not speak peacefully was Congress, the President of the Government in Senate had, on one occasion, cancelled 26 times."
Similarly, he brought praise to the address of current President Manuela Marina and his "good work" and did not want to represent himself in his place so that he would not be ashamed of how he indicated what his opponents might consider "the greatness."
air-conditioning
In view of the fact that the fight against climate change is cruel, both those who observe the sceptics of its proposals and those who take the lead in other political and social wars must show strong solidarity.
And there is also the leader of the campaign, which is the president of the government as Zapatero, who believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and is even able to sign "a new treaty with the planet".
This proposal encourages him to explain why the activities or inaction of his government have contributed significantly to the failure of Spain to comply with the Kyoto Protocol in the European Union.
Who is responsible for the failure in which the sector is taking place and why his government, the government of the Treaty, has not prevented it.
In addition, it encourages the Spanish to explain to themselves what measures they are willing to take in order to distort climate change.
Those companies will be affected by this, which will have to change the customs of citizens, which are energy savings, individual and collective, which we will have to accept and which will have economic consequences.
In other words, who sacrifices and who pays for saving the planet.
But we didn't expect such explanations, nor do we.
Just because it's necessary to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are not popular.
Dear, uncomfortable and threatening business and private accounts.
Even one cent from the price of gasoline, proposed by PSOE (Spanish Socialist Party), Zapatero was so risky from the view of the election that he hurried to dismiss it.
In other words, it's about saving the planet so that it's nothing, a pure propaganda, a password that makes any real meaning.
The Commission, the Committees, the Protocols and the New Posts shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with the procedure laid down in this Article.
And we make a covenant with the earth; and this is how the Lord, who is worthy of all praise, is free from all charges, and He does not require of any thing, but He is the Giver of bonds, and He raises him up.
If it's limited to being a virtual side of the contract and he doesn't want us to ride on the bike and agree to believe it.
The old and chief of Totany's local police are detained for suspicion of corrupt practices at construction
As the investigation sources were informed, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the city of Totana, "people" José Martínez Andreo, chief local police officer, secretary of the factory and one customer in the camp, for suspecting the escape of criminal acts at the construction site.
The old man was arrested in his apartment and transferred to a workshop in which he is now meeting with a number of police officers who have also brought to the Commission for the construction and urban business for industrial land and housing.
These three arrests came to six which came last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, during operations connected with over-qualification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land on the ground suitable for the establishment that the Government company Nuaria, after payment of illegal provisions during the past holiday period, could set up 4,000 homes.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested, but were charged in a short trial in the court of the first instance of Totana.
Six of the first prisoners were handed over to the court today.
According to the information sources, the former elderly Totany and today a member of the autonomous parliament for the Lido side (PP), Juan Morales, has been investigated.
His ex-wife, the owner of the real office, registered today in Totana and his contemporary friend who lives in Murcia, is also charged with the capital of the autonomous area.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of the Nuaria group, a lawyer and a businessman from Viga, was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra province), as well as Pablo José M. G., director of the company Suelo de Inmonuar, who belongs to that group and over the time the payments were made.
The investigation shall be carried out by a group of criminal offences in the construction of the operational central unit of the Civil Guard, whose members, in addition to the arrest, have also carried out eleven inspections, mostly in companies related to the arrests, with a seat in Madrid, Vigu, Murcia, Pontevevre, Las Rosas (Madrid province) and Totania.
At the time, only one person was arrested in Totany, and in the area it was a very well-known owner of the company's products from a remote mass that could serve as a mediator.
The Nuaria group was entrusted with the establishment of the largest residential complex in the city of Totany, which would represent a building of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company obtained 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which was overqualified and its project was to double the settlement of a city with 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group creates companies such as Autesa and Inomonour, which are responsible for supporting the property market, Conycase, which runs parking in Corunë, Venezuela and at Fernando el Católico in Vigo, Hogartel, which is responsible for direct marketing and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction properties.
And that's happening.
It's the first time I've ever seen.
If you're not against, we're leaving the Book of the Month, and we need other evaluations and competitions between us.
I've got something in my head already.
People, life is a change.
You can still come with ideas.
It's not like I'm here.
Our Finnish writer has sent us this comment from yesterday's issue of the most important Finnish news of Helsinki Sanomat (from the beginning of the PISA programme report on education in the world), which is calling for what the news published on 18 November, on the same day when the events and criticism of the Blackburn book appeared there:
"The content of philosophy led to public discussions in connection with tragedy at school in the city of Jokel.
The victim's voice, high school student, quoted in their accounts the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, a professor of philosophy responsible for the subject of philosophy, asked the professors of Helsinki Sanomat to take a critical opinion from Plato and claimed that it was not necessary to examine Nietzsche in the compulsory basic course of philosophy at secondary schools."
It's not like I'm here.
One colleague shall inform you of the introduction of a criminal offence from the Internet into a criminal law:
A. The holding of one song would be a criminal act with six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you break into the table at a price of less than 400 euros, it is considered to be only a break (§ 623.1).
B. If you decide to sell up to €1,000, the theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty is lower than before the arrest (section 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal the car and return it in 40 hours, the penalty is still lower than before the arrest (§ 244.1)
D. It's less important to participate in tricks than changing compacts.
The rate of participation shall be between three months and one year (section 154 of the Criminal Code) and the rate shall be between six months and two years for the exchange of compacts.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment in employment is considered under section 184.2 of the criminal law to be less serious than filming on DVD.
F. Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted films is a penalty rather than the provision of pornographic material to young people (§ 186).
So if my colleague doesn't make a mistake, someone gets his hand, and that's all right.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
My healing doctor beats me one of his articles on weird research called "Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
Or feelings that cause monthly payments to employees depend on how many colleagues they work.
The study was conducted at the University of Bonn through magnetic resonances on tomography and the results were published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernda Weber, author of the study and leading group Views of Life&Brain's nervous system in Germany: "The biggest activity came when the research participant responded correctly and his colleague mistakenly."
The researchers noted that if both were successful, they received the same pay, the activation was mild, but when one got double, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much knowledge.
Balkans complaints
For eight years Carla del Ponte has been closely following the State Prosecutor's Office of the Court of Justice in Haagu of the Balkan War.
Its mandate will be extended by the end of the year and Carla will go away with mixed feelings, because the main perpetrators of the massacre in Srebrenica, where 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzič, are still free.
Their names are on the list from which Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach's documentary film "Karlin List" (2006, not known in Spain), who, at the time of the Detective Triller's visit from Belgrade to New York, was a Swiss complaint to monitor the alleged crimes and pressure on the States concerned to attack the network.
What insurance is appropriate for me?
Car insurance that protects the driver in the event of an accident. It represents a significant expenditure that depends on different factors such as age, status, sex, duration of driving order, type of vehicle to be secured or used, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing a suitable car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to explain what we're talking about.
Vehicle insurance is an agreement between the insurance and the insurance undertaking.
This commitment takes the form of an insurance contract, which provides that the insurance will receive an agreed security amount at a certain level in order to take into account the age of payment damage in the event of an accident.
The insurance price shall be determined in respect of different factors, such as age, status, sex, duration of the driving licence, type of vehicle to be secured or used, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so the higher the likelihood of accidents, the higher the security rate.
For this reason, both women and persons aged 25 must pay less insurance, as statistics show that they have lower risk index in view of their caution.
In the same way, on the basis of controls, insurance companies have concluded that those living in marriage are less dangerous than free drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will have an impact on the frequency of driving and on the likelihood of having an accident.
The increase in driving speed increases the likelihood.
It's a lot of variables that insurance is considered to be the price of insurance.
Therefore, the driver must study the situation carefully so that he can accept the insurance that is best in line with his insurance profile.
We will show here the most important change to choose whether or not the type of insurance, which will be also of a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 50 meet with various disadvantages, such as little experience with management and short holding of the driver’s license if they want to sit at a safe price available.
Although the ideal for good cover is insurance against all risks, there are even cheaper options.
The most prudent drivers can choose insurance against all risks with low security so that they can obtain safe coverage of all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would predict the involvement of a client in the award of a certain event.
"The share of the security benefits that a client will receive in advance when determining the price of the security, which will be higher, the eye would be lower to participate," explains Luis Noguera, head of First Europe in Spain, the Internet insurance intermediary.
Another option is insurance extended to other participants so that the client will take care of the damage caused by other persons, but not damage to his own car.
In addition, it would be secured against theft, fire and destruction of vehicles.
Recommendations.
If you are younger than twenty-five years old, try to be careful and avoid danger as soon as possible, because it affects your bonus and will allow you to reduce the certainty of the future.
Bonus is a reduction of the basic rates that the insurance company has.
On the contrary, small increases are the basic rates mentioned.
"Bonus and the little ones will depend on insurance and her profit.
If she had a good insurance year, she'd be able to afford to raise the bonus," explains Noguera.
After crossing the border for twenty-five years, drivers have a harder time when they are going to sit in insurance because the customer's risk index reduces them due to the experience they have acquired.
For this reason, it is recommended that all risks insurance should be met at a low level.
"Young people can usually not take advantage of the experience they have gained when they come to the disaster, and even when they are in management," the director of the European company in Spain assures them that most accidents occur in the second year when they have been overcome by the "fear of the novelty".
However, if the client is married, but has no children yet, it is better to sit down to insurance against all risks if that still allows his economic situation.
Families with children are considered insurance as a customer with the lowest risk index and therefore their symptoms will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with low insurance (which could be made up of 300 euros) or at a high bonus, insurance extended to other operators starting in the third year from the purchase of the vehicle.
"Their management is calmer and their purchasing capacity is higher, so they can afford to get the highest score here," says Luis Noguera.
In the event of a high bonus, it is recommended that the beneficiaries be advised to ensure a low level of insurance (which amounts to EUR 150) or insurance extended to other operators.
It should be said that car insurance is something important not only because protecting drivers in the event of accidents but also because it represents a significant expenditure, which is a good reason for peer learning the possibility of insurance, which would be most important to us in view of our personal situation.
Celtic is trying to get to AC Millán, which means eightfinal
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their strengths this afternoon at San Siro Stadium in an effort to get a point that they miss to achieve their respective goals in the end of the "Champions" league, because for Italy it would be the first and in Scotland it would decide to take place.
The Italians have ten points and have already made their way in the fifth restricted stock in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but he needs another one to make sure that the chess won't get six points to play with Benfiko, which has four.
These two games of group D will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, because AC Milan has to play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where the first three in the semi-final is to be able to fit into the finish playing the sixteenth.
So this group will be closed sooner than the rest and undisputed result at the Giuseppe Meazzy Stadium seems to be most likely, even though both men are trying to win because Italy will not want to act on the home floor and Celtic knows that after the win it would be the first and ensure a better place in the eight finals.
Gordon Strachan's husband could even become a loser if chess doesn't win, but he can't rely on it because at the same number of nine points the Ukrainians who lost last week in Glasgow (2:1) but won in the first direct escape (2:0).
And so the AC Milan players try to beat the night Scotts who believe that the subterraneans will get to the semi-finals in the reorganised Champions League just like they were wounded in the same race in the previous competition in the Kaka field in the extension (1:0) after the position 0:0 in the basic game time.
Hope that they win the "rossoneri" will be the chess for which the prize of victory is worth only if Celtic has won, and it's both for the eight-year-old process and for the maintenance of UEFA.
Benfia, although it is the last and has no opportunity to continue in the highest European competition, could reach a third place by one win, so she would play in UEFA.
The first concert in the Spice Girls tournament took place in Vancouver
The Spice Girls group started in Vancouver, Canada, before 20,000 monsters its first tournament since it broke out in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) soon before they started their concert at the GM Place Stadium in Vancouver, they declared that their group's reunification is "great".
About 20,000 people bought tickets to be present for a concert that included videos that included the stories of this group that resulted in a sensation at the end of the 1990s.
Returns and world tournaments are played at the same time when they have a new album released by the EMI in Spain, which brings their main success stocks, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five Spice Girls appeared on a yellow-haired tape that their husband gave them "Push Spice", British footballist David Beckham.
This athlete was in the audience that was sailing through GM Place, although the nervous Victoria banned him a few days ago.
Before the start of the presentation, Victoria Beckham said about the British star that "he didn't even see our costumes, so I'm nervous about what he thinks about the presentation."
"Sporty Spice," whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of differences between us" caused two years later the release of the fifth group, also released its nervous system at a meeting with the journalist two hours before the start of the presentation.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world's public opinion had changed, the view of Spice Girls changed.
And I thought, "Why not, so I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said about the reunification of a group she left nine years ago.
The singer also noted that in time, things were "dangerous and we're all very happy".
However, many things have changed since Spice Girls was finally released together in 1998.
So at the beginning, according to CTV, the team flew into Vancouver by Virginia Airlines.
At the airport, she was waiting for an army of sheep.
Five of them have 7 children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the group will be held in California (USA), San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
It's going to be in Madrid on December 23.
Warnings from the new wave between Russia and Ukraine
Between Russia and Ukraine, there is a debate on the price of land oil, and thus the risk of the Russian supply of this fuel to Western Europe is increased.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is being tested through Ukraine and any dispute between these two countries is closely monitored.
Kyev warned that if Moscow raises the prices of gas in Ukraine, Russia will take into account higher transit charges.
The dispute between these two previous years has reduced supply to the EU.
The most recent dispute between Kyev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state have its own gas monopoly, Gazprom, trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for the Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says Ukraine will have to account for more, as it agreed to pay up to 50% more than the electricity it receives from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from the Gaza Strip.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations," said the Reuters agency, Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly China.
"The changes in gas prices should certainly be linked to our arguments concerning the higher transit charges (to Western Europe) across Ukraine."
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev led to a reduction in supply from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This led to a wooden export to Western Europe, which soon increased prices.
The Russian oil represents one quarter of the supply to the European Union.
Russia has the world's largest gas resources, but most of them remain insufficiently used.
As a result, Gazprom adds its own supplies with oil from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS "must control foreign employees"
The Controller said that the NHS Chambers must improve the control of criminal registers in non-European employees.
The recommendation from the president of the highest control agency Robert Black came after the foreign doctor operating in Scotland was linked to a red attack on the Glasgow airport.
Mr Black is also afraid that the Scottish NHS does not have a precise representation of the number of foreign staff employed.
But his report stressed that the other key controls were carried out in order to imitate five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Control Authority was concerned immediately after the red attacks on the Glasgow airport on personnel received from the country outside the European Economic Area.
Eight-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone hired Jeepem into the main terminal door.
He was one of the three doctors who appeared in the Central Criminal Court on the basis of video-moving charges of being subjected to bombing tests in Great Britain.
NHS is expected to control foreign staff in regard to qualifications, experience and authorisation for work in Great Britain before their employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commission uses Disclosure Scotland to control criminal registers, this agency has no right to obtain such information outside Britain.
The report of the President of the Supreme Control Authority says, in addition to other recommendations, that the Commission should be allowed to bring the Criminal Records Bureau guidelines, which will help staff with controls in several countries.
"Since we have found that part of the staff records contained evidence of these controls, they are not carried out regularly," the report reported.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish NHS agreed in many ways with its own trans-employer policy, but he also added: "Our report alerts us to areas in which the system could be improved in order to ensure the availability of accurate information on the number of foreign staff."
The president of BMA Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry, said that it is "very unlikely" that employee controls would identify potential NHS employees who could in the future pursue terrorist acts.
"The report indicates that current trans-employer controls in the Scottish NHS are working well and it is not clear what other value these comments bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities reported that there are currently 1,161 foreign workers, most of whom are doctors and sisters.
However, the President of the Supreme Control Authority warned that these figures would probably also be higher because the Commission had a problem identifying staff with residence permit.
The study also found that the control procedures carried out by NHS authorities in the areas of Ayrshire and Aran, Grampian, Greater Glasgov and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lotian have been implemented to a great extent.
They included passport controls, labour permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently processing the policy and guidelines of trans-employer control for foreign NHS workers.
The Ministry of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "I wanted to do this work immediately after the terrorist attack on the Glasgow airport."
It also added that the Scottish Government, in accordance with the health commissions, will consider the recommendation of this report and ensure that the best procedures are made available in the updated guidelines for the supervision of all staff, including foreign staff, which plans to be issued next month.
Joy Division controlled film prices
Control, a biography film about the original song by Joy Division Ian Curtis, collected five prices at the British Independent Film Awards, including prices for the best film.
Prices were also obtained by the star Sam Riley, who worked at the Curtis office, director Anton Corbin, and next to Toby Kebell.
Lady Judy Dench was named the best hero for the triller Scandals.
And the band star Daniel Craig won the Variety award for getting a British film on the world scene.
Prices were celebrated in the London Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis's trip to honor with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This red film - its soundtrack contains The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - has been a total of 3 million free.
But he got Dutch photographer Corbin, formerly known as U2 Joshua Tree's iconic box, two prices - for the best regime and for the best beginner.
Rock music was the focus of another rating - because Julien Temple's film about the singer Clash Joe Strummer got the price for the best document.
Viggo Mortensen won the prize for the best priest's prize for the role of the Russian Mafian Boss driver in the London Triller David Cronenberg Eastern Approach.
Ray Winston, who has a reputation based on the roles of tough men, has won Richard Harris a prize for the extraordinary contribution of the British film.
This teenager, whose films include, for example, Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming another part of Indiana Jones - the Kingdom of Christian lips.
Winston said he was proud of this price, which is named after the stars of Camelot and Harry Potter Harris who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened doors for people like me," he added.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, the great hero of his time, I'm very honored."
Independent film prices, known as Biffy, are made by a jury in which filmmakers, priests and organizers attend the festival.
Between the station and the boss Bif is Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Sea Syalov and Michael Winterbotto.
Saudi Arabia arrested 208 people for terrorist harassment
Last night, Saudi Arabia announced that 208 soldiers were arrested because of their membership in the cells preparing for an immediate attack on the armory and also on the spiritual and security components.
The state television of the largest oil exporter reported that one of the banks wanted to land rockets.
Sympathizers al-Káidy led the campaign against monarchy, the United States' allies, from 2003, and from invasion to Iraq.
The television reporter reported that eight soldiers led by a stranger were planning an attack on a robin device in Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia will provide an urgent response to the 35,000 members on the defense of an undisputed attack on al-Qaida on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiqu in 2006.
The report quoted the Ministry's internal statement: 18 arrests belonged to the Bundes of the so-called "expert on rocket detonation", which had broken into the country.
It went on to say that the military were planning to destroy the kingdom by eight bullets.
22 prisoners were to prepare for the murder of spiritual and safety workers.
The government has made further efforts to prevent the Saudis from returning to Iraq to join the Al-Qaedian soldiers fighting the associated forces and the supported government of the United States, which the Conservative Sunsets of Saudis consider to be the Kazars.
The Al-Qaedish militants are thought to have bought many religious offices in South Arabia to support the royal family that governs the government.
Militanti - supporting the challenges of leader al-Káidy Saúda We use bin Ládin to focus on the Western Saudi government - focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy equipment.
"This war was a huge effort of security forces in the past... five months," state television said the Ministry's inner speech.
There was also a 16-member "median bunk" in Medina, which was intended to promote "takfirical thinking" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which supports violence against Muslims marked as unbelievers and apostates.
Among the prisoners were 32 accused of providing financial support to the military.
The climate in Venice is probably looking at the future of the Earth
Yesterday the scientists announced that Venus could sometimes be a pleasant place to live.
Data from the driving European stations show that the planet is even more similar to the beautiful two-year Earth before it was thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
These two worlds are just as big and they walk after the same dear ones, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago there were conditions similar to those on Earth and could also be civilized.
But the combined greenhouse effect caused by oxydium-depleting, atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and lower rotation speed sent Venus on a completely different path of development.
Today, the planet is without water, the temperature on the surface is pretty hot on the ceiling of the waves and lets it wind and wind with the strength of the hurricane.
The findings of the European Space Agency Venus Express, which studied the planet for one year, offer a balanced view of how the Earth could be affected by catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of Oxford University physics and one of Venus Express's leading missions said: "It's still clearer why the climate in Venice is so different from Earth, although the planet itself is quite different.
"Our new data enables you to set up a scenario in which Venus began the same way as Earth, perhaps with the civilized environment, billions of years ago."
The police kept the "failed uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently contaminated uranium, was detained by the Slovenian and Hungarian police yesterday.
The police officers said three people were arrested and the material was searched.
He did not claim that it was an uranus, but he said that this substance could be sold for $1 million (480,000 free).
Still Completed
Mitt Romney said that for presidential candidates it is not appropriate to answer questions from snowflakes.
Even so, the Republican presidential candidates subsequently agreed with the YouTube debate, in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on the video and transmitted them to sent candidates.
None of the questions raised in mid-November 28 were as comical as a snowflake who asked Democrats about global warming in the debate on the other side of YouTube.
But the questions and answers have now reflected a lot about the status of the Republican Party, which is headed for elections in the coming year.
It is not clear exactly how the CNN producers, one of the sponsors of the debate, chose the clips that were then directed to the apiary candidates.
But the first half of the debate, the longest time devoted to the one theme, was focused on immigration.
This theme is one of the strongest Republican topics.
The CNN requested a panel of unsolved voters to surround the audience when they heard something comforting: the voter noted the tops of the agreement when the candidates spoke of a strong approach to the borders.
The firmest and most important exchange of views took place between Rudy Giulian, the main national candidate, and Mr Romney, who was excommunicated in key rapid votes in Iowja and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to find a hundred stories of a man who was a prime minister of New York soft on an illegal passenger.
He challenged Mr. Romney, accusing the former government of Massachusetts of hireing illegal immigrants to work at his home.
In particular, the two were particularly proud when the graduates asked whether any of the candidates supported the "amnesty" (to give illegal immigrants the normal position and opportunity of the population).
Other candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Congressman, have been able to come up with a little bit of money on this subject.
None of these two have a chance to nominate, but they're both probably staying in the game because they're getting scared of immigration earlier and stronger than the others.
At least on arrival candidates have the same opinion: greater presence at borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, coupled with concerns about gambling from China and other ages with the surrounding world, helps the Republicans forget or minimize the gap between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate began to be very unpleasant when it came to other topics.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he supported the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney were discussing whether the simulation heating technique should be considered torture.
One teacher asked if the candidates believed every word from the Bible.
As a result, Mr. Giuliani came to the conclusion that although the Bible is his favorite book, he probably does not believe the story of Jonah and the virgin.
Another tax collector wondered if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now against all assumptions at the first place in a recent study in Iowä thanks to his long-term Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty is unacceptable but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, Jesus said that he was too wise to apply for what he used to do.
The room is usually open.
Mr. Huckabee's experience in Iové is covered by recent success in making money and the happy voice of Ron Paul in the middle of the debate.
The two of them turned out from the bottom, because both sides could not still agree on more prominent and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates joined the party very quickly and confidently with a victory message about the American size on the lines, marking both sides.
This time, the side is split and the result is far away.
Laborist Diseases
Gordon Brown again found a trap to which he could fall; his way out remains the same.
Although it's in British political scandals, it's not particularly pranky.
There seems to be no rules sold, no accounts in the Paris hotel have been paid fairly, no extra manganese fingerprints have been paid.
But the sealed Gordon Brown would be able to make it clear that some wealthy businessman, after four years, masked the contributions of the ruling Labour Party in excess of $650,000 (1.3 million) on behalf of others, and that the party did not report.
Two months ago, when the prime minister refused to vote and threatened the British intelligence by claiming that this decision had not been affected by research, there was hope that the government would ensure a peaceful and effective solution.
Instead of expressing it as he further made a more enthusiastic representative of the Liberal Democrats, once the feared Mr. Brown changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unencumbered rescue of the problem bank of Northern Rock showed weaknesses in the management and the cable judgment under the pallet.
Badly planned proposals for a change of tax law have been brought together by companies against the government.
The loss of personal data by 25 million people has left unrepresentable administrative neglect.
The three generals of the pensions started opposition in the Lord's sleep; they protested against the massacres in military spending, claiming that being the leader of the armed forces is a part of the work.
Now there are many monthly gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, a general labist (and their former internal discipline monitor), has already rejected.
It doesn't mean that Mr. Brown would go straight to his end.
In spite of this, governments can reach a point of overcrowding that is being pursued by a difficult government.
People don't believe in politics and they don't like it, but most people don't believe it when we get a new party.
Once it seems clear that a prime minister is probably not doing anything better and must not be in the office for a long time, this is being withdrawn: the government is becoming a hero, the ministers are starting to do briefing, the press is looking for bad news, and the government is becoming uninterrupted and defensive.
In one direction, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because he cannot take the position of other political leaders at the new cost.
As far as he'd like to get away from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, problems with Northern Rock and financial authority records are linked to decisions made by Mr Brown as Minister of Finance.
And even though he was not directly involved in the blairovska smallies, for example, long-term research on financing of political parties caused by "money worth", voters can easily assume that he was.
Still, Mr. Brown's hate isn't as bad as they seem.
These concepts are not as sharp as the conservatives do.
As for Mr. Bean, no one has died or been charged.
And the treatment, no matter how painful it may be, is to provide what Mr Brown's Stalinist tendencies have always promised: reliable, firm and easy for the brutal government.
The latest solution around political gifts is a good example.
Mr. Garboids, who compares his gifts with charity, says that he did not ask for his favor any publicity.
That may be true, but the decision was not on him.
The laws against the anonymity of large political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who could buy access to those in the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abraham's procedure, but didn't know that he was illegal, will certainly be reasonably heard; likewise, Jon Mendlesohn, the main labist treasurer who learned about eight gifts in October.
But Mr Brown is not yet involved; there is nothing to indicate that he knew of these wars, even though the main part of the payment went through until after his arrival in June.
The Prime Minister has already done half the work.
He quickly condemned this violation of the laws to his own side, but resolved his decision by sending him to a certified instrument, the commissions to investigate this matter - they are also led by the bishop in the debt and the judge.
In this case, education is not complex.
If the law has been violated, it's a matter of police concern.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent independent committee on Standards in Public Life, which has no more than six months to do with the actual reform of the financing of political parties.
This would require the labs who are in difficulty to cooperate with the conservators and may even have given up their special financial relationship with the committees - hot pills for the party that Mr Brown has given.
But he should face a few simple facts.
Conservatives now have a listening ear; he is two years old to get back the volleyballs; and the only way to express victory is unhindered integrity and high competence.
Cartoons
Does the crisis affect the subsidized mortgage of the US credit card market?
When blood is in the water, naturally it begins to flow around the surface.
Now that the US market with property is cold, donors are focused on the darkest credit card market.
Goldman Sachs' analysts say that losses on credit cards would be incurred if other consumer credit variants were forced from underlying mortgages, could reach $99 billion.
The pressure signals are clear.
An increase in the number of non-payment cases (with more than 30-day delay) and cancelled accounts (accounts considered by the provider to be undistributable).
The HSBC bank reported last month that the US consumer credit market lost 1.4 billion dollars - also due to non-solvency loans on credit cards.
It's still too early to panic.
The disbursed accounts and the inability to pay are still small.
According to Moody's assessment agency, 3,89% of the rate of payment in the third quarter was approximately the total percentage point under average.
Absorbing measures can be partially explained for technical reasons.
The change in the US personal bankruptcy laws of 2005 led to a sudden decrease in the number of reported banknotes that make a large part of the loss of credit cards; the number of declarations (and thus the number of copies) would therefore be based on the failure of the general conditions for the lenders.
The company also shows a good balance of payments, which shows how many consumers per month pay their debts.
And the confidence in the valuable paper of secured credit cards is strong, even through a parallel in other structured finance chains.
Mr Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup's research company predicts that their emissions for 2007 will be 25 % higher than the current.
The direct route to spread infection between the crisis of underlying mortgages and the credit card market is crucial: when loans are paid to change property, consumers are more likely to be charged with credit cards.
Credit card issuers are increasingly looking at the cash flow rather than the value of hand items, so the falling prices of the home do not necessarily mean a change in the reliability of the lenders.
They can even be useful to the lenders.
The incentive of consumers to pay mortgages is high when the value of their property is lower than the value of the loan; as a result, the debt on the cards is raised on the list of priorities for payment.
The issuing card will also be able to respond faster and more flexible to the hotter conditions than the provider’s mortgage by changing the interest rate or duty limit.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid changes in the price of handicraft items.
"It won't be possible for us to spend all the money on one beautiful morning," says Gary Perlin, the financial manager of Capital One.
Although the risk of exposure in the style of underlying hypotheses is low, the risk of progressive deterioration is far more real.
If the lower price of home and debt reduction in America push America into recession, the credit card sector will be facing a darker future.
Watch those red waters.
British bankers admitted guilty in the case of Enron
The three British bankers who were to be bound for their role in the dispute associated with former financial leader Enron Andrewe Fastowe, changed their charges in the middle and admitted their guilt.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally guilty of seven fraud charges, when they were to share with Fastow in 2000 in the financial fraud -- they had to rely on the account of their employees -- they were wrong.
They had to stand before the court in January.
However, during the trial before U.S. District Judge Ewinge Werlen Jr., each admitted to one argument.
The case of these three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, members of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, has been described on previous pages throughout the two years that have lasted the issuing operation.
In the United States, their case is one of the unclosed part of the investigation initiated after Enron’s fall in 2001.
The charges brought against him in 2002 warned Mr Fastow that he was intended to investigate the land of Enron.
The complaint against the bankers -- who served as the preview of "NatWest Three" -- claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to re-establish the dispute with Fastow and his former chief deputy Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in Enron's partner area controlled by Fastowe, who was the architect of many Enron's subversives who spent Enron's power supplying the banknote.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank assessed its share in this section zero, but our three Britons knew that it had a significant value in fact.
The Kopper Control Company purchased the bank's share of this loan of $1 million.
Incriminating banks paid Kopper a share of $250,000 in this company.
According to Fastow's complaint, Enron falsely informed the energy company that it would pay for its share in this part of Greenwich NatWest.
All those 20 million actually went to those British bankers, Fastows and others.
Bankers received 7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper, and others improved for $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow admitted wine in two cases for his role in Enron's redundancy.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving six-year sentence in the federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is in the execution of three years and one month in the facility in Texas.
All three Brits moved to freedom at $1 billion, which they were ordered to remain in the United States for the trial.
Enron, once the seven largest companies in the country, settled in the banknote in December 2001, after which it was no longer possible to hide billions of debts or to show a growing speculation as a profit.
The collapse has broken thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
Founder of Enron Kenneth Lay and former chief executive officer Jeffrey Skilling have been sentenced last year for their role in the fall of the company.
Schilling is performing more than four-year sentence.
The charges against Layem were dropped after his death on heart disease last year.
Moscow’s Inadequacies
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel for nonstop flights from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, it's still small on return.
"He can bring up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of the Gulfstream.
"But none of them is interested in such a place, because it's for the sake of the family or the company president."
Mr. Firer was sitting in the Gulfstream station last Friday at the Millionaire Exhibition, which is a four-day consumer organ in a mammoth exhibition center on the main city perimeter.
In addition to the Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury suppliers, who hoped that the freshly rich Russians would find everything from the mahogany of diamonded jackets that would be worn over into a car, which would not be worth 50 cent.
Mr. Firer looked carefully after the orange Porsche in the next scene.
"It's a nice car, but it's five and ten against us," he said.
"In the United States, Russia is the second largest private airport market in Russia."
On the streets of the capital of Russia, the money will be collected just as if it had its days Dallas.
"We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans were heavily rich and went to Europe where they looked like materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year-old listener at the centre of Russian and Eurosian studies in Harvard.
Just like the sunsets of the 70s and the Japanese in the 1990s, Russia is becoming the most prominent of the world's wastes.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for this clone of theirs.
In another place in Moscow this week, the conference of the luxury industry Donatallu Versace, Tom Forda and Bernarda Arnaulta, the president of the LVMH Group, took place in order to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods on markets, such as the Russian.
(The Conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
Russia has a list of the richest people of Forbes magazine 53 billion with a total of $282 billion.
The local institution in the Center for Economic and Financial Research also issued a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103 000 "secondary" million people in Russia whose assets amount to $670 billion.
(The World Bank states that in 2005 the Russians lived 15,8 % under the limits of the existing minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of the London colony of David Morris.
She was at the store for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewlery Group.
"All women are completely organized, and men are every change."
When they spent the evenings in the evenings on Sunday evenings, Evgenia Yumatov, and five years old Lightlan Turovc's herself and their clients, marked themselves and their clients for millions.
"I looked at this car and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Ms. Yumatov, who was wearing a brand-new dress as a veteran of red copper, following which Joan Rivers seems to be a housewife.
Veletrh seemed to be focused primarily on pure treasurers, markedly controlled Russian buyers who are willing to sit for several hours in the railway drive so that they can walk through the warehouse that is circling around Cadillacy Escalade, platinum fish, Mvöenpick Sea, Christmas table for peace, apartments in Dubai, Gund and the hall.
Members of the public could buy revenue of EUR 30 ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in what the sign is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically acquired the estate of the Dutch producer of the Royal Delft porcelain before reproducing Rembrandt's image from hand-made blue casket into a superabundance.
"Of course the Russians are more interested in gold."
And the fact that today's salesmen say that the Russians with old money (according to Russian estimates is 10 to 15 years old) have already moved from blizzard logs to a little known limited editions that would never show up on the shopping cart.
Even a few thousand people, whether they're millions of people, millions of people, or just tourists, the day that the bus stop was flying.
And some of them bought it.
On the first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershaw, the local general manager of King Koil's post, announced that he sold two matracs seeds of hat, cheese and cotton, torn with gold nitrites, after $70,000.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, the sales manager of A1 Moto, who manufactures a high-end car with high-end alarms, said his company sold a clear orange Porsche for $170,000 for Russian million.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, who, at his request, manages a luxury car, announced that he sold three lines into a car in the style of adjoining wheelchairs for Rolls-Royce Phantomy for $55,000.
He showed the reporters a car bike designed for the Russian casino owner, who had an explosion of Swarovski crystals so it looked like a roller.
Price: $22,000 for four of these.
"This Russian millionaire who wants a car from the skin or a portrait of his wife from the cross-circumcision, must not ride on these wheels yet," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He puts them in his garage from thirty to forty cars."
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr Carpetian said that the term "Russian millionaire" at present means nothing very exclusive, given the large increase in the prices of the larger properties.
"If you bought three or four years ago in Moscow, you're probably already millions, at least on paper when you're not ready," he said.
"It's more than you think."
Those who are not millions could at least presuppose wealth in the estate of the Russian Company Alliance Continental, which is in favour of active management.
The company drew up four red phone booths of the British-style column of counterfeit banknotes worth millions of dollars.
Asad Karryev, the marketing manager of the company, announced that his team had issued 500,000 counterfeit banknotes for the Great Millionaires.
Collegiants stopped to spread money around a collection of money, or let friends out of their cell phone, as they rest in the middle of their retirement wealth, or just popping up a couple of millions.
"You know, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Death in New Jersey may be caused by an operation
It was the day before the festival Thank you when Roland Livingston looked out of the big eyes of the restaurant about something healthy and watched a sanitizer who came to a white New England house with two houses than after West Scott Avenue.
A police guard's car soon joined.
And then again.
"Then I saw how the court doctor's delivery came," said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant controller.
"I knew at the time that someone died."
The authorities learned that the dead woman Olga Arroya, 41, was an executive assistant to the head of the non-war police department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether she died due to the procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity the police refused to provide who worked at the house number 212 at West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet found out what caused Miss Arroy's death, and they hope that toxicological tests, which do not have to be known for weeks, will help to solve the sudden death that the Norwegian police have sent out a wave of grief.
Ms. Arroy has been assistant police officer, Gary F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"It was loyal, maintained and worked hard," said Mr. McCarthy about Miss Arroy's phone interview in the middle.
"It was my protection.
She'd protect me."
Mr McCarthy said that Ms. Arroy was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former non-warnian police officer who worked for the Commission on the control of alcoholic beverages, and that she left two sons at 14 and 11 years of age and had no daughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for the Union's national representative, Theodore J. Romankov, said that the detective was trying to find out whether Miss Arroy died of an unlicensed surgical operation.
"It's one of the options," said Mrs. Walsh.
"The investigation is still underway."
The authorities indicated that the noise had reached home at three o'clock in the afternoon.
November and they found Miss Arroy on the stairs.
She was reported dead on site.
More than a week later, the authorities continued to say little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is evidently Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh didn't say if Mrs. Castro's offices were heard.
The investigators are trying to determine whether the part of the house is used as an organisation.
In the middle of Miss Castro's house, with a broken rose in the front yard and a Dalmatian running behind, no one answered.
According to the door that led to the lock, the blue barl in the open garage with the letter "Ethyl Vanillin" - which is a substance used as a substitute for the vanilica in food and cosmetics.
On one side, there were two high-cars on one side.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived 25 years ago in New York Police Department to Newark, Ms. Arroy provided him with invaluable help in examining his new city's rude and harsh political culture.
"She said, 'You should pay attention to this or this,' he said.
"She was always here when I came, and she was always here when I left.
It was boring."
Hopes Fed reduces interest rates, leads to the strengthening of world burgeoning
The price of the shares on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday increased after the market hopes that the Federal Bank will try to ease the loan conditions by further lowering the rates, it was strengthened by the satisfactory results of the US Central Bank's vice president.
Burys landed in London, New York, and above Europe after Donald Kohn, second in line with Ben Bernank, President of the Federation, said that in response to continued pressure on financial markets, the leaders must be "flexible and pragmatic".
As part of the apparent effort to calm down the underlying market, Mr Kohn said that recent developments "participated some improvements in the functioning of the markets by the end of September and October".
He further pointed out that if increased instability persists, the possibility of a further deterioration in the financial conditions of the home and company will be increased.
Investors consider these products to be a signal that Fed is ready to add to the US market further net capital doses, and perhaps further lower rates to stabilise credit conditions.
These notes also helped calm Wall Street among other bad reports about the American economy when the sale of apartments in October showed a record of low numbers.
As a result of the financial loan, the investment bank Bear Stearns reported that it would reduce 650 jobs, which are 4% of its world labour force, in order to reduce costs due to the compensation of the heavy losses caused by the failure to provide sub-lease loans in America.
It is expected that only 20 of these sites will be destroyed in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, industrial index Dow Jones increased by 331 points, or by 2,55 per cent, and ended by 13,289.40, while more used index S&P 500 increased by 2,65 per cent.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 per cent, and ended at 6,306.2, while the value of British blue chips increased by more than 39 billion pounds.
The German Dax index grew by 2.6 per cent and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 per cent.
A few years ago, credit pressure on the markets was shown in full force after the European Central Bank’s three-month auction of cash packages was awarded to European commercial banks at a rate of 4,7 %, which is the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow up on Fed and the ECB and release on the London cash market over standard money increased by 6.59 per cent after the uninterrupted increase from 12 November to the maximum since the end of September.
England has to decide: Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopar?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as hard as the other.
Who's going to be number six in England this weekend in Candy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopar?
And in the broader context of nothing more relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who has to make this decision?
The second question is that David Graveney, the president of the committee's selection committee, who will be better held at this time, has Peter Moores, the chief coach, and Michael Waughan, the captain, with the help of the decision and because the board of Hugh Morris, the head of the English team, is starting to fill out applications after the national election, so that they do not need to be taken into account.
The one who doesn't stand in the sixth place at the palace will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport is not at all.
It is not easy to find what one will get at the top of his profession, while another will never get over a lower level, sometimes because of a lack of happiness rather than ability.
Not only is the choice of cricket and requires a trial which must always be subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopar to move up?
Is it fair against Shaw, if any?
At the same time, we could ask ourselves, in another area, to say that here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young leaders with good education and a look at the field, should be raised to the Commission - instead of just one.
Who's supposed to say what level is right for cricketers if he's not allowed to swim or swim on the other side?
They are inspired by numbers of decisions, but they also have opportunities.
In the team, the cricket must capture the captain's view at the right time if he has to take a wicket, and the pilot needs a regular chance at starting positions, if he ever has to make a home as a single cricket.
Covering the selection view is more complicated.
For example, in the late summer season there was much better than James Anderson, whose place in the first test seems to be certain, even though Stephen Harmison was known for his health and endurance as a volunteer.
Anderson took 32 weeks in the first class at 33 on each of them.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same low level, but they both had their time at the highest level and hoped in another.
If he's playing at the Asgiriya Shah stadium, or Bopara can be just an idea.
Volba can grow or get both careers, or it doesn't have to have a big effect either.
Four years ago at Lance, Gareth Batty played in each test and in the first class performed well, five weeks and 40 permits, but it was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time fought his place, who eventually became a stable Test Cricket, which is more than that, although in Australia he recorded two hundred points, perhaps still underestimated.
It is more likely that after another discussion in the presence of today's coach, Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, they will follow their conservative instincts and give Sha's greater experience before Bopar's youth rebellion.
There are arguments for both.
Shaha speaks of his sharp and valuable debutive test shifts at 88 points in Bombaji and 32 percent in the first grade of six Boparovs, who is, in his 20s, seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spinal upwards.
However, Shah made two changes in April against the Caribbean in the Lord's Test, with his home church in Middlesex, only ten transitions, and that, together with the immediate rejection of the electorate, when Vaughan wanted to relocate him to another game, his detonation seemed to have taken some of the elan that was so evident in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Esex University has the joy of living in the bones.
On the cricket floor, he does not take it away and his conduct outside the kitchen symbolizes a recently converted car with him on four cars on the exhibition day of the English team's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He carried out with slight injuries and suddenly shock, but as the first thing he pulled out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his co-player, who would have been watching him ask, "Did you see this?"
The bopara is definitely better in the field, its average speedy smiles on the surfaces that seem to fit him, is effectively distributed and burns himself and hand-in-hand.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe it's just the actual art of selection.
I personally hesitate to get Bopar's chance right now, which I do not want to say that Shah won't be great if, as celebratory tea leaves indicate, he'll be the one who's gonna play here next weekend.
Autobusy will bring the passengers back to work - and fight against al-Qaeda
The first buses filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria started to arrive in Baghdad yesterday and excavate refugees who had come to pay or spent their visas, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight the armed forces who escaped from their homes.
The Mansürs bus stop was already before 800 people from Damascus arrived in the official bus stop on the bus stop, full of passengers from Syria and Jordan who returned from private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubaysi, Sunni doctor.
"I'm back today because of what I've seen on television and what I've read in the news about what happened in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say Mahdí's army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Chilean military militia of the militarist Muktadi al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to cease the war.
Kasim al-Atwana, an eight-year-old Chilean teacher from the predominantly Sunni region of Amaria, returned with his two children because he could no longer restore the Syrian visa and because the dark regime did not allow the Iraqis to work.
His neighbors called him by means of a local war machine with the support of the American army to pull Al-Qaida out of its position on the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of the Sunni and Shiaish tribes, who from his home in Sleek in northern Baghdad avoided a border attack after he attacked his fellow citizens to rise against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"In the first place, several friends called me and told me that they were breaking up in Slekh's militia against al-Qaeda and that they needed me and the support of my mountains.
That's why I came back today," said 20-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many talked about the appeal of comfort in the main city after the strengthening of the American military presence and the growth of the local "group of the citizens involved", which is armed by the American army.
But it was more about the return of the ban on the river and the money exchanges in Damascus, where over 1.3 million Iraqis have been exhausted in recent years.
Salaam al-Samaraj, a 11-year-old father of three children, voiced the suspicion that Núri al-Maliki, the Czech Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on the visas and so on them back.
According to the available data, more than two and a half million people have been infected before Iraqi sectoral murders.
"It was all right before al-Maliki visited Syria and pressed on the government to stop giving the Iraqis visa to have them back to Iraq," said the Sunset.
"I can't believe the government that supports the criminals who burned me after my departure from the house."
Part of the reason for the slowdown of violence is the fact that the sunni were driven out of the coastal regions and yet, which in many places reduces tension.
There are concerns that the sudden increase in the pressure of the sector is slowing down and will lead to another battle.
Little Sarasko, good education
Germany's smallest national country plays a leading role in vocational education, and is even superior to the international focus of its high schools.
Only in one educational area, Sarako is concerned about the same deficit as the rest of Germany.
"The man who doesn't leave Saraska yesterday I explained that we are no French" - this seberonic word appears in Sarska on the payments for the 50th anniversary of the birth of this least social country.
France and Luxembourg are currently playing a major role in the training system of the Colin Institute for Economic Research (IW) in the fifth place.
High schools are thus traditionally co-operated with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 in France.
To date, students can complete the study by two years or even three.
It corresponds to a relatively high proportion of foreign students who make 15.6 %.
However, excessive numbers of Serbian children are admitted to high school - many of them even without a university degree.
"A professional education system is being used in Sarajevo," says Axel Plüncke, a teacher expert at IW.
The fact that more than every five-year-old is entitled to a vocational education is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared with the rest of Germany, there are rich opportunities in Syria to combine practical and academic education.
The opportunity to study two camps is given the number of the second best citizens throughout Germany.
In the past few years, the number of graduates of engineering has been through practically oriented education and ongoing demand.
Thus, the Serbian Ministry of Education has now ordered a high school to create a propaganda campaign on engineering.
"After the first study of Pisa, we conducted several refurbishment at schools in general," says the school's speech ministry.
As a result, the government carried out comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to start learning as early as possible, the last year of maternity schools is free - a model that is also passed on by other countries.
If the results of the claims are significantly improved, they will show that there will be comparison studies.
In the 2003 Pisa study, the proportion of risk complaints decreased from 29 to 20%.
However, Sarasko has not improved as much as any other country in the world.
Barrows can count better.
And to break up Saraska's study of the Scriptures does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages - in a negative case, Sarasko could be right in this area.
The language of the neighbours is still binding on the gymnasiums, even though the citizens of Sarska are not French.
Chávez takes time
What they don't see is going to spend hours in Venezuela, other than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December President Hugo Chávez will be allowed to spend hours in this South American country in half an hour back.
In Spain, between the Chavez and Spain is a funny figure.
The official letter of Venezuela reported that the hours spent in the new law would be reduced by less than four and a half hours.
The South American state will be this step in the time zone that is not existing in any other country of the world.
Chávez, an enemy of the United States, has given rise to his decision in addition to the fact that the United States of America has been involved in the distribution of time for the world after all hours.
In the middle of the local time, Chávez also announced that because of the cause of the handcuffs, the relationship with the neighboring Colombia was strained.
This left-wing nationalist has declared that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe president of Colombia will not maintain any relations with him or with the Colombian government.
"I can no longer vote for my own sake," said Chavez, who is implementing the reform of the Constitution, whose citizens must vote in the Sunday referendum.
This reform would strengthen its power in the country.
It was the decision of Uribe to withdraw Chávez's trust to negotiate in Colombia with Marxist rebels on the release of arms.
The Uribe Chávez criticised his decision to Venezuela's "flying face" on Sunday.
And in Spain, everyone's talking about Chávez.
The new mobile call here created a solution: "Why don't you call" (Why aren't you quiet?) - so the news that has already become more than half a million people on the Internet.
It was expressed by Spanish King Juan Carlos, who, at the recent Ibero-American summit, was so blinded by the label of the Left People that he was silenced.
Germans are at risk of lower costs in 2007
It is estimated that this year Germany's employees are at risk of lowering their real brains even through a strong convulsions.
The experts have given rise to their pessimistic prognosis for a number of reasons.
According to Nadace Hanse Böckler, in 2007, people can actually calculate their employment by getting lower income than in the last year.
"Vinu brings small increases in wages, tax increases in added value and price increases in food and energy," said Dr. Bild Gustav Horn of the IMK Research Institute (Institut für Makroekonomie und Konjunkturforschung).
New employee burdens may also be expected in the area of unemployment insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück to the news Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung said that, for the new year, the planned reduction in unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% is correct and reasonable in this situation.
However, the social agency should no longer fall into such hatreds to require loans or contributions from society’s youth to quote the news of this socio-democratic policy.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion of food and feed products avoided inflation at its highest level in the last thirty years.
In the annual price comparison, the total price rose by three per cent.
Venus is a two-sided country
The Venus Earth is more similar to its life-friendly atmosphere than ever before. The European space probe Venus Express in Venice has recorded the waves that appear in winter on Earth: lightnings in the atmosphere and winds in the fields.
Nearly three decades ago scientists suspect that it's blushing in Venice.
Now the European Venus Express probe has provided evidence - it has caught electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. In Venice, lightnings fly from the dark to the dark at about 56 kilometers high, wrote in the science magazine Nature Christopher Russell of the California University of Los Angeles.
According to the famous theory of the origin of the first mass, the Earth was able to produce life through mud. Bourgies evidently resulted in ocean reactions that led to the formation of amino acidselin, the basic stones of life.
There was no such thing in Venice: "If there had ever been life there, it must have been a long time," explains Sean Solomon of Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today there would be a living room on the surface of Venus. The atmosphere is about a hundred times worse than on Earth, and sometimes temperatures are around 500 °C.
"Wenush is probably a double Earth, but it's a double," said Russell.
Why Venus, which is the earth of mass and size so similar, has begun to develop completely different, is the basic question of Esa's mission.
In view of the fact that no probe has been sent exclusively for the study of Venus since the beginning of the 1990s, the beginning of the Venus Express probe in November 2005 was researched by this planet.
According to researchers, the most recent findings of research, which approached several articles in the journal Nature, did not highlight only the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They have also shown that our neighbouring planet is like Earth more than it's supposed to be," Esa said.
In addition to the famous windmills in the north, scientists have found a dark faith in the southern field, which is much faster.
This phenomenon commemorates air raids on the northern part of the country, writes the research team under the direction of Guiseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Astrophysica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second interior planet of our solar system creates almost the same amount as Earth and with an average of 12 100 km is almost the same size.
This planet is marked as the Day or Evening of the Sun for a minimum of 225 days.
However, along its own axis, it is much slower. One day in Venice, it lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus’s surface temperature is not mentioned at 460 °C and the pressure of 92 bars on Earth, scientists conclude that both planets have experienced very similar conditions.
The water was stored on both sides of the earth, but it remained in the oceans, while from Venus it was scattered into the universe.
While carbon dioxide poured on Earth is bound in Earth, in Venice most of the atmosphere is created.
Köhler announces Merkel's meeting with the Dalailam
The School President Köhler calls for the closure of the party disputes due to the adoption of a delegation to the Office.
The SPD did not criticise her attacks on the office after a mutual meeting in September.
School president Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's history and calls for a great coalition to put an end to its move towards the adoption.
"At the same time, we should not present ourselves as a nation which is not united on this issue," Köhler told the business newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding of the decision of the German Chancellor Angely Merkel (CDU) to take the dalailam in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, I have the right to universality," Köhler said.
The school president pointed out that everyone knew that Germany had to maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, but it did not prevent Merkel from stopping when she was counted as creating a new policy against China.
"The National Chancellor has not left China's traditional policy alone.
China also knows that," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) gave his immediate agreement with the adoption of the delay and was attacked by a number of coalitions.
Steinmeier was also involved in the "predictive" foreign policy of the coalition.
Following the adoption of this decision, the German-Chinese relations had deteriorated in the office.
The Chinese government not only rejected the invitation of the German Minister of Finance Peera Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to the information magazine SPIEGEEL, also rejected the so-called strategic dialogue of foreign ministers.
The Chinese president of the government, Wen Jiabao, called the Chancellor Angel Merkel to admit that our adoption was a mistake.
China does not agree when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China's position.
Our words and deeds have shown that Tibet is trying to separate from China, along with other Tibetan areas, which are also located in China.
Schäuble warns against similar disturbances that have erupted in France
Half-way fights with the police, shootings, fuelled cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns against similar disturbances that broke out in France.
We must do everything we can to ensure that social unrest in Germany does not break up in violence on the street, the Federal Minister of the Interior.
The baricadas were burned, the mob shot the police. After serious disturbing young people in France, the federal minister inside Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is afraid of similar developments in Germany.
"We need to be careful not to create such social tension that will lead to violence.
We have to take this seriously," said the Hannover newspaper Neue Presse.
Not every young person can quickly change social reality.
School government, countries and citizens are already working hard to solve problems, Schäuble said.
That's not just the integration of migrants.
"From the Summit on Integration after the Islamic Conference we record the first success."
However, caution is still in place.
Schäuble at the same time pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of German subjects are not comparable to those of France.
In the last few nights, youth with police in the northern provinces of Paris was a tough street fight.
And in Toulouse she burned cars and public buildings.
More integration efforts were required by the German government by the President of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the disturbances in France, Colat warned against "a similar effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
Still, it should be done.
Kolat pointed out that among people under 25 years of age who come from migrant families, unemployment is "a relatively high rate".
In particular, it is necessary to increase the number of study opportunities.
Kolat stressed: "We must give young hope."
The President of the Turkish People's Republic, however, added that in Germany there is more social control of the family than in France.
In addition, many young immigrants do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat said, "But we must pay attention."
We need young people to "be able to start working and learn."
In the middle of the night, it stayed in the Parisian province of Williers-le-Bel very quiet.
There were hundreds of police officers in the camp, and over the area, they transferred a flashlight to the lights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests and several fire-fighting bodies and cars.
Since yesterday, there are about 1,000 organized forces.
The police will be busy as long as necessary, notifying the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Michelle Alliot-Marie.
In the restrooms at the Villaers-le-Bel, about 80 police officers were injured on Tuesday night.
The next night, Toulouse got into trouble.
She was constantly causing Sunday transport accidents in which two teenagers came to life.
According to the initial finding of state representation, police carry no guilt at the death of young people.
In the "Obliques" Orchestra
The Cancleric's really far-fetched output proves that coalica is programmed at the end and that we can no longer expect anything more from it.
In what country does this office actually live?
After her infamous, relentless, and poor appearances on the general debate of the Smolkos snow, we have to find out: not here - not in the country that she should end up in.
As a result of being too focused on foreign policy, Angela Merkel once responded to a very arrogant spirit.
It's a provincial, she said, which she showed she doesn't want to understand what critics are saying.
In his speech, she clearly showed everyone how much she deserves this education.
Merkel had no real interest in it, and he felt for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela's "Oblakov" was presented: a political one that is against the others, who goes into foreign politics, and there is only a soft voice.
So for example, climate protection: without interrupting, they are grateful for the conclusions from the summit in Heiligendam, but they are no longer saying how the climate goals are to be achieved in Germany.
And in fact, such an attitude - so inconsistencies would leave the CDU president two years ago.
Now it's limited to a sentence plan that could increase the relationship between people.
This approach damages its pragmatic image, which does not need to be released because it solves problems.
But in the solution of Angel's "Obliques" there are internal political problems of extreme concern.
The child's poverty and the care of people with low income?
A few more knowledge on these issues has been left to her.
In fact, Merkel is often quoted as saying, when it comes to children's contributions.
Merkel has to start three times from the start in order to be able to express at least partially the correct opinion.
As soon as things start to be very concrete, it's stuck like in a very strange field.
Section of the Emissions
The debate of the Republican presidential candidates at Youtube, in the case of the favour of Rudy Giuliani and Mitta Romney, was discussed in the debate - and both must now fear an outside candidate.
Both candidates' pressure is already on the first topic.
Mitt Romney expects his opponent Rudy Guilian to make a "fiction for illegal immigrants" in New York.
Giulian quickly reacts to sharp statements: "I think his own house was just one such attack," and he replies to former governor Massachusetts that he personally employed immigrants without evidence.
The candidates are being attacked, given that the republican foundation has no clear preference, eight presidential candidates use these CNN debates mainly to discredit their opponents.
Half-minute, Internet users surrounded and via YouTube send videos only serve as key themes such as comments.
"Insolonizationism is exactly what we have allowed Hitler to gain power," John McCain pushes his opponent Ron Paulo, who is the only one who passes the immediate landing of the army from Iraq.
The Vietnamese veteran McCain does not protect himself or Romney by refusing to judge the torture method of the hearing called "Waterboarding", where the heat is simulated.
The public's reactions in the Florida St. Petersburg show that among the important topics of the campaign, there is no war in Iraq, no methods of torture.
The guarantee comes at a time when conservative values are appreciated and future tax increases are avoided.
So it's going to show where the weakness of both favorites lies.
"I was wrong at the time," explains Romney's mistake and asks for a page basis and a television release for the fact that in 1994 he was still a stopper.
Giuliani is in trouble when he has to express himself to the Bible’s literal interpretation.
Musharaf First Government in Civil
The day after his resignation from the position of the top army leader, Pakistani ruler Musharaf made a presidential oath.
That's the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
The President of Pakistan, Parvíz Musharaf, made a presidential oath on Thursday, and will thus remain in the presidency's office for the next five years.
Pakistan's television was broadcast a live ceremony that took place in the Presidential Palace in the capital of Islamabad.
The Musharaf swore that he would honor the constitution and defend the good people.
In the middle of his senior army officer's office, he handed over to his client Ashfaq Kiyan, who was subject to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after the power was gained in a bloodless military coup, the former general of the state first as the civilian head of the state.
Representing the position of the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Musharaf met one of the main requirements of opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the abolition of the exceptional status declared by Musharaf on 3 November.
According to the senior representative of Malik Muhammad Qayuma, Musharaf has broken the exceptional position soon after his accession, and has met the requirements of the West.
The Supreme Court of the State, which, following the declaration of the exceptional status at the beginning of November, has been arrested by its promulgated jurists, has rejected all objections to the re-establishment of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed during an attack on a military army in the territory of the North Vaziristan and four others were injured.
The speaking army reported that the bomb exploded on the road near the border with Afghanistan.
The father's crook is coming back
The famous German group of seventy years is playing again. Three of the Harmonium's members re-enacted their electronic synthesisers at a concert in Berlin.
Revival will also include Live 1974, sisters from the most successful period of the capel.
They've already been substantially more famous abroad.
The alleged sensation then starts with the appearance of three sitting gentlemen who at first seem to enjoy their dinners.
Everyone has a box, cables, and especially buttons.
Thirty-nine-year-old Dieter Moebius is sitting in the middle of the snowy bushes.
After his left, he's seventeen-year-old Michael Rother, who has a laptop and a guitar.
Thirty-nine-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who is focusing on the synthesisers, is looking at the monsters right away.
Everyone's singing sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, of course, it will result in a traditional fund.
Looks like it's not too much for you musicians.
Among the lovers, he called for a reviving of the Chapel of Harmonia's important solution.
One thing here stands for attention. Repeated questions have shown that this name of the network is part of the collective knowledge of the pop, but it certainly is not so quick that someone has been sickly ill for twenty-three years.
But why can't Germany celebrate its still living legends for seventy years?
And especially when you're a music-style, falsely called krutock, in England and America, you're worth more than your own country.
When in 2003, the music industry gave the remaining members of the Cancho group the price of Echo for their work in life, there was a lot of fascist views of German pops.
When, in addition, Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu groups for their appearance, the wonder of the monsters no longer knew the border.
Michael Rother later at the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts with them sat on the ice as their old friend.
The problem of homelessness and foreign worship is one thing.
By referring to the parable of the parable of the neighborly Samaritan, we are deeply concerned about the fact that the trio existed for only two years, and even at that time there was no such effect as they later read.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the solemn name of the cluster.
They started playing at the castle of the Berlin castle of Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons in the gramphone company of the church.
Rother had recently joined the Kraftwerk group, but the story was obtained as a guitarist at the Capeli Neu!, which at that time may have been the most radical German group.
In 1973, Rother was followed by the musicians of the Capéle Cluster until his exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, the 16th century, they lived as members of the community who fled the city.
They didn't live here as ideological as in Communist I, where Roedelius was still supposed to steal as a thief.
It's been a better life in such an art studio.
The name for the art is evidently derived from the name of the song collection Harmonia Ottenstein, whose record was found in the library.
A lot of the Harmonies have been keeping.
The first album was called "Hudba de Harmonie" and the following "De Luxe".
Although their music was so quiet and modest, it endured financial difficulties.
Growing up was not only a matter of self - recognition.
Now released CD "Live 1974" was first held at the concert in Grissem before recordly small, almost ten-year-old.
Rothera once expressed her desire that the members of Harmonius be exaggerated and cheered on occasion.
For Rodlia and Moebia, it was simply an unobserved request.
In 1975 the Capela announced her divorce.
He ended up in the esoteric sphere and made sure his future was with the album "The Hot Heart."
Chapel Cluster has lived again in the 1980s, and since then it's more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
As a live album from Grissemer, we can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His recording company Grönland took care of Krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
Chapel Neu! It was then considered Roedeli's solo work.
The body resurrection of Harmony will take place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The presentation under the Woldtronics festival will be publicly sponsored.
Next to Brit, Julian Cope, old pancake and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
He's also taking part in the founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
That's where we've planned a wide-ranging impact on the future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group is filled with harmony.
Briana Ana's answer, delivered by these most beautiful sounds, is in the hall: "The only true music, it belongs to the future."
There are pictures on which the producer of Harmonium is at the agricultural session.
It also contributes to the creation of legend to the sale of other black photos on which the seeds of divorcian devices are connected cables.
Before that, the three veterans are again employed in improvisation.
I don't like the microphones on the jars and the drums, so that they're out of the tools they've never heard of the unsound self-made tones.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three to the technique of punctuating the puncture.
It doesn't even change the congregation of the World's Cultures.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, the sound of the darkness is shining, and in one beautiful place the emphaticly sings "Aaaaaaaaaaaa!"
Krautrock was always a very English idea.
It's never been about rock.
The roots would be more than found in the blues in the music schools (Can), in the technology (Kraftwerk) or in the run-up to the artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
The one who calls this place '68!' is not so far away from the truth, but Harmonia is not even going to let it go.
And it's probably the most obvious thing to think about on the scene.
Where does music begin and when is it over?
This question is whether a person will be prepared for the nerves or before he will be able to survive the occasional moments of happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynic enough
With the introduction of The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, two films about the war in the Balkans appeared immediately.
But not one of them is convincing.
The presentation of the films is either too big a cause for activity and shooting, or they're too clever.
The Hunting Party doesn't even have a hero like Richard Gere.
The good news is as first: Karadzić and Mladic criminals are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but right there, in the southern part of the Bosnian War, here is Richard Gere Octne.
In recent times, we have lost this most beautiful man for 80 years, not only because he played in many favorite, trivial roles in wedding women's films, but in association with his press conferences forever on the subject of Buddhism, people will be interested in another film with this hero.
And yet Richard Gere is one of the strongest arguments for the tracking of The Hunting Party - Where does the hunter benefit (Why should the names of films be so long and confused today?)
Gere's military reporter Simon Hunt is basically the one who could become Gere if the judge and the film industry were not so kind: a man who has his best years behind him for a long time, but as a few similar memories, he still maintains a certain kind of confidence.
But despite this tumf, The Hunting Party is together with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also enters the cinema this week, only by continuing the endless series of successful films about the war in the Balkans.
With the film Mörderischer Frieden we can make a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save the Serbian girl from the Kosovo shooter, one of whom loves her.
While it is commendable that Serbs are not represented here as the cause of all evil, this television film is becoming too fast in shooting and action.
There'll be a lot of like Kobru 11 series from the film, without any distance, but for that war.
In the film The Hunting Party, we can briefly examine why the Balkan War has not been able to capture a really good film yet.
The experience of three U.S. war reporters, who appear to be a "lying" Serbian top war criminal, could be a new "Apocalypse" at another time and under the direction of another director and scriptist (here is both Richard Shepard).
However, both stories look surprising: small groups go to the forest to do something that is not military enough, but their path will become the path of madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of the film The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not that jealous and sentimental cynic represented at the outset.
On the other hand, his proposal also presupposes a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim.
The Hunting Party film can be finalized after reporting to reporters in the last five minutes of the film what NATO, CIA and all the hunters of the world have not said in the last five years: to catch the crimes and leave it to justice instead of Bosnian Muslims.
It's so against the logic of film creation that it's still going to the International Court of Justice in Haagu.
Right now, this movie has a deep human message.
It argues that Karadzić and Mladic are still free, and the Americans and Francoise (there are extremely united) suspects that on the basis of secret political agreements, they do not believe that monitoring is sufficiently intense.
But good and bad are sometimes like that, the woman who attacks us is celebrating Brecht's pool.
It refers to the wooden mask of the Asian demon on the work desk of the writer: "I look at the triumphal processions on my head, note: how it is intended to be evil."
In films such as The Hunting Party, there are exactly such touching heads, but they show how intentional it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to war in the Balkans.
Recently, in these newspapers, it was written that all Hollywood films about Iraq were a great failure.
It can be added only: There has never been any good film about South Africa yet.
Nearly always pays: When the star passes through the crisis area or passes through the mini field, it creates a film such as Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, Borders of Evil with Angeline Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCapria.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close to time.
Finally, they had to run ten years before Hollywood was able to film a good movie about the Holocaust - Schindler's list.
Many films must obviously be re-examined - films that are considered classic Vietnamese today - "Lovec yelenos", "Apocalypse" or "Apocalyps" - were not then celebrated as mystical works.
But maybe today, when every mass murder occurs at home on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
Then the scanners do not have the ability to make sure that good stories are correct.
"To be or not" or "Great dictator" became so good, because Lubitch and Chaplin did not yet know how terrible the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe a man doesn't want to be good when he wants to do good movies.
Maybe you need to create a sarkastically appropriate artistic view as a novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was staged on a parallel between his historical novel "Lemprier's Dictionary" and "Balk's War", he declared, "It's just as quiet that some things never change.
The big cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be killed in a terrible way and war will always be in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust concludes the criticism of the Olympics
Representing the ageing of the organisation of the annual Olympic Games in Hamburg has led to a sudden policy and economic crisis.
A lot of people want to go on fighting about getting her in the water.
Von Beust, but he's trying to get realism in the way of chance.
The main business director of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, in the middle, noted this decision "from the point of view of the accident".
No other project has recently gone through the city with such great motivation as the Olympics.
"Without this objective, it would not be possible to maintain this sport political overrun to such a high extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called upon the Senate not to bury this project, but to create for him a new long-term concept, "which comes from a modified timetable."
Old Ole von Beust stayed in the middle of his earlier announcements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg are not realistic until 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic sports party will decide on the Olympic candidate," said von Beust to the WELT Online newspaper.
He pointed out that at the beginning of the December, the Sports Council will decide on the Mnich's candidate for the Winter Games in 2018.
"This preference for us means that we have no realistic chance with the 2028 time plan."
Still this dream didn't end, von Beust said.
The Hamburg sports club (HSB) marked von Beautov's productions for policymaking.
It will be concluded that Hamburk does not want to be able to organize the Olympic Games in the next twenty-five years.
"It's still too early to destroy the chance that plans are already marked as buried in this early phase," said the middle president of HSB, Günter Plus.
On the other hand, it would be contrary to the statement by the head of the Senate, who led to the ruling assembly of the General University of Germany.
Von Beust did not report this to the University of Hamburg as a reward for organizing the Olympic Games in 2015.
The high school sports club Hamburk first appointed for the candidate city last week.
The SPD Group in the Hamburg Parliament of Senat found that it was a valuable time that could be used to build houses in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area was early in the Senate for setting up the Olympics and building of apartments," SPD envoys Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD for the Klein Grasbrook region was still planning the Olympics with the fact that the entire area will later be used for the housing purposes, the CDU unanimously put on "the Olympic factor".
The 2012 Summer Olympic Games took place in Hamburg with great excitement.
But Hamburg spent it on Lipska.
It's not Warhol's tie.
The one who combines the expressions of Sweden and the wooden baths, doesn't think about Andy Warhol, but about Ike.
Or what?
The trees of the present time produced in Sweden are on the list of dark stone parts of Warholov.
Most of the 19 of his list of the four "Brillo Boxes" type Stockholm are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" expressed doubts about the validity of the Warholov "Brillo Box" since 1968, the internal research of the Museum of Modern Museet in Stockholm comes with a result of disappointment; six "Brillo Boxes", which in 1995 was awarded to its former director, Pontus Hultén, copies - like most of the other "Brillo Boxes" that are on the international art market in Stockholm.
The past events are complicated, a measurable network of art and curatorial actions.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, cut down wood beds, which were based on the red-air design of the paper boxes of Brillo powder.
The exhibition of his work in Modern Museet in 1968 presented - with Warhol's agreement - the hundreds of Brillo's tape from the card. They did not leave (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from Brillo's factory.
It wasn't about art, but about their proposals, it was just a showcase.
Warhol evidently granted permission in 1968 also to make several wooden Brillo bedens in Sweden, but they are not displayed in modern Museet.
These Witnesses are now talking about the fifteen baths, which are currently legally bound to art and auction history as authorised originals - "Andy Warholovy Brillo Boxy" with the label Type Stockholm.
Some of them were exported to auctions in excess of $100,000.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum later falsely claimed that in 1968, about a hundred beads were manufactured and displayed in Sweden, which Warhol then left.
In fact, 105 Hultén's beads were manufactured in Malmö for exhibition in Petrohrad first in 1990.
Warhol was three years after his death.
Lars Byström, top conservative Moderna Museet, researched in addition to six Brillo boxes, which are owned by the museum, also three Brillo boxes from Swedish private collections, of which two were created in Sweden in 1968 and after which their crossboards were painted with a background color and painted, were painted with a white colour.
However, from the structure of the 1990 copy, it was discovered that the color was not the original character of the painting directly on the crossboard - in addition to the acrylic and not the oil color.
"These bets were not authorised by the artist and should be removed from Warholov's official Brillo box," said Director Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the organisation of Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to another conclusion, Moderna Museet will have to be classified six bedens from its exhibition collections as "representative material - copy".
Already in July, the organisation of the Authentication Board announced that these "serious charges" that were raised in the case of a copper with a powdered powder will be killed.
But the organization is still in constant silence.
Rebellious soldiers in Manila surrender

The National Security Council of Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of soldiers.

"We invite people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, former elite leader Scout Rangers said that more military units will soon be joined.
The government's critics called for a great demonstration against the president on Friday.
Her government has been counting corruption for months.
The Manila financial area has already become the main event of approximately 200 soldiers against the Arroyos in 2003.
Because she refused to join the army, she was forced to spend the last 24 hours.
Since 1986 at least seven times in the Philippines have tried to overthrow the democratically elected government.
