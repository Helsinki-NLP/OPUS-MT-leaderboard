A victory of the best populists in Austria, total of 29 percent
The significant reduction of the two sides of the higher education and the significant strength of the top-level populist parties have been achieved by the first preliminary results of the Austrian parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The Austrian Népárt (OVP), where the current president, Wilhelm Molterer's position, suffered a severe loss, particularly.
In contrast, the President of the Association for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Chairman of Karintia County, Jörg Haider, is preparing a successful return to national policy.
On the basis of the previous results, the country's most powerful party remains with 29.8 percent of the votes in favour and 5.5 percent of the votes in the 2006 elections.
Even worse has been the OVP, which will lose nearly nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These two large parties have already achieved the worst results in the postwar history of Austria, and the result is disastrous, according to Germany, which has led to the next elections.
At the beginning of July, the People's Party had a significant advantage at the beginning of the OVP co-operation according to the public opinion studies prior to the SPA.
However, the voters were apparently punished for letting the government collapse.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations have already been heard by President Wilhelm Molterer and the possibility of a possible withdrawal of the current sub-cellular.
Observers believe that this can be held this week at the extraordinary meeting of the Board of Directors.
This development would probably facilitate the renewal of the SPA and OVP of the electoral outcome.
With regard to the strengthening of the two top-level populist parties - the Free Party of Austria (FPS) first received 18 percent of the votes and the BZZO 10 percent of the votes - at the same time, social Democrats expressed their concern about the re-establishment of 1999 when the People's Republic of the Congo was joined by the populace (the FPZ was still united with the BZU in 2005), which also imposed sanctions on the European Union.
Hayder, who has already announced that he is ready to cooperate with any party, and I expect him to return to Bécs in his national policy, obviously counts for this solution.
The Green Party has also come to Parliament, which, however, has lost some of its popularity and has returned to the third place between the political parties of the districts.
Not one of the other parties has gone beyond the four-percent threshold and has not come to Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Indian relations can be broken
If it failed to solve the problem of Czech sciences reported for illegal mining, the Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said that there could be some confusion in Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister did this in New York after meeting with Pranab Mukherdzsi, an Indian partner.
"If this didn't work out, then yes, there would be some disappointment," he said after the meeting, which was prompted by Czech encouragement.
Mukhherdzsi said after the hearing that the executive power could be placed in court.
However, he noted that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was released from prison and was sentenced to trial, the central government could deal with the local government of Darjeeling, which is governed by the law.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
The three-year sentence against Emil Kuchere, however, according to Mukhherdzsi, would be the best way to get closer to the Supreme Court.
Then he could ask for a place free of charge and wait for the judgment to be delivered, explained it.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that the partner had a similar end in the course of the negotiations.
"He proposed an appeal to the Supreme Court, then it would be possible to rescue him," said the head of the Czech diplomat.
The only way to get into the whole case is to give the alleged "competent legal support", said the Indian Minister.
At the same time, he said that the Indians are already providing such help.
"We are most interested in maintaining the best relations with India with many years of age.
The Indians recognize this," Schwarzenberg said.
As the Czech Republic pointed out, as the Czech Republic said, the problem of Czech entomologists is of great importance.
"We are in fact deeply concerned about the interference of these Czech scientists and the situation of the accused," he said.
The question is whether the Indian party received a promise to deal with the case, and the Minister gave the answer.
"How many promises have I received," he noted.
Czech judges in the war for seafarers
It's on the remote electronic map of Australia and the surrounding coast.
But they don't care about the area, but they're a point that's different in the ocean's blue.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the neighbouring sea.
In the area, like you are the continent," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the ENSZ Division and maritime affairs of the 13th working group.
Chief, Václav Mikulka, the director of the division, is paying attention to the explanation that he sometimes prepares.
There's work and breathing here.
The seamen are rich in natural resources, yet they are almost unknown to the world.
It is possible to be present here with oil, copper and other sweeteners, but still living organisms that may be the key to the development of a medicine against cancer.
Larger seafarers than coastal areas
In our day, the remnants of the States are actively seeking new areas under the new sea.
According to the UN Convention, the same rights are applied to which they were held in Montego Bay, Germany, in 1982.
First of all, this is the area of the so-called continental policy, which often extends hundreds of miles from the parts of that country.
Such a country has the exclusive right to all origins of the Continental Standard under the Convention.
"Simplify the continental principle of the part of the sea and the bottom line of the sea, which is the natural continuation of the underground subsea.
On the shores of the sea, it is often two hundred miles away. It is beyond the economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by that country must be supplemented by a detailed scientific and technical documentation based on a number of cost-effective research and measurement-based documents, which are beyond the limits of the Continental Standard.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical assistance.
The Commission has already addressed five questions, Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three countries mentioned were successful," adds Mikulka.
In the world, Australia has been a successful return, first of all, which has substantially expanded the country under the sea.
But New Zealand has also won - about 1.6 million square miles of sealand, six times the country's territory.
In both countries, it's worth millions of dollars.
The future benefits of seafarers will be unestimable according to their expectations.
Other countries also continue to submit their requests.
This can be done within ten years from the moment of ratification of the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the Continental Standard ends, the Convention begins the territory of the oceans declared "the common heritage of mankind".
There's no special situation in this country anymore.
The right of production shall be granted by the international institution established by the Convention in this field.
"The seafarers, however, are not Clondike," said Director Mikulka, adding that "some areas could be around very clearly and cut into a contract."
Check the Cendes Ocean
It's part of the Czech Republic today.
This former Eastern block divides into other countries within the common "Interocean Metal" organization.
This organization, based on the Convention in 1991, received its status as a "passenger investor" similar to that of some other countries.
He was entitled to grow in the area of ClarionClipperton, between the Mexican, Hawaii and Kiribati, in the Csende Ocean.
The area under investigation by the investor is much larger than the former Czech Republic.
The seafarers are there, there's a second floor under the Tatra.
"This can be produced in all 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich place for polymetallic crafts containing nylon, rice, cobalt and manganese," says another lawyer, Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, the division macedon worker shows another specific example.
He remembered a Burgundy or a little fantasy about Golem's life-sacrifices.
Germans were special forces at the time of liberation
The Egyptian government asked Germany for help in solving the drought, and experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but their entry was not delayed.
More and more details are being made of the release of ten European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also involved in the hospital.
According to the German Federal Authority, the GSG 9 aircraft of the Federal Authority and the Federal Criminal Service were also at the point of release, as well as the logistics experts of the German Technical Service.
According to the week-to-week news from the Ministry's speakers, the German forces did not always need to run because the prosecutors were allowed to run their jobs and then went away when they recognized the signs of violent persecution.
The Government of Egypt accepted the aid offered by Germany in order to assist as a supporter.
"This has not been a success," declared the spokesman of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September, the attackers launched a group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman, and eight Egyptian spies in the south of Egypt.
After the invasion of the southern part of Egypt, the tribes of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad heard of it.
The disclosure of the complainants was always unexplained, such as the details of the release of the complainants or the possible variable payments.
The survivors arrived in the building in Cairo in time.
Steinmeier announced that the freed hostages are under the protection of German succession.
He did not disclose any details of the free permit.
First, there was no information from Berlin about when they were returning to Germany.
According to the "Bild" daily, five tourists and special forces arrive at the German Air Force aircraft in Germany.
The U.S. Secretary of State will refuse the package.
A small majority of the U.S. Congress subsidized $700 billion for the money markets.
The Dow Jones is in the middle of two.
The U.S. Board of Directors has not voted in favour of 206.
George W. Bush did not receive a majority despite the calls of both political leaders, the program, which wanted to raise money markets to be affected.
The sponsors have no doubt tried to convince the critics of the need for a $700 billion package during a dramatic action.
Barney Frank, one of the negotiating leaders of the Democratic Party, spoke up to the representatives, even though the plan is still not popular.
"It's hard to get political support to avoid something that has not yet been done," she confessed.
The Dow Jones vote is more than 6 percent and 600 points.
Investors were concerned that the state emergency package could be damaged.
In the short term, the index increased before the vote to re-enter the public after the failure.
Experts are counting on further serious turbulence in the international financial markets.
To enter into force of the programme, both the House of Representatives and the Senate must be approved.
The organizers are registering more and more.
It's a good deal for German travel organizers.
According to one study, the turnover of travel bookings for the following months has increased significantly over the previous year by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak concentric phenomena, German travel was not successful according to the study.
The travel agencies recorded 31 percent increase in sales for the previous year - known in Berlin as the German Travel Society (DRV) last week.
According to the GfK market research institution, the number of previous months' commitments has already been higher.
In October 2007 the travel authorities sent 11 percent of their sales on the road to October 2007 and announced the DRW.
These results are based on GfK's data, which evaluates the monthly booking data of the 1200 German travel agency and then extrapolates the whole market.
The Authority took into account the travel completed by the end of August 2008.
In particular, because of the low dollar rate, travel to the United States was sought - he announced the DRW.
The size of the reservations here has increased by one third.
The Germans are particularly pleased with their destinations, as well as Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as their homes.
At least I've been looking for organized roads - said Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
Due to increasing energy and food costs, the costs of organised roads can be calculated "more accurately for passengers than for organised trips."
Travellers may be able to collect money, including subscriptions, including Laepple.
It was also very good for the months to be booked, so it is possible to re-enterprises over the previous year - even though another study said that the previous year was a less German tourist.
First October
Unscrupulating ballermann sludges, literate corsorptions and disenchanting reputations.
Debt in Wiesnen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't actually compare much to each other.
He's a hot, televised artist, and he's wearing a haircut.
My hair's black, I'm a student, and I bought my clothes in the truck.
One thing, however, has brought us together: We're almost three minutes from Wiesnen, we're already destroyed by the photos and destroyed their memory cards - very exciting, and all our first visits to Wiesnen.
That's what we can do for friends.
It seems that the white ring is making enough for your order.
As Wiesn-tourist of the north from the white club, my comfort is still limited to the public.
But by the way to Theresienwie, it's not that late.
Almost everyone wears shirts or leather hats; no one looks look bloated or Chinese - everything's fine.
It's just my ring chain.
A Munich woman calls out to me that I was wrong to tie the chain: "You're free from any connection, you're free, you're better off, you're a virgin."
In secret, I left the table on the left.
"It's good," she says, and her name.
Others have smaller surfaces around fine flashing techniques, and a simple flashbox series "I'm too involved in getting up" with the "I'm getting up" cover, and they're unquestioned to show the backbones.
Bob, a young man who showed the exhibitionist scenes, was called, and he first visited October.
What you're looking for is amazing, as long as you're giving me "aaaaaaa."
All of this then tells me that he was free from the contents of his former corset.
Right next to one of the fires that everyone looks at.
So Bob's one of the famous "tilos in the water."
Others are not so lucky that they can break free from alcohol.
At eight o'clock in the evening, the rescuers finally leave the place and take care of the poor guys.
The injectors always appear in the team - once a four-ciples sympathies on a syllable.
This works as for most Wiesn visitors: Access is empty, distance is long gone.
That's not what it looks like when it comes to alcohol, it doesn't look like it.
"Those who are totally ready" - one of the chancellors asked me about my question, and then in the store.
The police called the victim of the accident.
The police named the 63-year-old woman who hit an Essex car and died in the hospital.
The accident took place on Friday afternoon with Chelmsford Road, with Carole Paulson at Shenfield Road.
The Romanford Queen's Hospital was sent to the hospital, but later he died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested with a suspicion of ill-treatment.
They've been released from prison since then.
Turkey's diplomatic horizon
Before Turkey would have been able to join the European Union, the European powers would have been moved from the desire to be able to enter the country as far as Turkey is concerned.
On the east side of Bosnia, perhaps only 20 steps from the European border, is one of the largest relics of the closed bureaucracy.
The Hydarpasha train station is built by two Germans, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu designed in a modern style.
At least the travel books write this.
The building is surrounded by the end of the tunnels, at the top of each tower, and looks like a German village.
The stone is beautiful.
The whole building's kind of flattened.
However, in view of the internal character of the replacement label, it was clearly the largest company in the world.
The state was opened by the German Consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation in August 1908.
In Germany, the promises are "beyond future" from Damascus through Baghdad, with the help of today's Saudi Arabia, to achieve the ambitions for the Middle East agreement.
Germany's hopes for peace were met during World War I.
The streets were attacked by the Arabian Lawrence and the Arab Party.
The relatively remoteness of the surrounding regions caused by the Cold War has disappeared.
The British warlord came out of Egypt and cut off the Turks and their German alliances from Palestine and Syria.
Hyderpasha's stand was not better.
In 1917 a fire-fighter broke out and destroyed the well-formed roof of the building.
According to the sources of waste, there was a Saturday action.
It's been a long time since, and it's been overextended.
At the same time, it serves as a diplomatic horizon, at least in a symbolic sense, along the Anatólia and the entire eastern region.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the ACP - has been working on a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relatively remoteness of the surrounding regions caused by the Cold War has disappeared.
The new policy is a matter of commitment.
It is worth noting that the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, the Hamas and Fatah Palestinian groups, Iraq, Iran and, of course, the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to measure the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I moved to the capital of the Turkish city, Ankara, to visit one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish Parliamentary Representative, Suat Kiniklioglut.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours after the ceremony, which was then given the famous documentary about the old world, also the "The Night Mail" rhythm - I came to the capital of the castle. The new city is called the symbol of the new world state, which turns back to the past.
However, the AKP, which has a medium-sized capacity, represents a paradigm change in the concentration of particles.
This raised some doubts in peace, especially in Washington.
With taxis I went to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern, stone and steel building that was designed for this purpose - which is located in a growing out-of-town district, half-ready shopping centers and coffee shops.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have included a better-friendly politician in any other European country.
He's dead, he's wearing a jacket, and I'm sure he's got another Blackberry with him.
"The party's foreign policy aims to assist Turkey's reintegration into its immediate environment.
The Cold War has opened the agenda," she said.
Turkey's out of three countries.
He had to turn outside and calm down once today.
He couldn't choose one of the two.
He had to open both directions.
"But it's possible that it's hard to choose ahead of time?" I asked.
"Turkey never wanted an answer."
He then stressed what I said to everyone here, almost physically repeated: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea countries are serving the same benefit for Europe and the United States as it is for Turkey.
It is as if they would like to convey the message that - in the past - with Turkey, all of Europe can reach Asia and the Middle East along the road that lies ahead.
When I was back in Hydarpasha's apartment, after a new, good-looking night, I thought about Herr Ritterre and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemen who had completed the construction of this beautiful building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would be to learn that Europe's Middle-Celetic ambition is now in the hands of Turkey.
And while I was waiting at the door for the summit to return to Bosnia, it was thought that at that time Turkey was called "European Patients."
At least at least recently there was no question about which part of the land you were going to need in this exciting country.
Remembered lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Since 1962, as director of Guildford's music, Vernon "Tod" Handley has been leading the Guildford Philharmonics Zenkart and Korust.
On the basis of the city’s music plans, he established a wonderful youth choir, Proteus in the following year.
They could have been in the music for only 21 years, but when Proteus died in 1979, many of us were in our late 20s - we were simply not going to change the course.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological reformer) was in line with the beauty and ability of the crown to be adorned with any sheet that is before them - be it of the magic, or a stone of the Messiah; without temptation or great temptation.
Such a young Korean music volume was often babbling and always exciting, and we could thank the person whose inspiration for the music had remained unchanged over the years.
How often Tom told us, "Let's stop talking about the music."
He always said, "The musician knows what he wants.
It's all in the book.
So sing out!"
Karmester's technique was always completely understandable and accurate, but never dictatorial or excessive.
Whatever was in his music, he always lived on it.
John Frayn Turner wrote about:
If you ever lived with a hunter who was supposed to be a horse, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in your two-year-olds who led the Guildford Philharmonics from 1962 to 1982.
Over 100 concerts last year, I wrote a review of the last four months, but I never felt disappointed, and I often met them.
Tod Handley was together with the greatness and love, which is very rare.
He hated the warriors who, in his words, lived with him, simply "two well-known knights have been put to death all over the world."
He's gonna miss us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes the following:
According to the micrologist William Woodruff (September 25, 1946), "his studies of economic history went on in Oxford, and in 1950 he was promoted by the Houblon-Norman Research Institute... while he was continuously preparing for the acquisition of basic diplomas, master's diplomas and PhD."
This is from Woodruff's artist's list of art called "Beyond Nab End", but it's wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953 the economic history taught in Nottingham University, while Professor J. D. Chambers completed PhD's distribution of British rubber, which was then referred to as "The British rubber" in 1958.
In 1950-51, it was held in the United States by a Houblon-Norman promotion, and in 1952 at the University of Illinois, New York and Harvard.
He finally left Nottingham and moved to Illinois in 1953.
You can't tell Woodruff why he's been making this time better.

"J. Vicente Resino" "Flamenco and Life" is an offer because black-white, documentaryist-style photographers are amazing.

I'm going to resuscitate the wonderful moments."
Second time also sales record from Honduras
On November, Honda began marketing the second generation Jazz.
Yes, it has already been a long way ahead, but the construction of the new model's interior area is even more difficult.
It is all designed with a steaming mechanism that makes driving easier and enhances fuel storage.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
That's how the second generation of Honda Jazz looks.
Although the new Jazz vision is very similar to the previous one, a number of internal changes have been made.
These include, for example, innovative teeth, new carts, larger sizes and new mechanics.
But before we get to know the new model in detail, we have to say that the new Jazz has been on the market for six years after the first generation.
So for the first time, we can assume that Hondán has been able to update this model for a short time than for other manufacturers.
In Europe, Jazz knows less, but it decides sales records in other markets.
For example, such a market in Japan, where in 2002, and this year in 2008, Jazz was the most sought-after car.
In Japan, for example, almost a million dollars have been paid from Jazz since the market was launched.
The second market was the Old Continents, with an example of nearly half a million people over six years.
However, Honda wants to continue to increase trade in the area with the new Jazz.
By the time the Japanese company had totalled 83,000 Jazz in 2007, it had a target of 100,000 car sales in 2009, resulting in 17% increase in the European market.
Since 2002 the Spanish market has sold Honda 8000 darab Jazz, which represents 6.7% of the whole Spanish industry of Honda.
In the case of the new generation, the leaders of the Spanish subsidiary are calculated by an example of 2000 during the year of the invasion.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly facilitate the return of Honda to Spain.
The same 22,000 examples of company representatives will be improved by the end of this year, which means a reduction of 16% less than 4000 by the 2007 data.
Despite the sales conditions, Honda increased its share of the Spanish market in Spain, which increased by 1.6% compared to 1.8% of the average.
In 2010, I'd like to increase this rate by 2%.
According to Honda's hopes, this will be achieved by introducing a new model.
This would be Insight, an attractive and compact - 4370 mm long - hybrid, from which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 darabots in the world.
According to Japan's manufacturer, the Insight market share of 50% would be made by the United States while the rest of you are divided between the Old Continents and Japan.
Insight's commercial introduction is carried out in the first months of the year after the official Valencian presentation scheduled for January.
For the first generation, the new Jazz has become more popular in all respects.
The length is 3300 mm (five centimetres longer), the width of 1690 mm (two centimetres larger) and the sea level was 5 centimetres, i.e. 2500 mm.
In contrast, 1520 mm is unchanged.
Along with the sizes, the road has become more intense.
The larger inner layer is partly the new corrosion, partly the guarantee of medium-sized fuel - this solution is already known from the previous Jazz.
Moreover, the so - called double - bottomed container has grown to a total of 399 litres, or 19 litres, of which the capacity of the first generation is greater.
Although these amounts apply to the type provided by the 1.4 engine, the 1,2 Honda Jazz pack holder is 379 litres.
Some external changes can also be detected, such as the backlight lamps or the selectable panorama, as well as the easy proximity of the back seats.
In addition, the opening of the doors for the back seats was 80 degrees, compared to the first Jazz 67 degrees.
The second generation jazz engines are new.
At the start of the sale, this small model can be equipped with two, 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
The use of both sources of energy by i-VTEC technology would be preferable to the previous model, as well as lower carbon dioxide emissions and apparent mechanical comparability, while the engine would provide excellent performance in all respects.
The output of 1,2 litres of power is 90 litres of 6000 and maximum pressure is 114 Nm 4900.
This engine - which was 78 litres in the previous Jazz - consumes 5.3 litres and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
The other engine, which produced 83 litres in the previous generation, is now 100 litres.
The 100-powered 1.4-litre Jazz uses an average of 5.4 litres, and its emissions are 128 grams of CO2.
The triggering "major"
In order to develop pre-haul technologies, Nissan has now developed a sense of nature, precisely the desire for new inventions from the world of mice.
The Japanese company has designed a robot that's gonna take the risks out after the bears are gone.
Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C may be the first step in developing pre-requisite technologies.
The Directors of Nissan Motor Co. Development Technical Centre, in collaboration with the Scientific and Technological Research Centre, built this small robot in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Technological Pre- and Research Development Market Manager, the BR23C further expands Nissan's 4th security guard belt.
The robot is more fully capable of attracting the products of the company.
During the flight, each month presents your own personal design, which is very similar to that of the Nissan security guard.
However, the role of the meh composed person who sees in every direction more than 300 tops. As a result, the meh itself can easily recover in the personal field.
To remove the complex eye function, the sizers designed a so-called laser Range Finder.
The device shall identify obstacles within at least 180 metres before the BR23C view, calculates the distances, and shall send a signal to the surface microprocessor, which shall be immediately operated to prevent the injury.
"As a result of the observation of the obstacle, the small robot changed its direction immediately with the movement of the wheels in a smaller or larger direction in order to avoid injury.
The system is, above all, different from the currently available tools, in which case the opposite manoeuvre is automatically broken.
If not so, the robot could not respond fast enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the project's main comments.
By way of contrast, the source line shall not be guided up or down, and not in a mean way, only in two dimensions and only in relation to the ability to reversibility of the wheels, i.e. not in an infinite direction and as in the case of the wheels.
That is why Nissan used a rotational function in the robot to avoid injuries.
"This structure needs only a few seconds to process the data and respond to them.
There is no need to store data, nor to intuitical logic based on previous manoeuvres, so you can only operate with a few thousand KB memory without interruption.
This may sound great, but it's not really gigaby, but we're not even talking about big megabytes.
This is the first step towards the development of the technology that serves to prevent immediate injury, which may enter the production vehicles within ten years of the Nissan estimates.
The robot works with lithium polymer accumulators, which are easier and more durable than lithium.
In the future, the installation of the unit with the GPS's artificial navigation system can be an additional application opportunity to drive the vehicle away from existing obstacles to the end.
I'm sorry about the signal.
We need to know that the U.S. Royal School has a lot of investment funds, but they don't take it very seriously.
As the crisis raged, and the Americans did not want to be able to run into the players of the taxable brands, they created a fun and informative net game at the Bad Credit Hotel.
This is the "Brussels Trust Hotel"... that's her head.
The hotel and mainly the picture of the reception buscomor suggests, let's think again, twice, the truth, more than three times, is actually the time of the loan.
And most importantly, where we're going to believe, because it's probably the purpose of this.
The available information on the website is useful, but it is less detailed.
They're better than the big community.
But what would happen if we added the game?
For example, in the hotel, you can show us our dream room.
Actually, it's something, because we're not going to dream about buying a apartment...
Morgan Stanley opens his head for the MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced that he would provide his capital to the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest bank in Japan pays $9 billion for the company's capital by 21% after the Morgan Stanley shares were sold in the stock.
One week after the previous agreement was publicized, the two banks told MuFG to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's shares in $25.25, or $3 billion.
The accepted price remains more than 19% of the value of the securities in accordance with the book of August 31.
The MUFG provides additional $6 billion for the purchase of securities that can be converted into a 10% return and exchange rates of $31,25.
Morgan Stanley says that when the global transaction is carried out, 29 dollars will be taken on the basis of an average of $28 per cent higher than my current price.
However, Morgan Stanley's participation rate was around 6.79% in the middle of Greenwichi, and it was 23.07 dollars.
"This strategic alliance offers a great opportunity for Morgan Stanley to speed up the exchange of banking companies," explains John Mack, director of the U.S. company.
Morgan Stanley left his new status last week to diversify his activities while under the control of the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with the MuFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis requires even greater caution from the Wall Street companies.
The terms reported on the week show otherwise that the agreement has been amended in the last days: last week Morgan only reported that its share of 20% would be paid to the Japanese company for around $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, we thought that the participation would be made up of all ethnic groups," explained Toshihide Mizuno, director of the MuFG Attorney's Office in Tokyo.
"But because of the current market and economic situation, we would have been willing to minimize and avoid possible risks."
With the weighted average, the MUFG pays 7% more for Morgan Stanley's shares than the book says.
As a result of the transaction, I'm bringing about 20% of the share.
According to the agreement, MUFG may be converted into primary shares over a year if the last trading price exceeds over 50 % over a specified period of time, i.e. around $47.
Morgan Stanley thus ensures that using MUFG funds, it can use its investment opportunities, improve its size and increase its liquidity resources.
However, the Group's speakers did not want to provide accurate information on the two new strategic plans.
Following the MuFG survey, Morgan Stanley is expected to grow by about 15% in the rate of payment according to Tier I, which will be one of the best in its own sector.
Morgan has declared his measurement "determined" since the end of August.
In the past few weeks, a great deal of effort has been made to the group because the price of its shares has fallen on the side while the cost of ensuring the risk of non-payment has fallen to the ground.
This cost was measured on a weekly basis, but still remained at about 12% high.
One of the big investment banks remained "survivor" after the purchase of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch. This was Goldman Sachs, who reported it came to $15 billion last week: a part of this came from Berkshire Hataway, Warren Buffett's company.
Rafael Correa weekly announcement, Quito
The restoration of the public in the spirit of socialism in the twenty-first century.
This is the common plan for Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correán.
Following the pattern of its presidents and friends, Correa opened her new constitutional ideas on Sunday.
It was successful because 64% of voters voted in favour of the vote according to the official results for 80% of the votes.
According to the population, 28% voted, 7% of the votes in favour, while 0.7% of the votes in favour were cast.
For the adoption of the draft Constitution, 50% + 1 votes were required.
On Sunday, two tests carried out at the polls and one civil organization's calculations demonstrated a significant proportion of the "yes" votes at 63% and 70%.
In other words, Rafael Correa has already talked about the success of his constitutional plan on the weekend of spring.
"The Constitution has shown the first victory," he said, and thank the Ecuadorians in Guayaquil, located about 180 kilometres south of Quittól.
As I learned, Mr. Rafael Correán, Mr. Chavez, Mr. Morales and the Chilean president, also congratulated Michelle Bachelet.
According to the mission of the United States Service (OAS) to monitor the vote, the main theme was a 444-point text, which included the principles of "new socialism" protected by the President.
The proposed Constitution establishes the power of the State to serve the economy, including the right of the State to "development planning" for a country which is based on the production of oil by foreign companies and the exchange sent by foreigners.
The Republic of Korea's proposed Constitution in 2006 also reinforces the authority of the State which can receive a mandate for at least two consecutive years and has the right to extend the national assembly.
Correa has already announced that she would like to live with this opportunity, and she is renegotiated in February 2009 for her official mandate.
The Constitution also included health services and the freedom of education. The President has already introduced it into a country with 13.9 million inhabitants, and the wife of the people lives in my presence.
Finally, the Act prohibits the presence of foreign teams in the country, which may end with the use of an Ecuadorian facility based on American drug abuse measures in Quito and Washington.
They were released in the 19th century C.E.
The Egyptian commander struck down the men who had spent ten days in pursuit of the Ten Commandments and eight spies.
The tribes are now in Cairo.
Ten European tourists and eight Egyptian explorers spent ten days in the wilderness, where they were transported safely to the capital of Egypt.
He released the hostages during the course of the day in Chad by an Egyptian commander.
Apparently in good condition, about half of the South came by plane to the al-Maza military base, which is directly connected to the Turkish international airport.
The officers were prevented from announcing to the press and immediately sent them to a hospital in Maadi, Cairo, where they were examined.
The spies "healthy", and the people's "non-payments" announced by Egypt's Foreign Minister Zoheir Garanna at the airport.
On September 19, the peaks were destroyed on the foot of Mount Ouanat on the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where the territorial safari took part. The group then ran from one of the 35 unknown bazaars to another.
In the group there were 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and a Roman woman) and eight Egyptians: two visitors, four drivers, a border guard and the Egyptian travel agency organized by the Safarite.
According to an Egyptian security officer, a 30-member special commander arrived at the site where two helicopters were directly caught in front of the attackers.
"There was a fire between the teams, the men were killed, the others were killed," said a leader who asked for his name to be heard.
He also said that 150 special classes were sent from the Egyptian Villam Brigade to Sudan, where they were filled with German and Italian commanders.
The current Italian diplomatic leader in Belgrade, Franco Frattini, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
"We need to know that this result could not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our private service people and groups," he said, without further details.
He also refused to pay the tax for the tax.
On the day before, the Sudanese army reported that during the raids, they had been detained by a territory where people were traveling, killing six of them (including the military commander) and arresting two of them.
According to the military, the prosecutors were in contact with a Darfur relief organization with the Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLA-U) which was immediately involved.
Lettres - Culture's "silent majority"
There is a debate about financing culture in the middle of the press and the current electoral campaign.
That's all we can do.
But our cultural life remains a mystery.
Who will take note of the word to highlight the significant amounts of museums, writers, ancient monuments, and national historical monuments that are at the root of the famine?
What political cause is to remind the federal government that it does not care about its works and its cultural heritage?
Or that there are no laws in Quebec or Canada that actually provide effective protection for our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government just translated three and a half million euros to the Chinese castle in Loire?
The Constitution of our fellow States states that the protection of cultural property is part of American culture, and this property must be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and every government body.
In the framework of the Fédération des société d'histoire du Québec (Fédération des Sociététés d'histoire du Québec), the association with cultural property, literature and genetics has more than 40,000 volunteers involved in the research of history, as well as the conservation of large numbers of private archives and archaeological sites, with minimal budgets.
These organizations usually defend our property with a circle of hands and the last part of the globe, when property developers and decision-makers direct their search for our old buildings and buried graves.
When will someone be appointed to protect the historical and cultural heritage?
State fortis bank part of the Benelux government
In particular, the Benelux-States are helping in the face of the continuing impact of the US credit market crisis - first in Europe - on the Belgian-Holiday Bank, Fortison: the three countries support a financial and insurance institution with a total of EUR 11.2 billion in Hungarian interests.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch Government agreed at the highest level on the matter at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's responsibilities for competition.
In the euro area, Fortis banke is the first major crisis in the wake of more than one year of the coming international financial crisis, decisions made in the banking sector can therefore be assessed in a certain way.
On the basis of a decision born on Thursday night, the bank will purchase the property there in close proximity to the three States (49 percent).
The bank certainly sells part of its interests, including, above all, the activities of the Dutch AGN Amrót, mainly insurance companies.
Fortis' shares began to burn last week, and on the second side of the week, serious crises have already occurred with the institution.
Researchers agree, however, that 85 thousand senior employees are too big for the bank to allow them to go into debt.
The company's papers were only five with about 12 percent, 14-year-olds.
Since January, the value of the shares has been reduced by more than two-fold.
The total market value of the group is around EUR 14 billion in terms of the current share rates, but corporate managers say that this is not real.
The company, on the other hand, has raised doubts in the maritime market regarding the acceptance of the US $700 billion package plan for Fortis.
The papers have grown a lot by Friday.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed a new director of the bank's life.
The money agency also sought customers, but no one had ever reported any interest offer.
The Belgian government has already indicated that investors need not rest, they do not lose their money.
There was no panic around the bank's clients, no praise for the boys.
In Hungary, Fortis has self-sustained boys and has also bought leagues.
The rock in the pit
In the United States, health and health insurance companies often refuse to sign a contract with the applicant on the basis of the data on the purchase of medicinal products.
Data protection experts believe that the data market could not be verified.
"There is a data protection programme that is responsible for the use of medicinal products for the purpose of contributing to the person concerned.
This must be done independently, especially in the rock we trust the tobacco" - the founder of Richard Dicke, the developer of the Washington Post program for the follow-up.
The insurance authorities shall rely on the health situation of the present customer on the amount of the insurance fee and the amount of damages, and if they judge too much of the risk, they shall not be bound by insurance.
He was sent to a medical investigation in the past, and the contract was concluded only in the light of the results of the investigation.
Dick has found a lot easier procedure for ten years: it is easy to obtain from the pharmacist based on the customer's identification number what medicines he bought in the last few years, and this program has resulted in what disease he is suffering and what health condition he is in.
For example, if you regularly take a high dose of cholesterol reduction, it is due to the fact that it is practically impossible to treat high blood pressure, which is currently being classified as a high risk category.
The programme also has a number of changes in the market, some of which are also at risk, so it is almost impossible for the provider to remain outside the paperboard, even if it is difficult to replace.
Some medicines may also be used for several purposes, such as injections in migraine or heat waves, but also anti-depression effects.
The latter counts as a significant risk-increasing factor in terms of business assurances, not the previous ones.
In order to obtain and process data, special companies were established, and they were asked to include the patient before receiving the necessary information from the medicines.
They are now obliged by the authorities, even though they have not been punished for their edification.
Some companies are already processing the results of laboratory tests, and they are also linked to the data on medicinal products, so that they can provide a more accurate picture of the health situation of patients.
A number of companies are adding data to the data, and monitoring the use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a special health data law, but it only applies to healthcare providers and insurance providers.
Before the Congress, there is a legislative proposal which also gives the authorities the control court over data-servicing companies.
Dick Richard notes that this is not enough: therefore he further developed his programme, which would be responsible for the data transmission of the data.
Another question is that the person concerned may not accept the contribution, in particular the insurance undertakings shall not be bound by a contract.
And so the tigers are still on the way to the rock well.
Global Marseille Table
The trade between the European Union and India
As with the European Union and India, each other's leading trading partners, this issue is also addressing the agenda of the ninth anniversary of the 1990s, along with the other positive global problem.
Today it's going to be a French Indian village where it's mainly about nuclear cooperation.
The European Union recognises that India is a growing democratic power that should be given greater prominence in international affairs, but that the Member States have not yet been able to reach a common name, to support a new permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This question was not even raised in Marseille yesterday, and it's almost nine years ago.
Mr Sarkozy, President-in-Office of the Union, Mr Barroso, and Chairman of the Commission, Mr Barroso and Mr Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Szing, who agreed that they would double for five years, i.e. hundreds of billions of euros increase trade.
Given that the price increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not too ambitious.
In this respect, it is legally concluded that a double civil aviation agreement with India may be concluded, i.e. air traffic may also arise in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The aim is to balance that while the first number of trading partners in the EU is India, New Delhi is only the ninth place in the EU's partners.
The boy was paying attention to global affairs.
The Afghan and Pakistani situation, as well as terrorism, were subsequently discussed in all its forms, and the UN Conference was called for.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle was also delayed, although both of them had a large share in the educational failure.
The EU confirmed that, in addition to its energy and climate programme, it would want to reduce the emissions of harmful substances by at least half by 2020.
India also agreed that the future climate conference should be linked to a global contract and that the production of greenhouse gases should be measured by five percent by 2050.
I would also like to block the increase in food prices, and I would like to support the integration of international attention to the review of the financial crisis.
Today, the head of the Indian government goes to the capital of France, where the second meeting prepares a business for the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, they are confident that Indian atom reactors will be entrusted with hundreds of billions of euros.
According to the Agency's estimates, the agreement would be 15 years old.
More than three hundred Italian books in Frankfurt
The Italian publishers are represented in a strong field in the Frankfurt International Book.
More than three hundred Italian publishing houses will be present at the most important International Contracting Meeting, for the 60th Buchmesse.
The present Frankfurt International Library awaits 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries, 171,790 square meters, where more than 403,000 books are presented.
On the Olasz Pavilon opening day, the Italian government, Francesco Maria Giro, is represented by the government's location of the Ministry of Cultural Java and Activities: Italy is the same, with a single Italian Pont installation of 264 square metres.
The holiday opening will be followed by a press release in the "Room Structure" of the Pavilion of Buchmesse 5.0, where information, trends and views about the situation of the Italian library are sometimes opened.
According to the data, the Italian spending market continues to decrease the rate of foreign contractors, particularly in the area of adult and adolescent outputs.
Found the lost billionaire, Steve Fossett's plane
The remains of the billion-dollar Steve Fossett airport were found, which appeared on 3 September 2007.
It was located on a 3,000-metre-high summit on the coast of Sierra Nevada, near Mammoth Lakes, which is located in the mountains of California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the aircraft.
John Anderson, a sheriff of Madera, distributed all the remaining doubts: "After finding the airport situation, we sent out a team, and now we can be sure that it's about the machine that Steve Fossett left on the day of his flight," he announced in a press release.
The sheriff further confirmed that no human remains were found in the airport or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-olds were declared dead in February.
The U.S. Safety Authority (NTSB) announced that within a few hours after the discovery of the wreck, an investigation committee was asked to identify the machine and found that it was actually about 8kcab, which appeared on 3 September 2007, on the day Fossset started a three-hour flight from New York.
At last in California, not far from the country border, a couple of Fossett's house near Mammoth Lakes's home.
Two, Fosset's blood certificate, which was issued by the Federal Aviation Agency of Illinois, some cash and a powder.
After a month of disappearance, they gave up their search for shit.
The billionth set up a number of pieces that he wrote himself into history.
In 2002, for six attempts, he was first able to cross the ground by a plane: two weeks of private flight.
Three years later, he flew to the ground without a stay.
A number of records are still in place on the Andok's surface flight, at a height of 15,445 metres, which is completed with a double pilot.
GLK, amplifying advertising
An unusual, yet determined, form world-wide hobbie therapy, with large surfaces and lattices.
In a few words, these are the most recent "compasser" in Mercedes-Benz, with which the German car has tried to bring fresh air to the market.
That is why the traditional content will also make the introduction of the SUV GLK from October 17 to the Mercedes-Benz indicator will also be surprising and unusual.
The same advertising software that tries to introduce a new vehicle is still alive with an unknown media communication tool, including 3D posters that have not been used by a car in Italy.
The gold plate action, which stands at three stages, will take control of the central purchase route of Milano, Corso Comôt until November 15.
This new type of media communication begins at the first stage with the introduction of the driver's coverage, which will be shown in the new SUV, with the help of special features shared around Corso Como, almost in actual sizes and three dimensions.
The viewer of the picture will feel as if the car was lifted out of the plate.
Next, using innovative Elumina8 technology, the new GLK will be visible in a single image.
Without a doubt, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new with this promotion into the stereotype advertising world.
Is it possible to raise the interest of the silent buyers? We'll see.
We'll show who the Italian football team is.
They're probably going to get them out of town.
But who is this 150-200 boys and girls who are now ashamed of all of Italy? The members of the "Ultras Italia" group who have been following the election for years and who, in truth, has not yet caused too much concern.
They've never met the enemy's surgeons.
The team's been working on it.
Chief organizers come from Triventó.
From Verona, Pado, Trieszt and Udin.
These were joined by smaller groups from Campania and Puglia (in fact only a few units).
Olasz had been set up to destroy the city of the sculptors: they were sent out on Saturday so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of English surgeons.
In Bulgaria, they were looking at a real national circus team with the Levski prints.
The Italian Football Federation has apologized 144 tickets for the availability of Italian circuits. They were names, so it was easier to control the team of circuits.
The Ministry of the Interior also checked all of them: there was no one who was involved in the proceedings in Sofia, no one who had been prevented from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian circuits, who have a prize for the robbery, have been denied the ticket and exit.
The Ministry of the Interior is currently waiting for reports from the Slovak police and will then take the necessary measures: those who have been arrested or identified during detention can be sentenced to five years' imprisonment.
It is an international ban, not only on visiting all European stadiums, but also on the Italian side.
So our football team won't be able to put your foot in a single football game.
Good luck.
But we also need to keep in mind the fact that the Hullians are found to follow, that is, that almost one hundred percent of them are associated with others.
"Then you have to catch this fire, you must not stop someone who behaves like this," said the Ministry of the Interior.
So it's better to keep our eyes open, mainly because it's almost Sunday's pick-up day in Lecce.
In Puglia, there is a smaller seed that supports the Italian valleys.
Tomorrow the Supervisory Service will be held, but the Sport Safety Assessment Commission, which may also be responsible for one of the details of the Internal Security Service, will be the secret services dealing with school behaviour.
"Duce-Duce's scandal and imprisonment under the Italian sky? No crime in Bulgaria..."
This thought was expressed in a rather unfortunate way, Domenico Mazzilli, who was named after the Ministry of the Interior for a few weeks (the post of Francesco Tagliente, and before he was arrested by Felice Ferrizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been the chief of police, Triesz, whose town has been working since 2002 with a branch of support for the Ultras Italiana group.
What Mazzilli stands for is not true in Bulgaria to live in Ducét, but from this time on, the behavior of 150-200 circuits was shameful.
I'm not a sociologist, he added the first person to the surveillance service, but the crimes must be handled in the country in which the prosecution is located.
So far, this group hasn't caused any concern, we need to examine exactly what happened and how to make it more important.
But let's talk a little bit about the worship of the Italian god: it's not a crime, but, if I say so freely, it can't be called a virtue..."
