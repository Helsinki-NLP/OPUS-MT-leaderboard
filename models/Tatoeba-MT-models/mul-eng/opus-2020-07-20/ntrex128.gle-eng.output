British amnesia is a matter of concern ‘that any leaves of them’
There is a distinction between some MEPs before the recommendation that it should be changed to MWPs (Bige Parliament’s version).
The exception was due to plans to change the name of the tunnel to the British Parliament of Bige.
AMAMA is convinced throughout the political spectrum that it will be appointed as a cave.
One AM said to the Worker Party that their groups were "that it is mined with Twp and Pwp"
Noted for readers outside of Britain Small: twp means foolish and pwp cac in Britain.
AM told Plaid Cymru that the group was “more than happy” and has given alternative recommendations.
A member of the Defence Party said that his groups had paged under the change of the name, but he noted that there was no difference in the signing between MWP and ‘Muppet’ in English.
In that context, the letter w in Britain is thus called together with the publication of the letter u in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission currently drafting the legislation to introduce the changes to the name, said: "The final decision of any rapporteur on the name of the Assembly is to be taken by the vectors themselves."
The power of the British Big Assembly in The Government of Wales Act 2017 was given to change its name.
The Commission published results with public consultation in the month of June on the proposals in which it received extensive support for the designation of the industry as the British Parliament of Bige.
With regard to the title of the MEPs, the choice of the Commission was the choice of the Members of the British Parliament (WMP - Welsh Parliament Members), but the choice of the MWP was the most supported in public consultation.
It appears that MEPs are recommending alternative options, but the two may be of any opinion to the Chief Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to propose a draft procedure for the changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on the other changes to the way in which the assembly operates, including rules on disqualification of AMs and on the design of the committee system, shall include the legislation.
The MEPs shall receive the final vote on the question of what title to be called upon when they discuss the legislation.
The voting day for the Macedonian majority is in the referendum to change the name of the country
Voters who vote on Sunday shall have the right to change the name of the country to "The Republic of the North Macadón."
Arrangements for the referendum have been made part of your effort to address the long-term conflict with Greece, which also includes five with the name of Macedonia.
The Government in Athens has lived for a long time on the same day as its neighbours from the north and demand for their territories, and has rejected their application for membership with the EU and ECAT.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who was opposed to the referendums on the change in the name, said he would ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, find that the change in name and price to be paid if membership is to be accepted in the EU and ECAT.
St. Martin's clock comes a storm and a storm arrives at the Temple in Harlem
"For historically, the seven weeks I spoke to them say that there was a bar and a church around every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Not one of them is there today."
He said it was understandable the event of the bar.
"People go out in different ways" today, he said.
"The beers are no longer sitting rooms for the public as people go on a regular basis."
In relation to the churches, he is concerned that the money will not take away from the sale of assets as long as leaders wish, "and they will be right back where they started soon or shortly."
Buildings for accidents could come in place of the church, and many of the kinds of people who do not support the plight of foreigners in the neighbourhood.
"People with a kind of skin will be largely the people who buy apartments in such buildings," he said, "and thus they will focus on the whole day that such churches will be destroyed because most of the people who will enter those churches will probably be members of them."
The two chapels were built with a community with a green shape before Harlem became a great city for people with a blue - the metropolitan community in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
In the 1930 ’ s, the native Modhach set out with a white shape.
People with the blue type received the title of the building, a community that was worshiping near hand.
The community took a blue type of St. Martin's under the urram. John Howard Johnson, who was leading a fight against 125th Street retailers, on a large shopping street in Harlem, was opposed to recruiting or raising a blue type.
The building was damaged by fire in 1939, but the parish was commissioned by Father Johnson the bell when they proposed reconstruction plans.
The Army was David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, who is among the "consumer's logos" on the clock.
The expert played the clora in July something else: "cultural storage" and "historical music tool could not be found."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also noticed, that the first watch on the world was on a music with a blue type, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the clora was not much at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's representative was not found.
St. Martin's has been a hard story between scholars and contractors to see over a few months ago, some of the church's lay leaders who introduced some of them, and some of them were the exciting gift that some of them brought in.
The farmer - the control body of the parish itself - wrote to the grant in July concerning its matter of concern "that the grant should be made available for the costs" to the farmer, although the farmers were not involved in the maintenance of the farmers and contractors of the gift.
Some of the peoples of the parish made a slamm under the lack of publicity on the side of the gift.
A 13-year-old child who is breast-feeding in California
A 13-year-old boy shot and screamed at 13-year-old Saturday when he was playing on a glimous home in California on the first day of the glimous meal, said the officers.
The attack occurred just before 7 years ago near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Speaking to KSWB-TV in San Diego, Chad Hammel said that he had been walking with his friends for about half an hour about Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then he joined in there to help his escape.
Hammel said that he at first thought there were only schemes from a decision on ice, and that he understood then “that he was a joke ‘ Take care of it!
I'll take care of it!'
His appearance was all connected to each other," Hammel said when he touched the boy
"I congratulate all people on the journey: 'It's a circus under the road!' said Hammel to him.
The boy was transferred to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego as he is classified to be ill-treated.
I don't know what acid species was responsible for the attack.
Captain of the Larry Giles Garden said at a meeting of information for the media that there has been a drought in the area a few weeks since then, but it was not considered to be a dangerous crop.
Gilles said that serious injuries had been caused by the minor to the upper part of his colony.
The officers walked down the road between Ponto Beach in Casablad and Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and safety purposes.
Gilles indicated that the 135 species were not larger in the area, but most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sciencesbury's is planning to go to a country on the UK scheme market.
Sciencesbury's will be in competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with their scheme passengers on a multi-storey style and special assistant staff.
It is part of the event that does not enter the United Kingdom's scheme market on even £2.8bn, which is still growing although fashion sales and household goods are decreasing, which will test the scheme liabilities more in 11 shops around the country, and will be given to more shops in the next year if it does.
The investment in schemes goods is part of the market's effort to fill space in the holdings in its time-consuming television, microtonnes and household goods.
Sainsbury's said that there was an increase in the number of their two-fold scheme items offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current areas from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with areas such as those found in stores such as Boots.
The whole market is being re-launched its area Boutique will also sell, so that the volume of products will be used by vineyards - which requires more young shoppers.
In addition, the retailer France Shop will be testing permission in his shop with Sainsbury's, which was first opened in Croydon, in the south of London last week; with the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, out in the year.
The directions of online shopping and for buying small amounts of food are daily at local luxury shops by pressing on wholesale markets to make more people jump in.
Mike Coupe, director-in-Office of Sciencesbury's, said that there will be no more services and non-profit products on these sites and the series of shops trying to find an anchor against Aldi and Lidl discount shops.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos places in the hundreds of shops, and they have also introduced some Habits from their purchase of the two series of shops two years ago, which they say they have made a profit about wholesale sales and put the profits of the notes.
An attempt by the previous wholesaler to renew its scheme and pharmaceutical sectors from the ground.
Sainsbury's test was performed with Boots back at the beginning of 2000, but the connection was completed after a section on how to share receipts from the hospitals in their wholesale markets.
This new strategy comes after your Sainsbury's pharmaceutical business with 281 stores sold to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy pharmaceutical series, at £125m, three years ago.
They said Lloyds played a role in the plan, but to add an additional field to the soft brown brands of care that included La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of trade Sciencesbury's, said: "We have been able and directed to change schematic passages from base to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also made investment in specialised associations available for the provision of advice.
Our brand area has been designed to be suitable for all claims, and the mental environment and the comfortable sites mean that we are now the target of excellent schemes with a challenge to the old shopping path."
Peter Jones ‘good’ after Holly Willoughby withdrawn from the market £11 million
The reality Peter Jones left Dragons on Wednesday after the Hollywood Willoughby television show withdrawn from the market £11 million for his business in the lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and HITV
There is no time available at Willoughby for their brand of home goods and adjustments True.
It has been compared to the farm business and the Goop brand with Gwyneth Paltrow..
Instagram, who announced the presenter This Morning, 37 years old, was that she has to go.
Holly Willoughby is after the reality of Peter Jones from Dragons de de paint when she withdrew from her profitable life-style brand business at the last - to focus on their new major contracts with Marks & Spencer and HITV.
Our sources of information said that Jones was ‘ar redbile’ when a white girl admitted the television during a long meeting with Tuesday’s heat at the headquarters of her business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, would no longer have had enough time for her new markets - even more than £1.5 million - to focus on their brands of home goods and adjustments of Truly.
The business was compared to a Goop brand with Gwyneth Paltrow, and it would be doubled to Willoughby wealth, which is estimated to be equal to £11 million.
And Willoughby, 37 years old, notifying Instagram that she was about to move from Truly, Jones came out of Britain with one of his holiday homes as his goal.
The source said: "Truly was leading priorities for Holly.
It would be a long-term future for her to live for decades.
Everyone who was involved in the decision to move out of the market was dismissed.
No one would believe what was happening on Tuesday, gold that was so close to the address.
A trader has a lot of oral goods in the capital in Marlow is willing to sell."
Experts believe that the event of This Morning, one of the most reliable realities of profits in Britain, could cost the company millions due to the non-small investment in the products between causes and continuum and between clothing and household goods, and send further charges to it.
And it could end with friendship that has been seen for some years.
Willoughby and his husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp ten years ago.
Willoughby was established by Truly in conjunction with Capp back in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined as chairman in March.
The two days of vacation go together, and Jones has a 40 per cent foundation in Baldwin television exhibition firm.
Willoughby will become a brand fan for M&S and will participate as representative of Ant McPartlin as I'm A Celebrity host with HITV.
A close source of information for Jones said "We don't deal with matters about their business affairs."
Call 'and then fall into love'
He made a joke about the tax he received from the media about the traffic that would be "non-president" for some people, and that he would be so positive about being the leader of North Korea.
What did President Trump say so much?
Trump and he said that he was a "primary news reporter".
"I didn't think anything."
He noted that Kim showed interest in the second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, on Trump announced it as a major step towards nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
The negotiations under nuclear disarmament have come to an end.
There were more than three months since a preparatory meeting in Singapore in June when the largest speaker told North Korea's North Korea Ri Yong Ho to the world leaders at the N.A. General Assembly last Saturday did not see the North North "responsive answer" from SAM on North Korea's initial efforts towards de-arming.
Instead, it noted that SAM is still exercising powers with the aim of keeping pressure on them.
Trump was very not a servant of his shot.
"It turns out beautifully in the course with the North Korea," he said.
"We used to bring about the conflict with the North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
And now there's a wonderful relationship."
He said that positive results came from his efforts to improve Kim’s relationship – ending the rocket tests, they helped to free him and bring him home from the body of members of the American armed forces.
And he made protection of his unusual approach in the way he speaks about his relationship with Kim.
"It is easy to be so presidential, but instead of being 10,000 people out trying to get permission to enter this floating site, 200 people would stand in a bus," said Trump, referring to the crowd directly before him.
The hundreds of people on the island of Sunshine and Creth Land in India are being met
After the earthquake on Lombok, please provide, where appropriate, a warning to foreign non-governmental organisations that they do not need to be present.
Although not more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population has been expelled from its own area, no national disaster has been announced, which is previously linked to the generation of international aid.
"In many cases the latter said that they have failed not to seek international assistance, and so it is very challenging," said Mr. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children are placing teams together to travel to Palu, the foreign staff is not yet able to begin work on the land.
Mr Sutopo, speaking to the national disaster agency, said that Indian officials were assessing the case in Palu to see the permit for international agencies to contribute to the aid effort.
In the light of the landscape seen in India on a continuous basis, the preparations before nature are terrible.
Although projects were built against tsunamis in Aceh, they are not ordinary seen on any other coast.
The apparent lack of a warning base in Palu, although warning was in force, was contributing to the loss of the number of animals.
Travel between many Indian islands is challenging when it comes to them.
The logistics has become much more complex with natural disasters.
There is a hospital ship located in Lombok to treat the less-favoured landscape going towards Palu, and it will take at least three days to reach the presence of the hurricane.
President Joko Widodo has improved the Indian fragile infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign, and he has spent a great deal of money on roads and railways.
But funding deficits for Joko administration and bringing it under his election the next year.
Mr. Joko has also come under pressure from the continuing sectarian tensions in India, as some of the Muslims have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
There were more than 1,000 people and tens of thousands of people were expelled from their cities when campfires between Christian and Muslim women took place on the streets, and massacres, mobs and soldiers, and other deadly weapons.

The Cromail image within Parliament is the last reminder to be a subject of controversy on ‘rewrite the history’
It would be condemned as a compensation for its complete condemnation of such as the Taliban of many of Shasana's religious cultural gifts under the hands of their symbolic followers or the Puratans about their baptism.
The Cromwell Society put down the advice of the Youth. Crick as "aide" and as "a attempt to re-write the history"
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "I would expect the current debate about the removal of the image that the true Olympics of Cromail came out of the Westminster Palace.
Cromail himself did not order or did the subjugation in Shasana City Wars.
It may be that the abuse of the Cromail would be wrong for the measures which Thomas had taken in the past.
The beautiful fact that William Hamo Thornycroft designed Cromail on the first 19th, and it is part of the story about a person who believes many people even celebrate it.
Mr. Goldsmith for The Sunday Telegraph said: "Many people, perhaps not much in the 19th century or today, under Cromail is a defence of parliament against the external pressure, in this case against the monarchy of course.
It is a historical debate subject that is still the full explanation of the subject itself.
It is quite clear that the conflict from the middle of the 17th century has created the development of our nation since then, and it is a unique individual who serves as a representative of one half of your school.
Even his works as Lord of Defence are to celebrate and also to celebrate."
Killer of Chinese farmer teaches a viciously to die
Farmers attacked and killed pigs within a market in southern China, according to local media reports.
The man with the sword 'Yuan' died with his cut artist, and he was at a table near the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou County, which reported the South China Morning Post last Sunday.
Mushroom farmer preparing to install vaccines in the pigs on 30 May 2005 in Xining in Qinghai, China.
It was reported that he visited his fourth-year-old sister Yunnan last Wednesday with 15 chickens sold at the market.
His neck came four on our side and he was dead, and found out that a pair of doors with a mouse hook near his hand was spread.
He said that there was a big mouse inside the crown with a breath in his mouth.
A federal examination confirmed that the fish made 550 pounds of severe attack on the farmer or that he died, according to the report itself.
"My fourth neck was warm and soft," said the fourth brother with the sword ‘Wu,’ as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
The filming from the security room showed Yuan entered the market at 4.40 C.E. Thursday to feed his pig.
His body came about once not recently.
Yuan is not with or with his fourth body the soul that killed the man.
A market manager told Evening News that the baby was locked in such a way that he would not attack anyone else, and the police were collecting evidence at the scene.
It is reported that Yuan County and the market authorities are in the process of establishing negotiations on compensation for his death.
There are records of cases in which people have been beaten even though they are hungry.
A young woman and her husband were attacked in 2016 by her husband in Massachusetts, and critical rapes took place.
Ten years ago, a mouse of an average of 650 British farmer pounds added to his tractor or that his wife broke the ring to pieces.
After your milk farmer had eaten in Oregon in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told CBS News that it was not normal for butter to be offensive but can taste the powder can be used as ‘sycoke’.
"They only want to have fun.
They treat you with limos, they are real-conscious as animals ... they don't want to feed you.
You must show them full dignity," he said.
A Witness will come to the far south of SAM from the west with Hariricin Rosa
Under the advance, Hariricín Rosa is weakening and moving it across the path more readily out of the north coast of Mexico.
The lands of Rosa will come to rest from a farm in the north of Mexico and south of SAM in the next few days.
Rosa, on Hariricín of Category 1, was this time 85 miles away, as was 5 years ago. The Time of the West of Sunday was 385 miles west of Point Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north from Sunday.
Between us, hearings are coming together across the Pacific and it will turn towards the West Coast of SAM. And Rosa, drawing with the light of the Baja California Sunday as a terrible storm, will start by pressing a global threat from the north into the south of SAM.
Up to 10 oars of vegetables with Rosa will come to parts of Mexico this Monday.
A killer will then be created extensively with the theoretical exposure interacting with the class entering the South for a few days.
Only 1 eagle and 4 eagles of the tree shall be caused by dangerous waves, tsunamis and possibly earthquakes in the forest.
In some places, especially in parts of the south-east Nevada and Arizona, there will be a critical drought due to farm rates rising to 2 to 3 waves per hour.
It is expected that there will be between 2 and 4 deaths in parts of the South, in particular over most of Arizona.
Translations may occur under the conditions of rapid arrival due to the spread of tropical wastes.
It was difficult as a decision to get out of the forest away from the coke with the danger of the tropical environment there.
The vessel may cause massive floods on the banks, and local wind stations and lakes will be set up with the storms.
Some severe deaths will occur with the class entering parts of the coast of California.
The number of deaths could be overcrowded, which could generate minority flows and slow roads accordingly.
The region had the same size as the first female of its six-year-olds.
Some leaves of scattered tropical plants will start with Arizona on Sunday and on Monday, before the baptism will spread more widely to us on Monday and Tuesday.
An owner will cross into the Four Corners on Tuesday and will stay for Wednesday.
The temperature of the gas can be seen in October around the SAM as the Arctic provides, and the theory is waiting for a reasonable temperature.
Amazing changes to the temperature therefore occur over short distances.
An excellent example of the amazing temperature differences will be seen throughout the mid-SAM Sunday.
There will be almost 20 degrees in the temperature between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
After the next few days, the final summer heat will try to recover.
The hot beginning of October is seen in many central and eastern Sam, with the temperature in the 1980s extending beyond the Southern Plains to parts of the North.
80 degrees could be found in New York City on Tuesday, and 10 degrees would be higher than the average temperature.
We are demonstrating in our long-term forecast that there will be a high probability of emissions over the medium to mid-term SAM through the first half of October.
Watched not more than 20 million people listening to Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people looked at the real evidence from the name Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and from the woman who made sexual attacks on her, with the assumption that the attack took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Between us, the political delay continues, with the broadcasters breaking into regular registration for the weekend's final stage: an agreement negotiated with Senator Jeff Flake from Arizona before the FBI to conduct an investigation about the changes that would take place in one week.
Ford told the Seanad Judicial Committee that she is one hundred percent sure that Kavanaugh had rubbed it and it was mixed, and tried to remove some of her clothes at high school parties.
Kavanaugh, in his warm testimony, found that one hundred percent is certain that he didn't happen.
It is unlikely that the 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday looked at it.
This company included CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks on display, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And it is unlikely that some parts of Nielsen are involved in measuring the number of people looking into the offices.
As a comparative measure to him, the number of viewers is the same as the same number for a qualified game in the American hero.
Fox News Channel, which supported its host-visitors strongly with the appointment of Kavanaugh, was advanced among the networks with a mean audience of 5.69 million viewers during the full hearing, said Nielsen.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
The demand was still high after the hearing.
Flake was at the heart of the drama last Friday.
Following the publication of a statement by the Office of the Measuring Republicans that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was arrested by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning at the hearing of the Judges Committee.
He was standing with his eyes about for a few minutes and they spent last time on him, beating CNN.
"Time in my position directly before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in front of the country?
Someone said to him, "the power is lost and the power is small which has many women."
Flake said that his office issued a statement and told him, before the lifting officer had been hit, that he would be more likely to say at the hearing of the committee.
All cable and broadcasting networks were then covered by courses, when the Judicial Committee was to vote on the Kavanaugh nomination for the full Seanad for a vote.
But Flake said he would do so only on the understanding that the FBI had informed us of the complaints against the names this week, which was a minority of the Democrats wanted.
They spoke to their friend, Senator Chris Coons, who located on Blake.
After a conversation with Conons and with some later seniors, Fleke made his decisions.
Fleke was able to choose, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to grant approval to Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation in the allegations regarding Kavanaugh.
The Prime Minister of Britain May informs its customers that they are in the introduction of political games on the Crimeanity
The Prime Minister Theresa May presented his plans for the European Union to launch "political games" in the future of Britain and to engage in national interest and to engage in discussions with the newspaper of Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May comes to the Conference of the Defence Party in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the head of the newspaper on the front page of the newspaper, Boris Johnson urged his attack on his BRATIME plan, or the Chequers plan on which he was given, saying that the proposal would be combined by Britain and the European Union as a "sympathetic" proposal.
Wyde Sims gun: Police capture the suspect Dytheon Simpson under the death of LSU player
The police were suspicious about the death of Wade Sims in a fatal shooting, on a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dytheon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested and registered in prison for the second grade, said Baton Rouge Police Department.
The officers showed a video of the area between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the war.
The police found the mirrors from the scene and said they had received DNA with Simpson, as WAFB reports, clients with CBS.
After asking them Simpson, the police said he admitted a death gun to Wade.
The ban was fixed to him at $350,000, which describes the Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Parish preliminary report was released last Friday, predicting that it was a shooting project in the clock and into the brain of the cause of death.
The department is identifying the police force of the state of Louisiana with regard to fraud, state police crime plant, Southern University police and citizens of the area for assistance with the investigation coming to the arrest.
LSU Deputy director Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcement officer for his "circumcision and integrity in order to execute justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The beginning of 6 rounds of 6 stars grew up in Baton Rouge as a game his father was also filming with LSU.
5.6 points and 2.6 re-examined against the game on the average he found this previous season.
The team was “three times” and “saudiated” with the death of Wade.
"That's in the matter of anxiety in the woods," said Wade.
A short break from last block on Mexico City
The speed is drawing from a Popocatepetl bottle after last encountering right-hand districts of Mexico City.
The National Centre for the Prevention of Tubes was charged to the Mexican community on Saturday to stay clean after the increase in the activity inside the crater, and it registered 183 gas and air supplies within 24 hours.

Catalonian police and separatists have filed reservations prior to the equal day of the vote on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after lodges between exhibitors for the independence and cereb police, and the thousands taking part in competitive exhibitions to celebrate a single day of one year from the Catholic school vote.
A rain-scattered wave with pikes of eggs and a pulverized paint on the cerebs that were being held, which created heavy loads in the streets that would normally be loaded with tourists.
It also went out on the day, and the politicians using their minds to restrict the fight.
For the sake of independence, singing "No Forget, No Forgiveness" was immediately before unifying viewers at the "To the sea of Spain."
The exhibitions reported the local press.
The tenements are still high in the region in which independence is sought for one year after the Madrid referendum of October 1 is deemed to be illegal, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Choose voters to be independent with a high degree, although the percentage that came out with the vote fell among the drums against the elimination of the majority.
According to the Catalan authorities almost 1000 people have been beaten after your police have tried to prevent the vote at voting stations throughout the region with inevitable reservations.
It was blessed in favour of independence after the night of the night to show support for the national policies.
The exhibition went on, but they needed to find a different way.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, said an electrician attending the exhibition of divorces with his wife no longer believed that the Catalunism was gained.
"We see one of the best times we've ever seen.
I saw my parents crying with surprise that they might cast a vote, but we are now appointed," he said.
Despite the fact that Catholic parties in favour of the crucial independence had found it necessary in the regional elections of this December last year, they failed to maintain that continuity in a year with many recognized leaders of their own rank or have been detained waiting for their trial for their role in the organisation of the referendum and the motion for freedom.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the exhibition to support the police on his phone, said the politicians on both sides who maintained the conflict.
"The tension is rising without stopping," he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catholic leaders who have been placed in the barracks since the end of the last year, announced that he would be competing in the elections to the European Parliament the next year.
"From the competition as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to punish the decline in the values of democracy and the foot on the foot from the government of Spain," he said.

Makes Menga score 1-0 for Livingston through Rangers
Dolly Menga was the first to win for Livingston
Livingston was a great victory without opposition over Rangers, and the second was the loss of Steven Gerarrd in 18 games as manager of the society from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga score was the difference in the end and Gary Holt's team came in line with Hibernian in the second place.
He leaves Gerard’s team unconquered from home in the Major Party of the season and confronts them on Hearts, and they have eight points to cover them, this Sunday to us.
Rangers will have a previous home against Rapid Wien in this Sunday Europe series.
Livingston between us with his number of games without losing to it game, and Holt's chief coach still hasn't been hit since he came to the sidewalk of Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston doesn't score chances against mouse visitors
Holt's team should have progressed much before they scored, and had many difficulties with its method just for Rangers.
Bryce Scott Robinson through the line protected towards the back but put his effort through the mouth of the back, and then Alan Lithgow could not just try to find out after he jumped into a fight with the head of Craig Halkett through the back.
The home team was happy to let your Rangers play ahead of them, with the knowledge that damages the visitors from home with the fixed paragraphs.
And it was the way the back swirled.
Rangers took a free cic and created Livingston half-sheans, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson playing together to give Menga an opportunity, which took the ball and scored from the middle of the box.
Rangers was above the possession of the fleet at that time, but they did not fail to break the protective forces of the home team and had no two of Liam Kelly's brothers,
Continued with that story out in the second half, although Kelly would require you to save from Alfredo Morelos.
His step-by-step thrust of Rangers Alan McGregor was the door on Scott Pittman and Lithgow got a flash from another fixed paragraph with Livingston.
Passages came into the Livingston box continuously and cleaned them honestly, and your two claims were rejected by Irish chic - after the Halket challenge of the representative Glenn Middleton, and one on hand.
'Unbelieved Creation' from Livingston - Analysis
Lamont's Alassadair with BBC Scotland by Tony Macaroni Arena
Evidence and excellent result for Livingston.
Each player had improved, violating his belief in this way as follows.
It is a small change in his style and his staff from they came back to the main section, but Holt has to make a big recommendation about how he encourages the team from coming in.
He had so much fun.
The Halkett captain was on the increase, monitoring the royal-organised defenders, and Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept their fleet from the beginning.
A meeting of defences inspired by Rangers is still in progress.
Although they gave amazing proof about Gerard, they came to mind the standards you gave.
The last step was missing--they didn't break through the home team only once--and it's kind of open to Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Welcome to Erdogan in Köln
Minority and blue sky agreement on Saturday (September 29th) and Turkish and German leaders meeting together for breakfast in Berlin.
The last day is the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany - which is designed to repair relations between ECAT constituencies.
Some issues, including human rights, the freedom of the media and the accession of Turkey to the European Union, have arisen between them.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new huge museum.
The largest Turkish population is obtained outside the Turkey itself in that city.
The police mentioned security reasons to prevent the 25,000 group from collecting before the mosque, but many of the supporters came close to looking at their president.
The honour of the hundred exhibitors against Erdogan also - many of them being Kurdish - and they are duly taxing between Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to grant the country a welcome one.
These are the regional objections to the diversity of the visitor, and it is worshiped as a curse by some German tour and is being duly celebrated by others who are not.

Hiiricín Rosa is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with landmines (which may be a benefit to your three-day districts)
It is rare for a terrorist attack on Arizona, but it is likely that this week it will soon occur to us and the energy of Hariricin Rosa on the West Coast, and the risks of landmines.
The National Weather Service issued talks for Monday and Tuesday to Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will take a path directly over Phéonix on Tuesday, and that he will put a garden at night in the morning.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix explained in a statement that there was only “ten tropical cycles that kept their tropical storm status or decreased within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Herrcín was Katrina (1967) within 40 miles from the border of the AZ."
The latest models of the National Centre for Hair is estimated to be 2 inches to 4 yards of fur, and the amounts of up to 6 holes in Mogollon Rim Arizona.
It is like 1 to 2 yards of farmland in other areas of the West West Forest including Central Rockies and The Great Basin, and there may be a total of up to 4 holes.
Because those who are outside the risk of collision now, Rosa’s husband may be a blessing because there is a tragedy in the region.
Although a flood is a serious concern, some of that heritage may be beneficial as it is present in part of the South.
According to a SAM zoom monitor, there is at least a dynamic in direct more than 40 percent of Arizona, the second highest category," reported weather.com.
For the first time, Harircín Rosa captures the Latvian Baja California Mexico.
Rosa, who still has ironic strength on Sunday morning with an attendance of 85 miles this time, 385 miles east of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles this time.
The storm is coming on more water in the Pacific and is thus losing power.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive in Mexico by force of a storm of evenings or Monday night.
The property across parts of Mexico could be very serious, and there is a significant risk of falling because of that.
"A total of 3 to 6 eggs are expected from Baja California to enter the north-west of Sonora, and it could have 10 eggs in question," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then go north through Mexico as a tropical storm before she comes along with Arizona's border early on March as a tropical lake, then going through Arizona and into the south of Utah until late night on March.
"It is the main concern expected from Rosa or its very expensive heritage in California, northern sonora, and Western Sam," says the National Center for Hyrics.

The hundreds are killed by the earthquake, Indian tsunamis and the number killed is increasing
At least 384 people were killed, and many people and large tons were killed by the storms, when the great earthquake and tsunami of the Indian island, Sulawesi, hit the authorities on Saturday.
The hundreds of people came together for a party on the street in the city of Palu Sunday when a ton of up to six metres (18 feet) on the roof fell at night, slamping many of them to death and destroying anything in its way.
The tsunami came after a quake of 7.5 size.
"When the tsunamis arrived early, their activities were still being carried out by people on the street and they did not immediately pass away and so they were killed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the speaker for the Indian disaster relief agency, BNPB, at an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come to itself, he drew with chariots, lions, houses, he beat everything on the ground," said Nugroho, saying that the tsunami had passed through the open sea at 800 kph (497 mph) speeds before he struck the submarine.
Some people went up on a tree to escape from the tsunami and came safe, he said.
About 16,700 people were expelled to 24 places in Palu.
Airfotographs show the agency a lot of buildings and destroyed shops, hard bridges and bridges and water around it.
Follow satellites with the coastal city created on Saturday.
The series of landscapes was found in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indian Agency for Assessment and Implementation (BPPT) said that the energy released by the major earthquake on Friday was about 200 nuclear bomb power dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located at the end of a long queue, may increase the size of the town, he said.
Nugroho reduced the damage as "faring" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels fell.
A number of poor bodies in employment under the shadow of the buildings fell, at session, and he said that 540 people were injured and 29 people were asked.
Nugroho said that the ruins and damage could be more over the 300 km (90 miles) coastal board from the north of Palu, a area called Dongrya, which is closer to the earth’s surface.
Nugroho said "there was no information at all in the messages" from Dongrya.
There are about 300 000 people then living," said the Red Cross in a statement, saying that their staff and freed on the way to beat the places.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could end later," she said.
The agency was severely punished on Saturday because they did not give the information that the tsunami struck Palu, although officials said it had occurred within the time the warning was issued.
In amateur video clips on social media, a man on top floor of buildings can hear and is happy to warn about the noises that were shaking the people on the street below.
Under a few minutes the water wall penetrates the roof, bringing buildings and cars.
The driver could not verify the film part immediately.
The power has been greatly reduced by the earthquake and the tsunamis that cut the communication around Palu, and therefore it was difficult for the authorities to coordinate the landing efforts.
The army started sending cargo planes that had help from Iakarta and other cities, on which the authorities, but needed food and other basics still on their way.
The city airport was reopened for one relief work and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was planning to visit the isolated places in Palú Sunday.
The number of people who were killed in the Indian Union went over 800.
It's quite an eye.
Although World Vision team from Dondrya came safe to the city of Palu, where employees are engaged in opening tarpaulins created in their office, they went over the road, at Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses that were destroyed," said the session.
It's a whole hole.
Even helping groups starting the relief work, many of them complained that some foreign aid workers were being stopped by those who had global expertise traveled to Palu.
In accordance with the Palu regulations, regulations, funding, supplies and provision of staff shall not operate abroad until a disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"But it's still a pitfall at level five," said Aulia Ariani, a speaker for the Indian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "O.K is a national disaster," we can open for international assistance but there is no status yet.
As the second night came in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunamis of Friday, the friends and families of the people still wanted their people to be miracles that make a lot of natural disasters more light.
On Saturday, a little boy was thrown out of the lake.
On Sunday, a woman's free nurse who was in a brainwashing for two days and her mother's body by her side.
Gendon Subbandono, a national para-folling team coach of the Indians, took two of the para-follerators who were seeking for Asian Games, who finished earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr Mandanga also said that his students were among the others who had been appointed by the Roa Roa Hotel.
"If you are raised in the para-failure field, I have my own emotional debt," he said.
Mr. Gendon made it clear that, in the days following the spread of the story about the two-way Hotel in the parallelization community, he sent a message WhatsApp to Palu competitors, who were participating in the street, and went out of his power tree with tasks.
But their messages were only a flash, rather than a pair of blue tickets.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.

AMLO Mexicoo allows no use of the weapon in civil clothing
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said that he would not use military force in civilian clothing and the country in the middle of the 50 years of the lifelong sale in student clothing.
Call Lopez Obrador Détairn at Tlatelolco Plaza "without the common use of the weapon to protect Mexico City."
"Shut up troops on a peaceful exhibition at the beach on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when student movements of the left-hand hero were spreading throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador encouraged support for young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those who are studying and opening more public schools free of charge.
He said that it was due to unemployment and lack of educational opportunities for young people who were attracted to physical drugs.
A.I funding should be increased in two ways
And China is becoming more active in free intelligence, SAM should spend the amount it spends on research in that area of its problems, on the researcher and trainer AI Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The trades follow various parts of the SAM government to make AI notifications, even in the absence of a formal AI strategy at SAM.
Between us, China introduced its last plan: it aims to be in the 1st place in AI innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good start to increase AI research budget by two, taking into account that every other country is much longer than SAM, and we are looking for the next meeting in AI," Lee said.
By increasing the funding under two, the opportunities would also increase the first big meeting of AI in SAM, which was held with the NCB during the discussion this week.
Lee, whose "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" is published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, POF Synoving Ventures, who made investments in one of the AI companies that is head of China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that won the ranked American Othello player, and later he was executive by Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee acknowledged previous technology competitions of the SAM government such as the R & D challenges of the High Research Project Agency and asked what time the other one would be there, to help identify the other visions.
Researchers in SAM often have to work hard to win government grants, according to Lee.
"The China is not bringing away the academic leaders; only the corporate companies," Lee said.
Heads of universities working on AI have been employed in recent years by Facebook, Google and other technology companies.
He said that changes in migration policy could also help SAM to cope with AI's efforts.
"I think that a green card should be offered automatically for PhDnas in AI," Lee said.
The Council of State of China issued its Development Plan on the First Century Free Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation of Natural Science of China provides funding for people at academic institutions such as the view that the National Science Foundation and other government organisations give money to SAM researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, which is Lee.
Earlier in the first year of the SAM Defence Section, which is part of the industry and academic life to participate in, and the White House announced the establishment of a Committee of Intellectual Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million in AI research.
In the meantime, there is no activity in the last few months of the SAM legislation seen by the National Security Commission on the creation of Free Learning.
The Macedonian vote in a referendum on whether or not they will change the name of the country
A vote of the Macedonian citizens in a Sunday referendum on whether they would change their name to "The Republic of the North Macadón" or not," to resolve the ongoing debate with Greece for twenty or thirty years to prevent their bids on membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has five workers in the name of Macedonia, notes that their names are similar to their names and claim on their territory and has prevented their entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments have marketed in June on the basis of the proposed name of gold, but national opponents have national rivals that the change would affect the basis of the ethnicity of the Slavian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum and because of a battalion campaign is questioning whether the number of people voting the 50 per cent will be required so that the referendum will be valid.
The following question was addressed by the referendum: "Are you in favour of NATO and the EU to accept the agreement with Greece?"
The people who support the change in the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are even very much to see entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that came from the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to the future of the country, to the young people in Macedonia so that they will be able to live freely under the shadow of the European Union as it means a safer life for us all," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many Members of Parliament said they would agree with the result of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament was required for the change of name.
The electoral commission said that there were no reports of irregularities under 1 p.m.
However, only 16 per cent of the vote, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I came out to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital city, Skopje.
Minister of Macadón Zoran Zaev, whose wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in favour of the referendum in Mhakadón in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018 on the change in the name of the country in which the way would be resolved to take part in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small platform, and he was drawing up cities in front of a public building of the people who will make a raid on the referendum.
"We are not in favour of NATO and the EU, but we would like to take membership by boat, and not through the service door" Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we do not want to adopt them as Macedonia, we can go to other countries such as China and Russia and be part of the European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO will provide an investment that is very attractive to Macedonia, with a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe a very large majority will be in favour because there are more than 80 per cent of our citizens in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
He said the vote would be "in favour" as "declaration of our future."
In a public opinion published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - pursuant to the number of voters required.
In another public opinion, made by Telifís Telma of Macadón, it was proposed by 57 of the voters to vote on Sunday.
Thus, 70 percent said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to succeed, a number 50 per cent of one vote must vote.
The referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the Government for the West since it took the lead in the last month.

Slogann Trump in West Virginia
The President made a direct reference to the case with regard to his election in the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and talking about the importance of a Republican vote in the medium-term elections.
"Everything we do will be in danger in the month of November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our life.
This is one of the big, big things -- I'm not in my run but I'm really in my run and that's why I'm all over the place fighting for wonderful candidates," he said.
Trump then said, "You see the radical group of cereals, these grains, you see it going right now.
And they are measured on the power to return by using every necessary method, you see the pregnancy, the insurance.
They do not know who they will beg, who they will lay for power and power, that is what they require, power and power, we will not give them."
It is a mission of the Democrats "to reject and stop courses."
"And you see it with four days ago," said the session, giving the Democrats "frozen and green and pure and false."
He made a reference to the Seanad Committee of Judges classing the Senate. Dianne Feinstein, on his name, made the real audience very proud of him.

Uh, uh, it's cad.
I didn't set, uh or, I'm waiting for one--the whole body signal--the worst body signal I've ever seen."
The Labour Party and the wider church are not equal.
They don't accept those who talk out
Although the Momentum activists voted in my local party to tax me, it was no surprise.
After all, I'm the latest person on the Work Party's Facebook page who told me that I'm not welcome in the future - that's all sugar we're talking out.
Almost the same was done with my colleague Joan Ryan because she was badly standing against anti-Semitics.
In my case, I'm taxing the resolution out of agreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of economic responsibility policy, national security, Europe, questions, honestly, has been excluded by Jeremy from previous leaders.
The notice for a Meeting of the Working Party Nottingham West Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be comprehensive and productive."
For a total of eight years as a local worker, that was just as CG meetings were held in the evening.
Unfortunately today, that is not the atmosphere in many of the meetings and has long forgotten the commitment of a "kinder, more mature" policy if it has never really started.
It is always becoming more popular that no different views are adopted in the Working Party and every opinion is considered whether the party's leadership is acceptable or not.
It began soon after Jeremy's leadership, as I had been co-located on my previous appointment that we had a similar political perspective looking forward to adopting a change from base and position that they did not agree otherwise - whether on national security or on the single EU market.
Any hour I speak publicly - and whatever I think - social media will be in a bad mood seeking elections, taxing the politics of the city, telling me that I should not be part of the Labour Party.
And that's not my only experience.
In fact, I know that I am more attractive than some of my colleagues because the traffic is usually addressed to me in political matters.
I am concerned with the professionality and the safety of those associates who must be raised with sexual or racial immorality every day without delay.
One of the most dramatic aspects of this period of politics is the way it is now being adopted at bad levels.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the working Party should promote a culture of relaxation.
The fact is that we do not extend this wider church and with all the resolution "removance" or change of election rules is the party becoming more concerned.
A lot of advice was given to me two years ago by commending me without looking at myself, not talking out too much and then wearing "many rights."
But I did not join the policy to do so.
Since I took membership in the Labour Force 32 years ago as a school student, which had been encouraged by the lack of government of Thatcher who left a room of my comprehensive school falling into a home, I have sought to undertake campaigns for better public services for those who want them - whether as a local adviser or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my policy, including the last election.
It would not seem that anyone in Nottingham East was wrong about my political position and areas I did not agree with about the current leadership.
For those who have promoted the resolution on Friday, the only thing we can do is when the country is moving towards Brexit that will affect families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to increase my time and energy to the leader of the Labour Party.
But really the only message I have with Nottingham Momentum, but it applies to my voters, whether or not they are members of the Labour Force: I am proud to work for them and pledges that will not stop me from acting in a way that will benefit everyone.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: Father goes not to top
Perhaps two of them put the final result on a material plan, but there was no doubt that Father had won this day's Main School game that was very interesting all to win.
They are at the top of the table now, the only team of ten teams that have not finished.
In the end, it was excellent protection, as well as the idea of taking chances, which helped the home team and all the rights of the cook Peter Murchie were satisfied.
"We did try our games so far, but we still don't get tired, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Thank you, Father, they took better chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's in the 14th minute, who saved Frazier Climo, Ayr to begin, but, because of the yellow card of the Albanian player Rory Hughes, who released Warriors for the game, Melrose was able to take advantage of the lines and Jason Baggott won you unscathed.
Father’s initial climate with a penalty cycle, before, just at half-time, he scored and then he won a prize from the front hand to make it 17-5 for Father at the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and with Patrick Anderson's voice, which gained Baggot, the bar was reduced to five points.
There was a long delay because of a serious beating for Rudhi Knott, given from the park on the sign, and from the beginning, Father pushed forward a explosion through Stafford McDowell, who saved Climo.
An active captain of Ayr Blair Mcpherson then received a hit card, and again, Melrose paid the additional man out of an unsecured mouth Bruce Colvine at the end of a period of severe pressure.
The staff came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received a hit card from attack on Climo without the pilot, from the escape of the penalty chic, MacPerson landed on the back of the Ayr rock that was moving to begin.
Climo, as he was doing from almost restarting, survived your Kyle Rowe high chic over David Armstrong's shoulder to collect and he put the backup of Gregor Henry away for the fifth of the home team.
It appears that Still Game stars will go to a new profession in the food industry
It appears that the Still Game Ford Kiernan stars will move to the welcome industry after finding out that it has been designated as the director of a licensed food company.
Ford's party is 56 years old as Jack Jarvis on the BBC play that he is very proud of, that he writes to his brilliant partner for a long time Greg Hemphil and that he is a member of it.
The two announced that their ninth series will be coming down on the last one during the summer, and it seems that Kiernan is planning a life change after Craiglang.
According to official record lists, the Director is Aørømorn Limited.
The operator refused to make a statement about the story, although a source from the Scottish Sun noted that Kiernan was trying to be involved in "a successful food trade" Action."
‘We are the sea’: the Bolaiv has the hope that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
The patrols make a patrol on the head of cables equipped with lines in La Paz.
Ageanghorm brat is on floors on public buildings.
Basements of ships from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are mixed with the manna: "We are the sea from right.
It is a duty to get it back."
Throughout the Bolaive palmythia, a memory of his winterboards has lost against the Sile in a massive battle of resources in the 19th century still shines - as well as the turning point on the Pacific again.
This is likely to be most likely over twenty or thirty years ago, and the Boliviav is waiting for control from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of discussion.
"The Bolaiv has a momentum, a sense of unity and harmony, and of course she is looking forward to the result with positive outlook," says Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian journalist.
Many Bolivians will see the CBI control on large screens across the country, and they suspect that the Tribunal in Haiti will be in favour of the Bolivian demand - after false talks twenty or thirty years ago - that it is the duty of Chile to negotiate and to give the sea a dominant barrier to the Boliviav.
Evo Morales, a member of the Bolivian community, has a controversial battle ahead of him for the re-election of this year - which is also very much dependent on the control of the moon.
"We are very pleased to return to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts do not believe that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia - and it would make little change if it did so.
The United Nations body established in the Netherlands does not have any power to grant the purpose of the Chile, and it ordered it not to determine the outcome of possible talks.
Because the CBI control comes six months after hearing the final arguments "the case was not difficult", said Paz Zárate, a Sileach expert in international law.
And it is not only that the Bolivian cause has been continued, but it may have been put to shame in the four years that went by.
"The current authorities of Bolivia have taken possession of access to the sea," Zárate said.
Any deadly Morales that would have been left by the Sile had an attack.
The Boliviav and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to meet afterwards.
The two embassies have not changed since 1962.
The former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, the representative of Bolivia at the Hague, rejected the idea that the decision of the court was more critical than it is normally.
"A wonderful opportunity to open a new period of relations with Chile" Monday and opportunity will be given to "end of 139 years of agreements with organizations," at a session.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales - still one of the most Latin American presidents who are hungry - was using the question of sea as political support.
"The Boliviav will not lose its customary right to access the Pacific," he also said.
"The rule is a chance to see that we must defeat the history."
North Korea said nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can be trusted in the SAM
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, said that his nation will not initially unarm its nuclear weapons unless he trusts in Washington.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He asked the United States to take action in accordance with their views on the commitments made at a preparatory meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the combat forces.
His talks and his appearance appear to be that SAM State Secretary Mike Pompeo is on a nuclear mission home that was in his position to resume more than three months after a Singapore meeting with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
He said that it was “salling” that continued obstacles and a refusal of SAM to declare the end of the North Korean War would be left in a dry plain.
Washington is highly agreed with the declaration unless Pyongyang does not take the first major disarmament measures.
Kim and President SAM, Donald Trump, would like to have another preparatory meeting.
But there is widespread suspicion that Pyongyang is really about rejecting an army that seems to see the country as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang this month to prepare for another preparatory meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fascinating in Paris shows the latest line in the most advanced measures that are on the way to Great Street near you
If you want your collection to make more heat or block the sun completely, no more search needs to be done.
Discover the designers Valentino and Thom Browne a huge step-by-step area of their SS19 collection on the display platform for their event in application of the style set by Week Faisin Paris.
There was a lot of unpredictable hats showing across Instagram this summer and those designers put their work back on the machine platform.
In the glass visible with Valentino there is a food hat overboard on which is a wide page similar to the beds of the machines’ s logo.
Among other great adaptations were water buckets that followed them, a chandelier hat and even a ring - but they are not designed to keep your hair warm.
Discover Thom Browne selection of strange masks as well-in time for Saturday.
Many of the painted masks were found and they were more like Hannibal Lecter than they were with high quality.
He had one job like a shoedressing equipment, snorkels and snow gloves, and some of them were like a flat upper coat.
And if you follow the great fashion statement, your fate is yours.
It is drawn by style viewers that it may be doing its way at the large bonents of adjoining to the big streets near you.
The great trails soon come after 'La Bomba', the fall path on which page two steps are wide to meet everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural label behind the very unprofessional hat that was being shown across the social media has shown another major work on the machine platform - a housing package which is almost as large as the machine on which the snowflake is carrying it.
The orange oil bag was burned, on which was the correction of raifina French and which had hair bats, the visible piece in the SS19 Jacquemus' La Riviera Week of Paris.
Luke Armitage said to the FC: "I expect heavy heat and bags will come to the major match for this summer - since the designer would have so much impact on it would be difficult to ignore the excellent prospects."
John Edward: Language skills required for ordinary citizens
The independent schools of Albania maintain a witness account of academic infringements, followed in 2018 by another series of excellent examinations, which is strengthened by the success of individuals and everyone together in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
And more than 30,000 students throughout Albania, such schools, which are represented by the Albanian Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), have lost the best level of service for their students and parents.
It is intended for independent schools to prepare their students for additional education and higher education, for their choice and their place as citizens.
As a education sector where we can design and implement a school-specific curriculum, we see that modern languages are popular and that they are a choice of entertainment in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his ear.
If you speak to him in his own language, that goes to his heart."
That is a strong reminder that we cannot rely on English if we want to encourage relations with people from other countries and trust them.
From the latest studies in the year, we see language on top of the series tables with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
68 percent won the total of the students who studied foreign languages A Honorary.
In the data collected from 74 SCIS membership schools, 72 per cent of the high-ranking grade students in Madrid received 72 per cent, and 72 per cent studied German, 69 per cent studied French and 63 per cent also studied Spanish grade A.
This shows that independent schools in Albania are supporting foreign languages as important skills that are absolutely necessary for children and young people out here.
Languages are now viewed as a choice of subjects, such as STEM (technology, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
In a study conducted by the RRA on Employment and Skills Commission in 2014, employers found it difficult to fill vacancies, 17 per cent of which were due to lack of language skills.
Therefore language skills are always more important for preparing young people out here.
And languages that require more potential job opportunities, these skills are necessary in a globalised life.
A small number of people have been selected, if they have the second language, they will have a real advantage here that they have a skill for life like this skill.
By being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a multilingual person will be automatically promoted on the competition group.
According to YourGov survey of more than 4,000 elderly RA in 2013, 75 percent of them had not had the ability to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and the French was the only language they had had a digital percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is important for children today to invest in language learning.
If more than one language is available to children, especially those in developing economies, they will be more likely to get useful employment.
Different languages will be taught in all schools within Albania.
Some schools will focus on contemporary and classical languages and will be taught in other schools of the languages considered to be the most important languages for the RA looking forward to 2020, such as the Mandarin or Japanese.
Such an amount as your child has, there will always be some languages to choose from within independent schools, with a teaching staff of specialists in this field.
The independent schools of Albania are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills they need to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
At this time, in the business environment, language is still important for the future of the country, so that must be reflected in education.
Indeed, languages should really be viewed as "International communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and abuse to young people in Albania.
You need to do it.
John Edward is Director of the Independent Schools Council of Albania.
LeBron will play his first Sunday Lakers game in San Diego
It’s the cool waiting for followers to see LeBron James as the first game for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers' coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the first game of the pre-sense against dinner Nuggets in San Diego.
But the number of minutes it will still play to decide.
"It will be more than one minute and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website."
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, found that James would probably take a limited period of time.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans with a pre-sixed schedule of Lakers".
"There are no pre-sex games at this point in my life profession to prepare," on session.
Time Trip Locking in West Virginia, You Tube Channel
The president, Donald Trump, starts with several evenings at Wheeling, Virginia West.
This is the first of five shots during the coming week, including stops in friendly places, Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to which he has chosen the vacancy in the Supreme Court to remain, Trump intends to receive support for the mid-term elections because it is at risk that the Republicans will lose their power in the Federal Parliament, when votes are cast on 2 November.
When will Virginia Back Trump be shot in the night and how can it be viewed online?
Wheeling at Wheeling, Virginia Back is to be held at 7 p.m. Otter Time, night, Saturday, 29 September, 2018.
You Tube can look at Trump's Log in Virginia Back live online.
It is likely that Trump will speak about the hearings that are taking place in relation to Brett Kavanaugh, who is appointed to the Supreme Court. The hearing of complaints about sexual misconduct. The Senate's certified vote has been postponed for a week as audited by the FBI.
But the main aim of the series of slogans in the week is to come or help Republicans, who have violent competitions, to focus on their campaign.
Thus, President Trump's campaign revealed that these five beatings were during the week to come aimed at "encourage the volunteers and support workers to protect and increase their sizes in the Senate and House of the House of Commons," said Reuters.
"The Conference has the power of its programme to visit as many states as possible and, as the busy season comes to pass," said a speaker of the Trump campaign, who did not give his name, with Reuters.
The night shift is to be with Irene Wesbanco in Wheeling and it could attract support from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get the audience from the media in Pittsburgh," said Metro News, Virginia.
Trip will visit Virginia West, the country that won more than 40 points in 2016, for the second time last month.
Trump is seeking to help a candidate for West Virginia Republic of the Seanad, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the republics.
"It is not good for Morrisey to remember that the President has come to try to make a profit in the republics," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, said Reuters.
Corn Ryder 2018 SAM staff shows that they want to be likely before Sunday's single boutts.
After three reliable sessions, the fourth game of Saturn may have been what was required by this Corn Ryder.
The concept of sport is the speeding up of the monument, but players strongly believe in it, especially at competitions like this.
So, where is the moment now, to them?
"It was a point to begin and now it has been reduced to four points, and so there is a small moment of thought, we say," Jordan Spieth said as he went through the day’s escape.
Europe, of course, has four points to begin and twelve points to move yet.
The Americans are likely, however, and they are very likely, especially because Spieth and Justin Thomas are playing well together during the day and they can argue that they have won by points of four.
Spieth is playing beautifully from house to house and has a good example.
The scoring ship became the higher landing as the battle took place; it found a necessary purpose to win a game of its four, when it was himself and Thomas two men to the end after two races.
The aim he got the game at 15 and let the ships go, the kind you end up with is not lost the competition by an American team.
"You must keep your machine and focus on your own game" said Spieth.
That's what every player has left now.
18 points to be left to search.
The two players, who have more points than Spieth and Thomas, are over the two days spent around Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood and this is the great story of Horn Ryder.
There are four winners of Europeans, who are right but fair and cannot do anything wrong.
They were "Molywood" the only guy who didn't hit night bugs on Saturday, but they also avoided prostitution on Saturday mornings, Friday evenings and the second nine mornings on Friday.
The game does not seem to attract them and the way they get energy from the proud viewers shows that both of them are the players who must win on Sunday; and no player would be more eager to achieve European victory over the sun by Le Golf National or Fleetwood or Molinari.
It would be better if both of them would win at the same time, but at different points.
But it is too soon to be talking about European glory.
He did not take much on Bobba Watson and Webb Simpson to win the victory on Sergio Garcia, the dawn of the four pilots, and Alex Noren, his partner. The Spanish and Dutch were sitting in trouble and could not escape.
The Spaniards and the Dutchs were sitting in a pool and they could not escape after receiving two bottles and two bottles in the nine original pools.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you escape from dust that you have installed yourself there.
The four balls and the four game are so attractive, if they are carefully considered, due to the interaction between the bridges, the advice they offer, the advice they do not give and the way in which strategies change in the direction of the path.
Europe has been better equipped as a team to this point and they have to start well entering the last day, but this fourth game has shown that there is a war on SAM Teams, although some people have doubts, especially in the United States.
Europe has to start 10-6 at the beginning of the last day of Crown Ryder.
Europe will have a good advantage at the beginning of the last day of Corn Ryder after the four balls and the fourth game, when it was to begin with the United States 10-6.
The two inspirations, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, were to begin in the conflict when two were on Tiger Woods, who were fighting, to reach four points to that point by Le Golf National.
The hand was in the upper hand by European team Thomas Bjorn, who was seeking the crown, who lost Hazeltine two years ago again, against an American team that had failed, in the four chariots. He left the series at 3-1.
The American team had a very strong future in the four balls; two games won but it was not safe to reduce the deficiency.
There were eight points required by team Jim Furyk from Sunday's single games to keep the crown.
Fleetwood is the first European glacier to win four points together and is himself and Molinari, on the baptism of ‘Molliwood’ after the weekend, the second pair won four points in the first four games in the history of Horn Ryder.
They had a great victory on Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls and they played both as a unit to win out on Woods, who had a fighter on him, and on Bryson Dechambeau with a better win, with 5 and 4.
Woods showed that he had fought two games on the Saturday, very much now but 19 of 29 games, which he admired, now lost in the four games and in the four games and has seven games after each other now lost.
Justin Rose took a break when the four pilots were running in the morning and he re-enacted with his party, Henrik Stenson, in the four and aquators 2 and 1 games on Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, which is identified as the first horse and third horse in the world.
It was not easy for Europe, however, on a pleasant day, to be taken south from Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won the main competitions three times, and Justin Thomas, placed the standard down for the Americans when two points hit the Saturday.
They won the victory they won badly against Jon Rahm of Spain and Ian Poulter in the four chariots and subsequently to beat Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4 and 3 in the four, although they lost the first two.
It happened only two times in the history of Horn Ryder that a team came back from missing four points in the single competition, although it is not required from Furyk's team but to be on the counter to keep the crown, because the crown is worth this year.
After they have been in the second place for two days, however, it is unlikely that they will be able to make an attack on Sunday.
North Korea says there is ‘no chance’ that they will make a reliable disarmament because of lack of confidence.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said to the United Nations on Saturday that there were continuous obstacles to adding the lack of confidence from the United States and there was no way that the country would raise its nuclear arsenals in these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said to the General Assembly of the United Nations that North Korea has shown "very good" over the past year, in so far as it has stopped nuclear and disarmament trials, it has taken the presence of nuclear tests from one another and because it has not increased nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we see no answer of the same kind from the United States," at the session.
"Without any confidence from the United States, we will not trust our national security and in these circumstances, there is no way that we will make an unanimity disarmament first."
Although a common complaint of North Korea was made again about the United States, which was opposed to the addition of a “one-off” approach to nuclear disarmament, which would allow North Korea, as it took small steps, was important to its statement in so far as it did not refuse to refuse a reliable nuclear disarmament as Pyongyang did at the time.
Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump made a reference to a conference held at the first preparatory meeting between the President of the United States, who was still in office, and North Korea's leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim worked "to achieve nuclear disarmament in the Middle East" while Trump held a conference on North Korea security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the Korean War, 1950-53, but the United States states that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapon in advance.
Washington has rejected an application, as well, to eliminate international nuclear powers on North Korea.
"The United States states that "nuclear disarmament is initially carried out" and increases the pressure on powers to achieve the objective of achieving them in a mutually agreed manner, and calls against "an announcement of war to be around", said Ri.
"The idea that brains can have their ears is thought by people who are ignorant of themselves.
But the problem is that there are obstacles, which continue, adding to our lack of confidence.
There is no reference to another preparatory meeting between Kim and Trump, mentioned by the United Nations earlier in the week by the United Nations.
Instead, the time focused on three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the five months that were about, he also said: "If South Korea was other than the United States party concerned with this issue of nuclear disarmament, the nuclear disarmament of Korea would not be in such a state."
However, the way in which he spoke was very different from this year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was impossible for North Korea rockets to direct the U.S. signatures after your Trip, "Mr. Evil President", "rocket man" on a suicide mission to call Kim.
In the year, at the United Nations, Trump recommended Kim from the mission that he had steps to take to disarm, although he had killed this year to make a “complete elimination” on North Korea. However, he said that much work should be done and that the sanctions would be maintained until North Korea would become nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time for the disarming, saying, "if he takes two years, three or five years - no matter what."
China and the Russians have the right to compensate Pyongyang for the steps taken by the United Nations Security Council.
But Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State of the United States to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday said: "The powers of the Security Council must be enforced strongly and without any failure until nuclear disarmament is fully achieved and certified."
The Security Council has been increasing, for aonghuth, to impose sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to stop funding for Pongyang nuclear and plastic programmes.
Pompeo met Ri at a meeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations and later said he would visit Pyongyang again the month to prepare for the second preparatory meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times a year, but did not succeed in the last visit it gave.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made; but North Korean tax was within a few hours because he "claimed about how to make camels."
North Korea in a meeting with Moon this month would delete a draft, if the United States would take "responsibility measures."
He said Kim told him that the "responsibility measures" he had were more than security commitments made by Trump in Singapore and to build steps to achieve normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to get enough rest.
A new course is started in Harvard University in one year to have more rest at all sub-stages to fight against the enemy culture, which is growing, in which a study is conducted through the night with help from caffeine.'
A student found out that students at the university, who are the first place in the world, have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women, joined the course. He believes this course is the first of this kind in the United States.
He was encouraged to start the course after giving him a talk on the effect of lack of sleep on learning.
At the end of the lesson, a girl came to me and said, "Why didn't I know this before, and I was in my junior year?"
She said that no one had already told her about the importance of sleep--what made me proud,' he said to the Telegraph.
The course, which was made available for the first time in the year, describes the main points of good sleep and the way they help with academic and short-term performance, as well as improving general hygiene.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and an executive director of the university’s medical services, said that the university took the decision to enter the course, when he found out that the student was very tired during the week.
An interactive set of tasks is part of the course of the hour.
In a single section, there is a picture of swanlios, in which students make snowflakes on coffee cups, dishes, training shoes and books to respond to the effects of caffeine and light and the manner in which lack of sleep affects the performance of leisure time and the importance of normality.
In another section, people who take part in the way that can result in long-term sleep loss are said to be at increased risk of heart failure, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a map of the camp is drawn with interactive images, the people who participate in making a look at their daily routine.
‘We know it won’t change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to be aware- of how you should be aware of the health effects that would have on you,' said Professor Czeisler.
There is a culture of greatness that relates to ‘sustaining in your sitting during the night’, he said. Modern technology means the pressure on students, which is actually increasing the lack of sleep as a problem is increasing.
A student should ensure that he has sufficient quality sleep as a ‘secret tool’, which he said, in order to avoid stress, stress and anxiety, even to avoid weight gain, as the lack of sleep of the brain in an emergency mode, as it is regularly affected.
Raymond So, 19 years old, from California, who is studying chemistry and biology, with Professor Czeisler to design the course, helped him make one of his classes during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course was open to his eyes and that he was eager to find a course for the entire campaign.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask every subject of a study programme of the same kind before entering the competitive institution.
The Professor suggested that students should set a time to relax, as well as a time to relax and be aware of the bad effects of ‘green light’ coming from electronic screens and LED lights. They can apply your daily rhythm and create sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's backbone of Gerrard's man
Rangers lost again from home as, because of the shame that Menga found, he beat Steven Gerrard's mediocre team 1-0 at Livingston.
Ibrox was trying to get the first bus out of town, since they won 4-1 at St Johnstone in February. But Gary Holt's team won the second break on Gerard out of 18 games as manager. Therefore, Gerard team has eight points to end on Hearts, the team that is major to start in Premiership Ladbrokes.
Menga beat the back seven minutes before half-time and there was no similarity to Rangers, who had no inspiration, to be opposed.
As long as Rangers falls to the sixth place, Livingston is famous to the third place and is only the difference between them.
There could be more trouble for Rangers, after the online man, Callum Spence, to get medical care in the clock from some material thrown away by the viewer from home, according to appearances.
Gerard made eight changes on the team that easily won Father to find a place in the half-board of Chorn Betfred.
On the other hand, hold Holt the same 11 players, who took a point from Hearts last week and would be very pleased with the way in which a team was trained the fighter.
Perhaps he owned the pilot for most of Rangers but Livingston became more dependent on the owner.
Livingston should have gained a score two minutes later, when Menga made a pass on the bike to Scott Pitman, who gave a cic towards the back of Allan McGregor but went on a train.
Keegan Jacobs took freechick who went to Captain Craig Halkett but did not succeed with his defence party Alan Lithgow with his chic but put him on fire.
Rangers took care of the game, but it showed that they had faith other than faith in the type of practice they had been performing, in the last third part of the game.
Of course Alfredo Morelos thought that he had lost a scar after four hours, when he met Steven Lawless but did not accept the respondent Steven Thomson with a man's petition from Colombia.
Rangers failed to bring only two chicks to the back but there was no difficulty at the backbone of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, to contravene the Lassana Coulibaly and weak cic from Ovie Ejaria.
Although it may have been in the 34th minute Cic Livi against the patron of the winter, it cannot be denied that they were not benefited because they had made a great effort.
Again Rangers failed to deal with a fixed paragraph in the beginnings of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not answer your passport from Declan Gallagher to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and gave his pass to Menga, who put him in the back.
Gerard acted at the blast, when he exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and was immediately influenced by the change as he passed to Morelos, who hit him towards the back but hit Kelly, who had a game over-ticked, from his line to break the ball.
But Livingston continues to attract visitors to play the kind of game they enjoy. Follow Lithgow and Halkett playing the balls up the park again and again.
The Holt team may have a further score towards the end of the game but McGregor stood the right foot to beat Jacobs and brought Lithgow a bullet from a dog who went on a field.
The representative of Rangers, Glenn Middleton, had a demand later when he was cutting Jacobs but again, seen Thomson, the translator, in the other direction.
German: Geiger Guaranteer.
And now a page from our German "Sunday Morning": 30 September, 1882, 136 years ago today ....the day a physicist was saved in the future, Johannes Wilhelm, "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for finding and measuring radiation activity, a miracle from which the device called Geiger Calculator was made.
A basic rock of science since then is Geiger's Assurer. A basic rock of the pop culture, as well as of it. In the 1950s, a film that was produced by Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as stars was there. Although he was not expecting it, it was known as science in the film:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "He's a Geiger Calculator, used to find radioactive minerals as uranium.
When you put these sounds to you, you can hear the effects of the sounds caused by the radiation activity released from the minerals."
Evans: "It is, of course, he's dancing now!"
Geiger was killed in 1945 a few days before his 63rd divorce.
But the layout is still named there.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ breast cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ and kill breast cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify breast cells as part of medical care.
The method applies to the removal of infectious cells from the patient and their transformation into the laboratory.
They can ‘see’ proteins then are common in many cancers and then re-emerging them.
There is a trial vaccine showing potential results in patients, which have different kinds of cancer.
In the case of one woman who received treatment with the vaccine, who teaches the indefinite system how to identify breast cells, the adult cancer lasted for 18 months.
The method applies to the removal of the patient’s immune cells, to change them in the laboratory so that they can produce proteins, which are common in many forms of health, and which are called HER2, to ‘see’ and then to re-use the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that is very sensitive to it."
"Several kinds of cancers" are growing due to HER2, including breast cancer, ubaginal disease, foot-and-mouth disease, defined by Professor Berzofsky.
The same type of approach, in the construction of individual cells from patients and in which “teaching” was made to them how to focus on a cancer cell to treat certain types of leukaemia.
Kanye West began to throw on for Trump, and he wore MAGA Hata after he was on SNL.
He didn't do well.
Kanye West was won in the studio after Saturday Night Live after giving him a free show in which he recommended the United States and President Donald Trump, who would stand for his office in 2020, as he said.
When he was not the third speaker given to Ghost Town, he was wearing MAGA (Make America Great Again). He started at a seminar against the Democrats and reaffirmed that he gave support to Trump.
"I talk so often to a blind person who ends up: 1. How could you give a drink to Trump, not ethnic?
Well, if I were concerned about racism, we had moved from America far away," he said.
The SNL began the show with a lovely scene with Matt Damon, in which Hollywood stars fought under the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Seanad Judicial Committee on allegations of sexual assault, made Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the green man, Chris Rock, made upload on Kanye West column on the social media.
It is not clear whether Rock was trying to argue about West with the post.
In addition, a complaint was made by the audience that he was shouting in the court regarding the action he was taking.
"They make me sick in the castle.
They said, ‘Don’t go out then with that letter to you.’
They've made me crazy!
And then, they say I'm in a low place," said the Washington Examiner.
Follow him: "Do you want to see the low place?" he said "that it would put a superman cup on him as it means you can't give me an order. Do you want the world to move on?
Try out of love."
A victory was made twice, at least because of the things he said and proved that a member of a team was a natural,§§§§ who reported Variety; one person said with the report; "The whole studio was toasted."
West was given to the program as a later representative for the singer Ariana Grande , who was found behind-stoked, the rap artist Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West put a lot of people through the show of the song ‘I Love it’ and set it up as a Perrier Butdel.
The conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner supported the West in this regard: "For one of the most skilled people: Thank you for standing up against the daiscarshlua."
But a program representative, Karen Hunter, asked to say that Kanye West was "as he is and that's amazing."
"But I choose not to compensate a person (the purchase of his music or support his "art") who, in my opinion, accepts and promotes self-science which harms my own people.
It's free.
We're also, "to the rest.
Before the show, the rap singer announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now an official name than Kanye West."
Those of the first artist who changed his name and he follows the example Diddy, called Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy, as well.
The name Snoop Lion is a rap co-founder, Snoop Dog and, of course, the famous artist, Prince, has changed his name to simonyIl and then to the artist given Prince himself.

Star Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, is an attack on her integrity.
Kit Harington is known for the part of the clandestine movement, which he, like Jon Snow, is in the fictional series, medium-decorative ‘Game of Thrones.
But the driver’s tax, which is 31 years old, is said to be stereotypes of the different sex, saying that parts of that kind on the screen mean that young boys often have to be hard enough to be appreciated.
Speaking to 'Sunday Times Culture', Kit said he believes that ‘some sort of wrong thing’ and within it how to deal with the problem related to her superiority over the period of the âToo.
Kit, his wife, agrees on Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, aged 31, as well as recently, feels strongly about dealing with the question.
‘For personally, I strongly feel in the presence of the time - whose mediocre is on the road with excellence?’ he said.
‘What teaching do we teach men when growing up now, in terms of the problems we now see?’
Kit believes that perhaps the television is responsible, point by point, for the increase in her absence, thanks to such qualities that are beyond being varied.
He continues: What is desirable and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets, it informs young boys that they must be sure before they grow up.
I think that's one of the big questions of the city - how do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has been caused by a wrong turn of young men.'
In the conversation, he also admitted that he would not take part in previous stories or follow-up stories, when the series of summers ends with us, saying ‘there are no more horses and horses for him’.
From November, Kit will have a large part in life on True West Sam Shepard. This is a story about a movie actor and a story about our brother, who is in his clothes.
The driver recently told her that it was the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones that he had met his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife on this couch and, therefore, he gave me my children and my future life," he said.
Rose participated in Ygritte, who had the character of Kit, Jon Snow, in love with her in the fantasy series, who won Emma's degree.
The marriage took place in June 2018 in view of Leslie’s family estate in Albania.
Human Immunization Lack (VEID)/Employment Disability Disability Syndrome (SEIF) China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with VEID and SEIF.
Medical officers say the disease is more than 820,000 in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were announced in the second half of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of the new cases were exaggerated by sex, a change from the previous story.
Traditionally, VEID emissions have been achieved through part of China, due to infectious inflammation.
But there is a huge reduction in the number of people who receive VEID as this and, suddenly, anyone is getting this now, said Chinese medical officials in the Yunnan area.
From year to year, however, there are 100,000 increases of the people, who have VEID and SEIF.
It is a cross-cutting issue in the Russian, Irish, Swedish and Chinese communities (LADT) that spreads the VEID through sex.
The lack of immunity in China in 1997, but it is said that there is a wide gap between the LADT people.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies show that 70% -90% of men, who have sex with men, end women, will marry.
Many of the spread of the disease occurs from sexual protection, which is essential in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has been fully available on the VEID package to try to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters reports that a staff member of the GOP's seniors has set up data and appreciates ‘dangerous lies and conspiracy theories’.
United States of America 1. Maxine Waters Tax claims on Saturday that a member of his own staff has sent personal information under three Republican elders in the United States or that the staff member posted the information on Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat reported that the information was being promoted by traders from the ‘real-right issue’ and websites.
"Water, false, and more green" said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
It was reported that home addresses and instant numbers were among the information provided. United States senators, Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information was made available online on Thursday. An unknown person at Capitol Hill was employed during your Seanad panel to examine allegations of sexual misconduct, which were filed against the person, named by the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The information broadcast was sometimes made available after the three seniors were questioned by Kavanaugh.
The IP addresses have been reported to keep sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState that the IP addresses were known to be the source of mail related to the Waters office" and that information about members of the Waters staff reported by the Hill was provided.
"This picture is completely fake," continued Waters.
The staff member - whose identity, personal information and security have been provided, because of these allegations, was neither deceptive nor false - responsible in any way for the issue of this information.
This lie, which is without foundation, is totally false out of the way."
Waters' statement was immediately online. Among the people who were tax was former president of the White House, Ari Fleescher.
"This song is terrible," Fleescher wrote.
This gives understanding that it is not appropriate to be a member of the Conference.
When something is put in place for someone who has not done it, it should not be bad for him.
You should not be challenging.
The accused should not be questioned.
He should be calm and calm.
The similarity was that Fleescher was making a comparison between a Waters response to the Commissioners' tax on Judge Kavanaugh, who put a lot of money in respect of which it was too expensive during the hearing of the people.
A Republican candidate is Omar Navarro who is standing in the election to win a Waters seat in the midterm elections; he also made his views known on Twitter.
"There is a great thing, if it is true," he sighs.
In his statement, Waters said that his office " placed the proper authorities and agencies of law on the information about the false claims.
"We shall make sure that the people who are guilty will be revealed," she continues, "and they will be responsible for their actions, which are incorrigible and dangerous to all members of my staff."
Johnny English is in the start of a business again - scigithris on the spy of Rowan Atkinson without an effective point.
It is now traditional to see if the importance of creativity is in any new film in which British adaptation exists and it appears that this is in this life on the Johnny English licence, which relates to magic in action in green form. It started in 2003 with Johnny English and started snooping again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the language itself be reflected in the pluice, as we are, as a new export right for the nation?
In any case, Johnny English has again received a licence with the Polish eyes to make a prize of courses. His name indicates that there is a genuine character created for the people who attend the painting in the countries that speak English.
There is, of course, not the secret, invisible agent, who has become proud of him, who thinks he is smart, but looks like Clouseau, a mix of Mr. Woman and the person who made one note available for the theme Chariots of Fire at an open ceremony of the Olympics in London in 2012.
It is based from the start of the journey and the international man, a mystery of Atkinson's taking part in Barclaycard television ads at the time, but is now forgotten that he left everything behind.
There are a few good points in this film, the latest JE.
I was very impressed by Johnny English and was walking towards the helicopter as long as he's dressed in the range of the knights of the average and the wheels fighting against his clock at one point.
Atkinson's victory for the body component is visible, but the real-low and excessive grain is, in particular, because brands of film "real" as James Bond and Mission Impossible grains are now available as part of the films.
It appears that the brain is focused on children other than adults, and I myself is not a safophobic Johnny English as a horny and focused character that is in the form of a woman in silent movies of Atkinson.
The basic understanding is now that the Great Britain has a major problem.
A cyber-switcher has crashed into the British spy's secret network and has registered British agents names. This highlights the agent on duty- a very small part, at the same time, for Kevin Eldon.
The battle of the disaster that exists for the main, critical person, who is under pressure; already, there is a complete breach of the people’s agenda: Emma Thompson is rejecting the character, which is like Teresa-May, but cannot do much with the script.
His consultants inform her that every mirror's name is scheduled and that she should get a person, who is absent.
And this is Johnny English ineffective. He is employed, in the presence of time, in a peaceful place, but he is providing classes, in a secret manner, about how to be in your actions under secret. There are some faces here as an English offer or a range of spying of a rock-Cheoul type.
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency information session and it again beats its former partner, Bugh, that Ben Miller is taking that party again.
A married man is now Bugh, married to a manager of a sub-charge, a small mining party, where Vicki Pepperdine is too numerous.
So Batman and Robin, who get all wrong in the Queen's Secret Service, are back in action. They meet with Ophelia Bulletinova, a attractive, beautiful woman, Olga Kurylenko who takes the part.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is in trouble with a multi-technology billionaire who claims that he can solve the problems of Britain's computer. Jason Volta is a Malaysian man and Jake Lacy takes the part.
English and Bough start on an appetizerly platification drive: and they are equipped as servers, they place a free French meal through a fire; they create a bowling ride and they go on a free Volta board, secretly; English creates anarrhythmia, when it tries to use a virtual reality device to use it to inform the inside of Volta house.
They do their seven faults for the last paragraph, but although it is visible and visible, whatever the television of the children is all about.
A lot of measurable material.
And as it is with other films of Johnny English, pass the thought to me: can the British film industry share with Rowan Atkinson, who manages his ability?
The Labour Party submits that it is planning a work week four days for British workers but that they will pay for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn Worker Party is to consider a radical plan, where British will work for four days a week, but they will be paid for five days.
It is reported that the party requires that the leaders of the money bodies, which they will save through the revolution of the free movement (IS), are to the workers in the form of an additional free day.
The end of the week would be three days by the workers--but they would still pay the same.
Sources said that the concept of the Party's economic programme and its plans would ‘end’ in favour of workers.
The Trade Union Conference has agreed with the working week as a way for workers to benefit from the economy, which is changing.
A core source in the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: ‘An opinion is expected to be published before the end of the year.
‘It shall not occur over the night, but a work week of four days is the purpose of which the party is to send to the party for the benefit of the party’s worker and industrial strategy.’
The Labour Party is not the first group to agree with that idea, because of the Blue Party's four-day work week during the event in the 2017 Universal Election.
However, the Labour Party is not generally in agreement with the current objective.
The speaker of the Labour Party said: ‘The party shall not be engaged in a work week four days and the party shall not be deemed to be.’
The Sáth-Shansailler, John McDonnell, took an interest in the Conference of the Labour Party to demonstrate the vision he had of the social revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he had a firm resolution to take power from ‘unnamed directors’ and ‘the burden of profits’ by useful bodies.
The plans of the Scháth-Shansailaire mean that current supervisors in the water bodies do not receive the full share of their share as the labour force government could take ‘reductions’, on the matter that it was otherwise done.
He also confirmed plans to provide places for workers on the board of a body and to create Alleviation Owning Funds and to give employees 10 per cent of the shares in the body, which are capable of obtaining annual dividends of £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy concludes with "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's inquiry about Kavanaugh could change its mind or not.
At least a week has passed on the last vote on its nomination to the Supreme Court due to the FBI's inquiry into complaints against Judge Kavanaugh. It raises the question about the decision of the Bureau and whether public elders might change their mind and withdraw support from the Court.
In a conversation broadcast on Sunday on "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley's responses asked Republican Senators, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could get any information that would change his mind about him.
The appearance of Kennedy was that he had a more open mind than his colleagues had at South Carolina.
"It's about me, of course," said Kennedy.
"Surrender and I are going in to the hearing, dear, I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
Call him after this happened, after the complaint came out and asked him: ‘Did you do it?’
He was firm, unhindered, he did not put pain in it."
However, it seems that Graham's vote is certain.
"I thought I was made up about Brett Kavanaugh and he would take a serious joke, he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but this is what I know: Seven Brett is in the field," said Graham, and he is referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And every person named by her can't ensure it.
He is 36 years old.
I don't think anything new will change."
What is the Year of the Danish Citizens and does he do anything to reduce poverty?
This small Saturday, New York will host the Danish Citizens' Festival, an annual event, which has large stars to say that a party is taking place and a mission is too important, as well: to end poverty.
This is the seventh year of the Dublin Citizens' Festival and thousands of people will draw on the Great Fair in Central Park to enjoy concerts such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also, to draw attention to the purpose of the decision of the procedure, that is, to end real-life by the year 2030.
Enlargement of the Dhamanda Prostitution Project, which began in 2012, is the Dhamanda Citizens' Festival. An international lawyer, who seeks to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are strongly fighting against it, is in the project.
In order to get free tickets for the event (if you are not happy to pay for a VIP ticket) perform some tasks, or "acts" as voluntary work, email to world leaders, phone calls or use any other useful way to spread information about their goal to end poverty.
How successful was the World Citizens and 12 years left to achieve the goal?
The real way is to give free music as a gift to people to hug them for action, or what is there more than another example of such as "the click" - people who think they are making a real difference when they sign online requests or if they send a tweet?
Since 2011, the World Citizens have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from their supporters, who are seeking to promote different objectives.
It says that these actions have helped global leaders to strengthen commitments and promote policies, even more than $37 billion that are to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As early as 2018, the group of 390 commitments and notifications were withdrawn from its actions, at least $10 billion has been donated or collected as part of a money-gathering activity.
The group considers that the money already received had a direct impact on 649 million people around the globe.
Some of the commitments have been made is The Power of Nutrition, a party to investors and people who implement commitments. It is based in the United Kingdom. It is committed to "helping children to develop their resources, according to their abilities" and pledgeing that they will make $35 million in full available to end unemployment in the country after they receive 4700 tweets from Dawanda Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and citizens like you, we can end the social error that is in disinclined," said Tracy Ullman, Ambassador of the Power of Conservation, to the crowd during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said, after more than 5,000 actions have been carried out , which requested the United Kingdom to raise food for mothers and children , the Government of the Fund announced for projects, the Power of the Conservative, which will help 5 million women and children to interact in support.
In response to one of the FAQs on the internet site, which asks the question " why did you make it possible to end us with real flexibility?
A World Citizens replied: "The road will be long, difficult to go forward--from time to time, we will fall and we will fail.
But, like major movements of civil rights and future anti-diversity, we will, as we have more powers together.
Among the performers who will take part in the event in New York, is Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monée. It will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States of America could use the Gulf to carry out "residence" to prevent Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington can use "if necessary" to stop Russian energy being sold in the markets, including the Middle East, including the SA Secretary of State, Ryan Zinke, as mentioned in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke found that Russia is operating in Syria, as it is operating to be invited from the legal government, not a story to inspect new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they do not want to make energy arrangements as they do in Eastern Europe, the least of which is Europe.
And, to the officer, there are always ways to deal with him.
"The United States, with the Wall, has the means to make sure that the open seas are kept, and, if necessary, to carry out missions, to make sure that their energy is not available in the market," he said.
Zinke was talking to the people present at the event, hosted by the Energy Union of Consumers. The Agreement is a non-profit group that gives itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He continues to compare him to Washington’s approach, when dealing with Russia and Iran, indicating that he is together.
The economic choice of Iran and Russia is that, whether small or large, they have an impact on and change them" he said. He referred to Russia as a "no activity site" which was largely dependent on reliable fuels.
The statements, as Trup's government has on a mission to increase the export of natural liquid gas to Europe, coming in place of Russia, are an option that is far more leisure for European consumers.
To that end, government officials of Trump, President Donald Trump, take into account the attempt of Germany to draw out a North Stream 2 pipeline project that is "missed" and, according to Trump, made Moscow of Berlin a "good".
It has often been said by Moscow that one economic project in the North Stream 2 pipe has a cost of $11. It will increase the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters.
The Kremlin strongly opposes Washington for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"We believe that we agree on the opinion that fuel cannot be used as a tool to press and that consumers should be able to select their suppliers," said the Russian Minister for Energy, Aleksandr Novak after the meeting with the United States Energy Secretary in Moscow in September.
A response came from Germany to the position of the United States. It has been reaffirmed by Germany that it will continue with the project.
The main industrial organisation of Germany, the German Industrial Code (CTG) of the United States is requested to remain out of the energy policies of the European Union and from the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third country enters on our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Industrial Council (CTG) after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel and the President of Russia, President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will look at the competition for the Presidency in 2020, says the Senator from Massachusetts.
Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts on Saturday said that she would look "carefully" about going to the competition for the presidency after the mid-term election.
During your meeting in the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would be successful in the competition.
"It is in your time for women to go to Washington to put the government in the right and then include a woman in charge," she said according to 'The Hill'.
After 6 November, I will carefully look at the competition for the presidency."
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the meeting in the town hall, saying he was taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very proud of Donald Trump's effect on our dedication," she said.
Warren Trump Tax and the one he named the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, open.
Speaking about Friday, Warren said "I'm sure we've been audited by the FBI before we vote."
A referendum issued on Thursday showed that a large majority of voters in Warren's voting area were not eligible for competition in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said that it was wrong for the senator to take a position, which was a public decision with the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe.
Thirty gave him one percent of his support to stand in the election.
The audience showed that the former governor, Deval Patrick, had more support. 38 percent supported him to stand and 48% opposed him.
Among the Democrats, who were in the public debate to discuss the position of the presidency in 2020, was the late Vice-President, Joe Biden and the Senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a decision about January, which reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin Non-Smooth Strauss (NSI), who is at Track Palin, is shooting for Donald Trump.
Track Palin, aged 26, was registered in Iraq after being registered in September.
The police arrested him on Sunday night and charged him in the event of family riot.
"My own son has been crying since he came back and I can understand the difficulties of other families with regard to the Intrepid Strus. I understand the trauma of soldiers returning and the disease putting them away," she said to the viewer who shot Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said "the thing no one wants to talk about" about his arrest and said about his son and other soldiers, "they worship and they are different, they are hard, they worship and they question whether the people appreciate what their soldiers and their commanders and all the other members of the army have done, the amount they have done in their home country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and sentenced to family violence against a woman, to submit a report on family grounds and to have possession of all that he had in the past, said Dan Bennettt, spoke for the Department of Police of Wasilla.
18 states support the challenge of the new term policy.
Colombia has 18 states and Districts supporting a legal challenge against the new policies of the United States, which refuses to give a term to couples,z who are suffering from threats or family threats.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a complaint in a panel of court friends on Friday in Washington to support a term candidate, who was making political challenges, reported the NCB News.
The complainant’s full name was not mentioned in the legal case, Grace vs. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union launched in August against the housing policy.
She said that her party "and her alleged sons were members of the dreong," but the officials of the United States refused to accept their application for a term of 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
The solicitors of the state, who were supporting Grace, said that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, many of them seeking a term in the United States, were nations with extensive problems with drugs and family violence.
The new term policy in the United States responded to the 2014 decision, which the Board of Appeal approved the immigrants without documents, which were passing from family borders, to search for a term.
In a statement on Friday, Karl Racine said that the new policy "is independent of twenty or thirty years of state law, residence law, and international law."
In accordance with the law of residence, every claim on land must be considered on particular facts and on the grounds of the claim, and the prohibition now applies to that principle," said the court's friend-in-law.
Further arguments were made by solicitors that the policy, which prevented immigrants, affected the economy of the United States; it was claimed that there was a greater chance that they would be involved and that "the supply of workers was necessary."
The High Commissioner, Jeff Sessions, ordered for German judges without a warrant for obstetricians, who were experiencing family abuse and the end of the droughts, in May.
"There is a deadline available for those who leave their home countries because of discrimination or fear of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions in a statement he made under the policy on 11 June.
He was never concerned that every problem - even every problem - that people have from day to day around the world.
Despite the efforts made in Palu, the number of deaths doubled in the race is increasing in order to reach people who have come safe.
The story was getting more serious for people who came safe.
"Blood of tenancy," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who gave comfort to her little boy, who was impressed by him, at an isolated place in the city of Palu, who was burned to the ground.
"Every minute a body car patient enters.
There is clean water without."
A contact of tenants returning to their homes, which had been destroyed, and which were Porting through personal goods that had flowed away; they wanted to save anything, which was available.
The hundreds were recovered and hospitals, which had been destroyed from the quake 7.5, were unable to deal with it.
Let some of the wounded people, including Dwi Haris, who had their stomach and throat broken, rest outside of the Palu Army Hospital as medical care was being carried on, because powerful remains were still continuing.
He had the permission according to what he spoke about the terrible land floor, the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and his wife.
We had no time to save ourselves.
He was forced into the underworld of the town, I think," said Haris to the Associated Press, explaining that his children were in the big town for marriage.
"I called my wife a kiss for help, but then everything was a toast.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe, safe."
The Ambassador of the United States is proud of China with ‘polluting notifications.
A week after your Chinese official newspaper posted a four-page notice in a daily newspaper in the United States, the United States Ambassador sent China to Beijing that China was using American newspapers to expand polling.
The United States. Last Wednesday, President Donald Trump made a reference to the supplement in the Des Moines Register - the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa - paid by China Daily - after sending him to China that she tried to introduce the elections of the conference on 6 November. China filed the charge.
A Trump case revealed that Beijing was seeking to introduce the United States elections to a new stage in the campaign, which was being increased by Washington to pressure China, said officials of the United States to Reuters.
While it is common for governments to use notifications to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are engaged in a trade war, which is increasing, currently and, as a result, have both been placed on their imports.
China has quickly taken countermeasures in the trade war to win a victory against a state like Iowa, which has supported a Trip Republical Party, including Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, Ambassador of the United States to China and a person who is behind the governor of Iowa, who exports most agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had been following the recruitment of American workers, farmers and business.
The China has "used to use that embezzlement by sending polling notices in American free newspapers" written Branstad in an article that expressed his views in the Sunday news of the Des Moines Register.
"The Chinese government is using American tradition that we have permission to speak and freedom at the price to spread its polling part, when it sends notifications, which it pays out in the Des Moines Register.
"In contrast, you will not hear a lot of unusual voices at the news station down here in Beijing. You will not see the various views that the Chinese people may have about the economic policy of China, which is remote, because the media are under the power of a Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He continued: "One of China's major newspapers offered to publish his section," although he did not mention the newspaper.
Publishing Ban Voters prior to the Central-Term Elections with the Kavanaugh Case, which was the subject of analysis.
As a large Republican majority stands to say in relation to and protecting nominations to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, despite some allegations of sexual assaults have been made, analysts have made a duty to respond, particularly from women during the midterm election, which is on the barriers.
People are very upset about this and the majority of the Republicans have already said that they need to proceed with a vote.
"These things can't be stopped," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse with ‘The Hill’ for a section published on the Saturday.
Reeher said that he wondered whether it would be enough to try to reach out to senior voters by Senator Jeff Flake (Republic- Arizona), who was trying to get the latest moment of FBI inspection.
Women will not forget what happened - they will not forget it tomorrow and they will not forget it in the summer," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and speaker for the MoveOn supply group, on Friday, with the newspaper in Washington D.C.
On Friday Friday this phrase "We are going to come!" was heard by the protesters as they did their presentation in the Seanad Hall. The Republicans, who had the power of the Judges Committee, decided to proceed with the name Kavanaugh despite the evidence provided by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who reported Mic. 2.
There will be an increase in democracy's dissidents and it will be very encouraging to them," said Stu Rothenberg, an open political analysis, with the news site.
"People are saying it is high, already; it is true.
But it could be higher, especially among women who are between two councils, in urban towns and younger voters, persons between 18 and 29 who do not like the President but do not vote.
Even before public evidence for Ford, whose allegations of sexual assault against the names of the Supreme Court had been made by an analyst that there could be a counter-response, if Republicans continued to promote it to certify the names.
"This is a phrase that is fundamental to the GOP," said Michael Steele, Vice-President of the National Committee of the Republics at the beginning of last week, which is based on the NBC News.
"It does not apply to the only committee or the last vote or whether Kavanagh is appointed on the tribunal or not, it also applies to the way in which this Republic is dealt with and the way in which it is treated," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Muslims.
However, it appears that there is a school between Americans, which of the two they believe after Ford and Kavanaugh witnesses and believe more of them as kavanaugh.
A new public opinion shows that 41 percent of respondents believe fully or not to be completely proof Ford and 35 percent of respondents said that Kavanaugh's witness is either completely or totally wrong.
In addition, 38 percent of them said that they believed, entirely or totally not, that Kavanaugh said false as part of all evidence that 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After the pressure placed by Flake, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as another prosecutor, at least Deborah Ramirez, who reported the Guardian.
Ford gave evidence to the Seanad Committee of Judges of the past week that Kavanaugh was attacked and affected by the oil, when she was seventeen years old.
Ramirez felt that the names of the Supreme Court were revealed by her gender, when she was present at the time when two of her students were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The person has plans to send the New World Network to Google and Facebook challenges.
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the Dmonda Network, is to start a new initiative, which will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project from the famous technician, Inrupt, is the body that takes on the open source platform Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose the location where they store their data, and the persons allowed to access that information.
In an exclusive conversation with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said, with shame, that the desire that is behind the Inrupt is “world reform.”
"Let's do it now," he said about the initiative.
"It's a historic moment."
The IP uses Solid technology to give people an opportunity to create "his personal data store, online" or create POD.
Contact details, list of things to be done, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools can be found.
It is about how Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would all be available on one browser and all at the same time.
The particular thing about the online personal data store is that under one user it has access to a person, who has a particular type of information.
The body gives: "personal capacity through data."
the idea of Inrupt, which is given to the Chief Executive, John Bruce, is to provide the appropriate resources, processes and skills so that solid is available to everyone.
The body is currently the Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers on the staff, who have a contract to work on the project and community of volunteer coders.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers around the world could create their destabilized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he was not himself or his staff talking to "Facebook and Google about making a complete change or not introducing it in which the business models they were convinced would be based overnight.
"We're not looking for permission."
In posting on Medium, published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "mission of Inrupt or commercial and environmental energy is to provide, to help protect the intrusion and standards of the new network, built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee made changes on the basis of the Internet, when he established the Dmounda network at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
With a few months ago, a voice, which has an impact on the debate about the neutrality of the Internet, which was in Berners-Lee.
Even when Inrupt is running, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the Global Network Coherence, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm more likely to be over the next period of the Internet," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Clerk celebrates Cross Victoria in World War 1.
His home has been celebrated by a clergyman in the Shasana Church, the only clergyman who won Cross Victoria during World War I as a hero.
The Lieutenant Colonel, Bernard Vann, won the rank on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglesi and Lehacourt.
But a nurse died four days later and he never knew that the grade was high in the British army he won.
Discover two monumental stones at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his charms, Michael Vann said that there was “a wonderful coincidence” that the stone would reveal 100 years directly from the victory of his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette on 28 September 1918, the Lieutenant Colonel Vann directed his death through the Canal of Saint-Quentin "by a heavy and violent attack from park and measles."
Then he broke up to the gunmen's line and with "excellent courage" he directed the line to start before he drove on a park front and put three of the damage.
A German relative died on 4 October 1918 - a month before the end of the World War.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that his actions were old-fashioned as "that we can never do but what goes to my heart."
He put himself and his brother, Dr. James Vann after the parade, which was the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he thought it was a great honor to take part in the parade" and he also said that a missionary who had shown real-life was expressing support to many people."
IMMA followers stayed in their seats for the night to watch Bellator 206 but, instead, Peppa Pig's receiver.
Simulate this, you have enjoyed sitting in your sitting for the night to look at Bellator 206, which is very good but you don’t look at the main event.
There were 13 waves on the list of battles from San Jose, it was on the main list and it was showing in a live broadcast through the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At its 6am, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory Mac Donald were preparing to meet together, a beating of viewers in the United Kingdom was lifted when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people were not too drunk to sit in their seats until the early morning to see the fight.
One follow-up gave "back" the change to children's cartoons on Twitter.
"The government regulation was not the appropriate programme and, therefore, they had a programme change for children," said Dave Schwartz, senior President of Bellator, who was in charge of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Everyone's kids, she's her."
President Bellator, Scott Cooker said they will work on the schedule to provide cover for the UK audiences in the future.
"I think, when I think about the repeat that we can work it out," Koker said.
"But it is its clock on Sunday morning and we will not be able to work this out until the time here on Sunday and then on Monday.
But we want to fix it.
I believe it, when the program changed then, there were many texts going and anal and not all friendly.
We wanted to solve it, we thought there was a technical problem.
But she did not, a question of government.
I can give you a commitment that won't happen the next time.
We set up five boats other than he - as we usually do - and we tried to make the truck available to the trailers and we stayed too long.
There is a terrible situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley thought 'bad' because of his sex.
The Olympic champion, Tom Daley, says that he felt that he was not as well with others when he was growing up because of his sex--but he gave that incentive to make progress.
The man who is 24 years old says he didn't understand until he went to high school "not everyone was like me."
And speaking of the first Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, which was presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the rights of air people to give “darkness” to others.
He also said that he was a parent now that it was not so important for him to win the Olympics.
The usual player on the show, Kirsty Young, has been building for a few months because of illness.
And on the first Laverne program as a person on a abandoned island, Daley said that he viewed himself as a "lower" than everyone else, when he was growing up as "no better than social acceptance that boys and girls were attracted to a person."
He said: “To this day, those feelings are that I felt myself as a person who was less and different, those are certain things that have given me the power and the strength to be able to accomplish things.”
He wanted to prove that he had a ‘something’, he said, so that he would not be demobilized by everyone, when he finally got out of his sex.
The person who has won two prizes in the Olympics is now a campaigner, who is in the public language, for LADT(Leispical, Air, Sexual and Transnisce). He was interested in being present at the British Association Games in Australia in an annual year to request more countries to distort the sovereignty.
He said that he spoke out as he felt that his condition was able to live openly without any influence and that he wanted to give others a “right” to him.
Daley, who had been a worldwide move three times, said that when he fell in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, he met him in 2013.
Daley's winner Oscar, 20 years older than last but he said there was no problem with the gap between ages.
"When you cry so much at a very young age" - he went to the Olympic Games, at first, when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult for a person to get his balance that was so many above to live his life.
The couple are parents from the month of June. Their son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, said Daley was "the whole view of life" after a change.
"If this year's question asked me what was important, it all happened with 'a gold ring to win'," he said.
"Do you know, things are more important than gold Olympics.
Robbie is my gold base of Olympics."
His father, Robert, died in 2011 at the age of 40 when he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley did not accept his father that he was to die and one of the last things he asked was their ticket to London Olympics in 2012 - because he wanted to be in the early series.
"We can't tell her you won't be around to be in the first row, Dad," on session.
"I had a hand grip on him when he stopped swallowing and I didn't admit he wasn't locked up until he stopped swallowing and he was dead," he said.
The year before, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a solid foundation.
"I knew that was the dream I had in my life - sitting in front of a crowd at the Olympic Games, there could not be a better feeling," he said.
He expressed his first choice of songs, as well as - Proud with Heather Small - who went into operation in preparations for the Olympics and still gets excited.

Mickelson, who is not exercising right on behalf of the representatives in Corn Ryder on Saturday.
The American fill-in item will be reached by Phil Mickelson on Sunday when he plays in a game in Corn Ryder for the 47th time, but it will improve their performance, if he thinks it will not be a mission event for him.
Jim Furyk, the captain, Mickelson, brought to the tribunal the replacements for four balls and four games on the Saturday. Mickelson was playing in the annual competition for the 12th time, paragraph finished.
Despite being in the middle of the competitions, as it was often for the United States, the Department of Mickelson, which he had won five major competitions, his time as a recommendor and practicing his career in the area and he hoped that he could solve such a problem that he had been putting out of it.
He was never able to hit the ball directly, even when he was in his best grip, the player is not 48 years old enough for the whole race of kungk Le Golf National, as the long-term hero usually removes the balls that go on the street.
And if the course itself is not quite difficult, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, will be in competition with the precise launch of the British Open Competition, Francesco Molinari, who has Tommy Fleetwood, who is his first year of career, his party and whose four games have won this week.
If the Americans have a good start, which is four points to end at the start of the 12 single game, the Mickelson game may be too important.
Furyk showed that he was confident of it, but he could not say anything else.
"He fully understood the part he had here today, he commended me and said that he would be ready for the evening," said Furyk.
"He is very confident of himself.
He is a very experienced person in his time around, and he added that to this staff at his time around, and for this week.
I probably didn't like it playing two games.
I illustrated more, but that's the way he worked out and we thought that was the direction we had to move.
He wants to be out there like everyone else.
Mickelson will save Nick Faldo's courage for the person who plays the biggest number of games on Sunday.
It may end up informing you that it has never been as well with its personal effort.
Mickelson has 18 feet, 20 which he lost and seven heads he divided, although Furyk said there were some health-related things for the staff because it was there.
"It's funny, helpful, positive, it's good to be out of people and it's a great person in the staff room," he explained.
"I think that the young sports players had gone to be jumping off, too, this week, which he was curious to see.
It makes more than the play available."
Thomas Bjorn realizes that a large increase can occur without delay.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, has known from his experience that a good grower can start the last day of the single games in Corn Ryder a hard day to create.
For the first time in the game 1997 by Valderrama, as a team under his captain, Seve Ballesteros had five points to begin with the Americans but only on a requirement that is due to the smallest woman among them, 1411⁄2-131/2.
"You keep reminding yourself that Valderrama had a great farm; we had a big farm at Brooklyn, where we lost and Valderrama, when we grew up, but suddenly," says Bjorn, who is in the picture after he was looking at Range 2018 at 5-3 on Friday and again could have started 10-6 by Le Golf National.
So, the story will tell me and for everyone who isn't around.
one hundred per cent ammary.
Get out then and finish the right things.
This is not about the points on the board.
We have a goal and that is this corner to win, and watch the focus then.
I have already said, in particular the 12 players on our team, but we well know who is on the other side - the best players on the world."
Bjorn had a smile on his way to play his players and he said: "We don't read too much in there.
It's a very early day.
Most likely the way each player will create is and there is a different thing to do.
It’s great to be out there with a party, when courses are going well, but when you’re out there alone, then try your own resources as an asset.
That's the message you have to apply to the players, that is to play on your magic skills.
Now, you leave your party behind and those who play at the top of their suit, as well."
In contrast with Bjorn, Jim Furyk will be able to play his players better as individual players than they play with their partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won by four points.
Furyk has experienced both the results of major changes on the last day because he was a member of the staff who won at Brooklyn and then became a member of the team who lost, when Europe came out of the "Murified by Medinah".
"I remember every word of it," he said in response when asked a question about Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 and how he touched his players at the beginning of the last day.
"We have 12 important games to watch but you would like to start well as you see at Brooklyn and Medinah.
When that energy goes on one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the games in the middle of members.
We set up our team so and we set out the players as we were, you know, to create some magic."
Thomas's care is to show leadership in the future and Rory McIlroy is against the main game and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans in the first half of the day.
"I met with this group of men as I thought they would be good for the whole day," Bjorn said about his options for the single games.
The German warship is restored.
A commission should be made in 2014 on the latest flagship of the German Navy to arrive at the place of the warship from the time of the Cold War. But it will not happen to us this year, due to the increasing fraud and cost of the local media.
The commission of the "Rhineland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuertemberg frigate, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, as told by the newspaper Die Zeit, who mentioned military talks.
The ship should be part of the Gulf in 2014 , but there were major after-delivery problems stemming largely from the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuertemberg ships, ordered by the Naval in 2007, will be arriving at Bremen's cool place, which is growing old.
It has been given to understand that it will have an all-powerful cannon, a mix of aircraft and cargo-ship pumps, as well as thermal technology such as reduced radar, infrared and coastal signatures.
Other important features are longer periods of maintenance - it may be possible to prepare the latest frigates for two years out of home port.
But, because there was a continuous delay, it means that the main warships - which would give power to be displayed abroad - from a date under which they will be ready, says Di Zeit.
The frigate was unafraid in the last news, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and sent it back to the Bloom & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the ship was sent back to the builder after receiving it.
There was little knowledge about the reasons why the ship was returned, but the German media mentioned some "bests on software and hardware" if it would not be awarded on a fight mission.
There were shortcomings in the software too important because an army of the Baden-Wuertemberg type will be operating by a staff of 120 marines - half of the staff that was on older brakes of the Bremen type.
Also, it came to light that the ship is too far, that this reduces the operation of the ship and limits the resources of the Navy to upgrade in the future.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz", which has a weight of 7,000 tons, is twice as heavy as ships of the same kind used by Germany in the Second World War.
While much of heavy goods are profitable, the cost of the project is the entire cost of training the staff in particular - and remote exits.
The cost is said to be increased to €3.1 billion ($3.6)-increased from €2.2 billion at the beginning.
The newest challenge is the recent slowdown in Germany's military power.
Earlier in the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy was "and passed from ships they could escape."
The officer said that the question had been raised over the years because ex-ship decommissioned but no new ships had been made available.
He complained that none of the frigates of the kind Baden-Wuertemberg could be part of the Castle.
The National Trust has a backlog on the secret life of bats.
A new research is being carried out on estate in the territories of Albania and is aimed at finding out the way the bat boat uses the country's side to make debt for food.
It is expected that the results will need new light on the conduct of the unique flight mask and will help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study of the scientists at the National Trust of Albania will continue to include comounted bats and soprano pipistrelles, as well as Daubenton bats at the Inverwe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special records shall be sent to special sites around the estate to follow the activities of the bats during the season.
The staff of the National Health Service (SSN) shall carry out mobile inspections using hand-helds.
A sound analysis of each record, made by experts, will reveal the frequency of calls made by bats and what each species does.
An agricultural map shall be made and a description of the record of its conduct shall be shown in a large picture of the land.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant of the nature of the Albanian National Trust, hopes that the results of the natural areas will be the most important for bats and the way each species uses them.
This information will help to illustrate the benefits of genetic management such as the creation of a motor vehicle and how best to preserve soil for bats and other species concerned.
The number of bats in Albania and throughout the United Kingdom has been greatly reduced over the past hundred years.
They are benefiting from building and development work that brings out their crops and crops that are lost.
Wind turbines and lightning can be dangerous as scrap paper and some chemical treatments on construction materials, as well as pumps that make cat pets.
There's no blind bats, really.
Because of their sleep patterns in the night, however, their movement is more useful than their eyes, when they decide on creaking matter.
They find devices and bats in their hives from small, sophisticated technique.
The National Trust of Albania, responsible for providing additional care and 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is indeed under bats.
He has trained tens of experts, who regularly survey the fields and sometimes do research.
The organisation has established a separate term for bats, the first and only in Albania, at the Treve estate in Dumfries and Galloway. It is home to eight of the ten species of bats in Albania.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says that the estate is their best district.
"We are a great area for bats here at Treve" he said.
"We have the old buildings, many old trees and gardens.
But there are many about bats we don't know yet, and so the work we do here and at other estates will help us to understand the things they have in a way that will be successful."
It stresses the importance of checking for bats, prior to maintenance of buildings and residential places, as if destroyed with single motherhood, it could up to 400 female bats, young bats and, possibly, the entire bats in that area.
bats are protected and it is against the law to kill them, enter them, destroy their wings or their feet.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an Albanian officer of the Conservative Trust of the Leather Shipyard, is in charge of providing assistance to the public.
She said: “We are still learning about our bats and, in the case of many of the species we have, we do not know how they come from the whole communities.
Ronaldo condemns the discrimination against him as legislators on the house of law report in German.
Cristian Ronaldo has been baptized after his baptism as a "refuge," saying that people "need to give themselves a public" by taking an interest in his name.
His lawyers are on the house of law to build against German news reports, Der Spiegel, which publishes the allegations.
The beginnings of the Portuguese and Juventus have been compared to that of an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, who worked in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It appears that he then gave $375,000 to keep her quiet about the event, said Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking to him about an Instagram live video with his followers several hours after reporting the allegations, Ronaldo, 33 years old, began the reports and gave them a "false" report.
"No good, no good, no good, no good.
What has been said today is a lie, "the person who won the Ballon's Or five times and he's talking in the room.
‘They need to promote themselves by using my name.
It's natural.
They need to be famous, when they mention my name, but it is part of the job.
I am a happy person and everything is good," said the player and a minor to him.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to take a legal case against Der Spiegel under the allegations. They gave "unacceptable reports of doubt in the privacy field," he, said Reuters.
The lawyer, Christian Schertz, said that the player was seeking compensation for "damages, at a level that is due to the serious cause of the disorder, which is probably one of the worst violations of personal rights in recent years."
The event appears to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meetings at night club, Ronaldo and Maorga are reported back to the player's room as he signed to him, who is missing, with papers held by the County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo came to his generation after the alleged event and that he said he was "99 per cent" well but that the "one per cent" let him down.
The documents require that Ronaldo admitted that both of them had sex but that there was a combination of sex.
Maorga also claims that she went to the police and that she took photos of her tormentors at the hospital but that she agreed to an arrangement outside the court because she was "sanned that a sale would take place" and that she believed "that she would be born before the public."
The woman, 34 years old, says she is trying to cancel the arrangement as she is always very aware of the alleged event.
Ronaldo was on his way to Real Madrid from Manchester United, when the alleged event took place, and this summer, he moved to a large club, Juve, in order to make up €100 million.
Breathing: The United Kingdom would be ‘dwelling’ if it lost car manufacturers.
The United Kingdom would have ‘donely’, if it had lost its status as a world leader in the manufacture of a car after the Creation, said to Greg Clark, Secretary of Business.
He said that "a cause of concern" said Toyota RA to the ECB that the UK would leave without a solution, that it would stop the production of a car at its factory at Burnaston, near Derby.
"We have a solution," said Mr. Clark.
The manufacturer of a Japanese car said that posts could have been lost, if the limit had been delayed, in the absence of a solution under the Bratisty.
Burnaston factory - which makes the Toyota Auris and Avenis - more than 150,000 trucks have been exported and 90% of them have been exported to the other part of the European Union.
"My opinion is, if Britain leaves the European Union without a solution at the end of March that the production of a car will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers have said they are desperate for an EU event without a solution regarding the way the cross-border trade will operate; among them are Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after the Creation.
The main barriers to vehicle manufacturers are the risks associated with the supply chains in the event that the Breath has become unsolved.
Toyota production line works "directly in time". Parts from suppliers in the United Kingdom and the EU come every 37 minutes for an order-made car.
If the United Kingdom leaves no solution on 29 March, the limit may be introduced, and the industry may be delayed and failed as a result, says the industry.
It would not be possible for Toyota to keep more than a day's distance at Derbyshire factories, said the body, and thus, production would stop.
Mr. Clark said that the Chequers Theresa May plan "has been made precisely to avoid this delay at the border."
"We must have a solution. We need the best solution, not only that will allow us to continue our success, but that we will succeed," he said to the BBC.
"The evidence we have from Toyota and other manufacturers is that we are able to continue with the supply chains, which are very successful at present."
Toyota was unable to tell how long the production would take place, but in the long term, he said that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and that posts would eventually be lost.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is a producer of the United trade union in the factory. He said that his members were worried about increasing. "In my experience when these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government speaker said: "We have a plan, accurate and reliable, provided for the EU's relationship in the future."
The meeting between Trump and the White House, says the White House.
Donald Trump's important meeting with the Deputy High Commissioner could be "repatriated for another week" as the fight under the names of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special lawyers, Robert Mueller, who is inspecting Russia's entry into the election, relations between Trup experts and the possibility that the court was blocked by the president.
Whether Trump will break the high-frequency gap or not and thus endanger Mueller's independence is the background to be heard in Washington for the last few months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed spending a row to record talks with Trump and the chance that the president could be removed from office by the mid-25th amendment.
Shean Rosenstein's description.
But he went to the White House this past Monday and the story outside that he was leaving his post.
On the contrary, it was announced that a meeting on Thursday with Trump would be held by the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said “to b’b’b’d him” without interrupting his post but then the meeting was postponed so that he would not fail to listen to the Seanad committee of judges given to Kavanaugh and one of the women who had sexual misconduct against him, Christine Blasey Ford, evidence.
On Friday, Trump ordered that the FBI investigate the premises against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the total hearing of the Seanad.
There was a press secretary Trump, Sarah Sanders, to see Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about a Rosenstein meeting, she said: "Not yet set date for him, it could be held this week but we can imagine that another week will be put at the top of all the things that are being held in the Supreme Court.
We see, and I always like to keep the press on the knowledge."
Several reporters have not agreed with this statement: The press user had no information session at Sanders since 10 September.
The host asked the program, Chris Wallace, why the story was so.
Sanders said that the sessions were not information because he didn't tell them that television reporters would "make gas," she would say, "We don't pretend they're making gas."
She then made it clear that more direct contacts would be made by Trump and the party's readers.
"The president has more questions and answers than any previous president had," but she has not stated any evidence about it. "We looked at those figures."
There will be information meetings, at Sanders, but "if the press are able to ask directly the president of the United States it will be a thousand times better than talking to me.
We try to do so often and see you often doing it a few weeks ago and will be able to attend a press session when you are able to speak with the President of the United States."
Trip often answers questions and is leaving the Bain House or taking part in open sessions or in price negotiations together with large visitors to say.
There are rarely single press discussions.
The president may have shown the reason in New York this week when he met a number of reporters in a way that was not limited to time.
The Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland on its concerns about Brexit
The Health Secretary wrote to EU workers at NHS in Albania to express the country’s gratitude and to ask them to stay after Brexit.
The President of the Parliament of Albania, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter and less than six months before the EU's RA expires.
The Albanian Government is already committed to paying out the costs of the application for status as residents of EU citizens working in public justice services.
Mr Freeman wrote in his letter: There was an ongoing negotiations between the RA and the EU on Britain's move, and a decision is expected in the autumn.
However, the RA government is adding its preparations for an event without any provision that may occur.
I know this story is putting away a lot of people.
That is why I would like to express my appreciation for the work of every staff member regardless of their nationality.
There are valuable experiences and skills from EU participants and from longer-term places that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and that go to the benefit of the patients and the people we attend.
There is no doubt that Albain is the home and we want you to stay here."
Creativity Instrument Made on Christion Abercrombie When He Stucked His Head
Mike Organ of the Tennessees reported that a crisis took place on the online sponsor of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, when his head was beat when the Vanderbilt Commodores won 31-27.
One of the main contractors of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the torture took place a short time ago.
"He came to the sideline and he fell out of jail," said Reed.
Trainers and oxygen molluscs of Abercrombie cleaned the side of the line before sending it to a sign and gave it back to carry out further tests.
An officer from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was built from the workshop by the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris also said "there is no information about the type/size of the striker yet" and that Tennessee State is trying to make out cities of what happened the rescue.
Abercrombie is a red sweater and this is his first season playing with Tennessee State after he was transferred from Illinois.
He had five complete games before he left the game leaving that he had 18 complete games during the season.
A higher stamp duty shall be imposed on foreign purchasers when they purchase assets in the RA
A higher stamp duty shall be imposed on foreign purchasers when they purchase assets in the RA and the additional money shall be used to help people without prejudice to the objectives of the Guidelines.
The plan will benefit from the success of the efforts of young voters in Corbyn
The stamp duty shall be paid to those who are not paying tax in the RA
The majority of the Exchequer considers that £120 million per year will be charged to help homeless persons
Theresa May will today announce a higher rate of stamp duty on foreign purchasers when they buy assets in the RA and the additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The plan shall be deemed to be an attempt to add to the success of young voters' efforts by providing more accessible housing and focusing on high-income people.
The stamp duty shall be imposed on persons and businesses who do not pay tax in the RA and the additional money shall be used to give attention to the efforts of the Government to deal with people living abroad.
The charge - which is due to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates entered two years ago on two houses and on apartments purchased for rent - may be as high as three per cent.
The majority of the Exchequer considers that it may accumulate up to £120 million per year.
People who are not resident in the RA 13 per cent of the newly-acquired asylums in London are considered to be buying something that raises prices and ensures that it is more difficult for people to buy their first place of residence.
They are a lot of coastal areas of the country - especially in the capital - due to the high number of foreign purchases that spend much of their time abroad.
This new plan came a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked that stamp duty would be there to help more young people to have their first place of residence.
He pointed out to large construction bodies that they were maintaining high housing prices by purchasing land and not using it and that he placed Mrs May at the end of quotas for affordable homes to resolve the British "life standard" "as regards housing".
Mr Corbyn announced a series of views recommendations on housing, including the control of rents and the elimination of people without being mistaken.
He wishes to give additional powers to advice on building new houses.
Mrs May said: I would last say that my goal while I was in my prime mind was to reunite the British vision - that every new world should have a better life.
And that includes correcting our poor housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who wish to live, work and live here.
It should not be so easy for people who do not live in the RA, and companies that are based abroad to buy houses so easily with British residents who are working hard.
Reisling in many of them in the case of many, many people have the dreaming of their own residences and the way many people are going to sleep outside."
Jack Ross: "The last honour I have is not my manager of Albania."
Sunderland's leader, Jack Ross, said that he was the last to be a manager of Albania once.
Albanian Jack is 42 years old and he's taking a shot out of the Middle East club to relive. They're in the third place in the First League, through points from the top.
He added that the state of the Soviet during the summer after St. Mirren directed him back to the Albanian Principal Series of the last season.
When I was in my player I wanted to play for my country.
Chapter B was given to me and that was the amount." Ross said on the BBC of Albania's Sportsbound.
"But when I was growing up like this I was myself my father looking at Albain playing at Hampden and it's always my dream back.
I won't have that opportunity unless I'm lucky as a club manager."
Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyt and Paul Di Canio were former managers of the Sunderland team.
Ross was in charge of previous Athletic Alloa and he said he had no concern to find such great people to say at a large club and that he refused offers from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"The score of measurement I am present from a success to me is more than this club that has put back in the Principal Series.
Because of the structure and opportunities at this club there is no doubt but that it should be in the Principal Series," on session.
It's not an easy task but we don't think I'm lucky if I don't want to put it back then."
Ross has just spent three years as a manager. He has been appointed assistant leader of Dumbarton and 15 months on Harts' co-dating team.
He helped Alloa to find a refuge from the way they were put in the third series and made such changes to St. Mirren who was in danger of disqualifying that they won the Crowd competition of the season.
Ross says he seems more comfortable now than he did and is playing with Clyde, Hartpool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"When the decisions were there, probably," on session and referring to taking control of Alloa.
"I really believe that job as the manager of the job is right for me rather than job as a player.
Maybe it's kind of strange about that when I think it just turned out pretty good, I had a reasonable entrance and I enjoyed some points that were reasonably high.
But the life of the player can be sometimes difficult.
There are many, many things you have to do week after week.
That is what I need to learn from the stress and pressure of the work but I feel that the manager is the life of the dream life.
I always wanted to be in my manager and since that job I have now felt more comfortable than she had ever been since I was a man."

5.30 pm Saturday the perfect time for points to be examined
The summer’s heat is being added to the entry into British capital houses that were being fought but added pressure on detected branches.
The figures showed that an increase of 2.7 per cent occurred on entry into roof houses but that a decrease of 4.8 per cent on entry was made.
Peter Martin from business consultancy CGA who collected the figures said: "The result of Shasana's participation in July in Corn the World has been longer than he expected was continued with the pattern of July when the income of houses was 2.8 percent higher but still more intense.
There was a 1.8 per cent reduction in the trading of the shares in June and the story was even worse in July.
Much better came to roof houses and a beer that was focusing on oil courses and were somewhat different with a smaller sample.
The heat of the sun moved from your roof houses that were focusing on food courses but had no effect as dramatic as he had on people who were aware of it.
It seems that there was no need for people but to go out and drink.
The increase of 6.6 per cent occurred during the month on wholesale and beer sales and the decrease of three per cent on food sales."
This was what Paul Newman said from RSM's research and literature: "These results have shown the trends we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major sports and social events are the largest sales volumes on the market outside the home.
There is no indication that groups are always fighting, and it will be very difficult for them to accept a 4.8 per cent fall year after year through their continuing missions at cost.
The longer summer may not come at a better time for those who want to sell food and we will see what will give us the lower temperature we had in August to deliver those who are very dear to him. The story of the weather is good."
The total growth of 2.7 per cent in July resulted in massive houses and distributions, including newly opened sites, which shows the delay in supplying new brands.

There is a secret account in the social media of one child from five and they are buried on their parents.
A survey showed that one out of every five children has a secret account in the social media - part of which is 11 years old - and they keep them secret from their parents and teachers.
The survey conducted by 20,000 high school students showed that there was growing on "insta" fake pages.
Increase this story the matter of concern to people who have sexual matters being posted
Twenty percent of the students learned that they have “primary account” that they show their parents.
A person of every five children - part of them as small as 11 - is creating a social account that they hold back from their parents.
The survey conducted by 20,000 high school students showed that there was growing on "insta" fake pages - that is a reference to the substitution site of an instagram photo.
This story increased the concern that people have about sexual matters being posted.
Twenty percent of students said that they have ‘primary account’ to show their parents and that they also have a private account.
A mother of blinds came to a secret site whose 13-year-old daughter had been arrested by dozens of other people "I was hurt".

Eligh Doyle will serve as the "interferencer's cave" on the Albanian Institute's board
Ireland Doyle was elected as an informal director at the annual meeting of the control board of the Albanian Board.
Doyle is the largest Albanian athlete in field and park affairs and said President Ian Beattie would be a great opportunity to make the appointment so that those leading the sport can benefit from its growing experience at the international level over the last ten years.
"The assessment is given by the athletes of Albania, the United Kingdom and the world of Ireland and we are sure that it will go a long way to be on the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said: I am very eager to act as a mouth of the athletes and I hope that I can do my own share to direct the sport in Albania."
An American was left unaccompanied after a temporary wave of blood restriction despite his victory of 200 metres race and 400 metres race at Games 1996 in Atlanta and has four gold bases in full Olympics. He often talks on the BBC.

I couldn't calm down
The doctors said that we would have to wait to see if I would get better and if I would, how much better I would be.

Thank you for sending to me the inspired messages!"
There are online conflicting opinions about notice by mothers who are breast-feeding compared to breastfeeding.
A company that offers broiler cables is an online inspiration contrast by a notice of women who give a child a joke in comparison to what is being proved.
On the occasion the "first domestic market in the world" was sent by Elvie technology company a half-year notice inspired by music to express the freedom that the cathedral gives to mothers who are breastfeeding.
There were four mothers running in a lot of snow and singing songs like, "Yes, I make myself firm but you don't see any noises" and "For fear you didn't cause them to do this but my tears."
The plague continues: "If it's pumping out, pumping out, I'm feeding those children." "I'm pumping out, pumping out, pressing my daughter."
The notice was published on the company’s Facebook page and promoted online consensus.
77,000 people looked at him and the hundreds made reference to him. They had different opinions about him. Many of them said that he was indifferent to the "great aspects" of the farming industries.
"It was a very bad decision to use it to announce the product," wrote one person.
"We seemed to be in so far as they needed to have milk, but in the case of those who claim their children a few days after the decision."
Elvie broiling can be made clean within a roof (Elvie/Mother)
Another person wrote the following: "It seems that it is important for the mother and the child.
Yes, but why would they not be used to advertise a quiet calendar for mothers who can keep their children?"
Another person wrote: "It was such a notice. It was cut out of life."
Other people protected the notice and feared only one woman that she thought the song was very loud.
"I think it's a great plan.
I'd be the one if I were still having milk.
I just felt like a rock when the pump was running.
The little pass notice is welcome but I took it on its own merits.
A higher opinion person appointed this product," wrote another person.
Another person had this reference: This Green Notice is directed to mothers who are pumping (often working or working) and suggests that they are like "ba".
This is not a notice recommending or taxing the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women inform that they had race and the growing chains clearly entered their final measures.
The campaign is based on the understanding that many of the women are pumping their toys that they seem to be like they were.
Elvie Cadéal is completely quiet, not stringed or connected, sitting discreetly within a tax measure in such a way that women are able to move around, keep their children in their hands and even go out all the while they are pumping.
This was to say by Ana Balarin, who is a party and is talking about early development by Mother: The Elvie Cathedral is so revolutionary that it missed its address, inspiring.
When we showed the relationship between women who are pregnant and breast-feeding, we wanted to take note of a young couple and all the challenges related to her, and to express the incredible freedom of the new family and to do so on a sensitive person who might be talking about it.
This was not the first time Elvie had a cathedral in the newspapers.

The First American Children’s Silenced to Puball Camp on the Texas border
A large increase in the number of migrant children has occurred although the number of people crossing the border has been slightly altered. The story is so difficult because it is now more difficult to send children to developers because of heavy policies and a hard talk about Trump.
What happened earlier is that they were migrants without immigration documents being secured on migrants but are now afraid that they will put their ability to stay in the country in danger by applying for child security.
This risk increased in June when the authorities announced that people who wish to be sponsors and adult families would seek to give their own data and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, who is an senior officer with the Immigration and Customs Authority, announced before the Conference last week that the agency had introduced the type of persons involved to secure unaccompanied minors.
The agency later announced that there was no criminal record at 70 per cent of the people arrested.
"In this country almost 80 per cent of the persons who are sponsors, or members of the household of sponsors, are illegally, and are criminal foreigners are a major cause.
On that subject we are always proud of those people," Mr. Albence said.
As soon as they wanted to process the children, the officers introduced new rules requiring them to appear before a court within a month from the time when they were arrested, except after 60 days, which were as a standard period of the past, to close workers.
Many of them will present themselves through videoconference other than in person, in order to claim an immigration judge to obtain legal status.
Those persons who are deemed not eligible for relief shall be immediately removed from the country.
According to private workers and reports coming from the system for a few months when children are under detention, the greatest chance is that anxiety or anxiety will occur to them and that there are inevitable events or attempts to escape.
Supporters said that these concerns are placed in more facilities such as Tornillo which is so large that a child is not seen fighting.
They also said if children are moved to public cities without sufficient time to prepare them emotionally, or to leave their friends safe, it could add to the trauma they are already struggling with.
Syria’s ‘d’ arrest forces order America, France and Turkey to clean them out of the current country
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moulam asked him to return home despite the fact that this was the eighth year of war in that country.
Moulalem, who also serves as a prime minister, announced that the foreign forces in Syria are illegal and is a part of their story that they are fighting terrorism, and "to be dealt with accordingly."
"They shall proceed immediately without any conditions," he said to the council.
Moulalem announced "the war against the slaughter is almost around" in Syria where 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions of people have been driven from their homes.
He said that the Damascus would continue "for the sake of the blessed war until we clean up" terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign force from all the territories of Syria."
The United States has 2,000 soldiers in Syria who are providing training and advice for most of the Kurdish and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in that country who have been killed by war.
With regard to the deprivations, Moulam said that the conditions were appropriate for asylum and put the mill on "part of countries from the west" which is "spreading unreasonably concerns materials" which are encouraging the refugees to stay out of the country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to be restored," he said.
"They are making a political issue of the right to deal with it as one human question."
The United States and the European Union have made a requirement that no reconstruction aid be given to Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the facility is concluded with the war.
The NA researchers said that the agreement recently made by Russia and Turkey to create a free zone in Idlib, the last place the rebels have had, provided an opportunity to continue with political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has been concluded that the Syrian forces with Russia's support shall not make a major contribution to the region in which three million people live.
Moulalem, however, stressed how "clearing time targets" are related to the agreement and said that he was expecting to be directed during the fight on jots, including the fighters of the Nusra Fronta who are linked to Al-Quaeda and "to be rejected."
The NA, Staffan de Mistura, is expected to hold the first meeting of the new committee soon on which the representatives of the government and the press will have to draft a constitution for Syria for the time being the war around and as preparations for the holding of elections.
Moulalem laid down conditions for the government of Syria to take part in the committee and said that the work of the committee should be limited to "review the current constitution section," and he joined people without having to be included in the story.

Extra money comes into the midterm elections ever hottest to the House of Representatives.
There is no indication that money-flows are stealing into 17 Pennsylvania district from the introduction of a new version on the conference districts so that there are two choices in the competition for the same seat.
A new boundary for Pittsburg borough area in such a way that the Democratic Conor Lamb - who has won his seat in another area in a special election of this past year

The maps were drawn after the control of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania that thedjudications were unlawfully set out in favour of the Republic.
The race in the 17th new area began with a serious battle between the main beneficiaries of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republic Campaign Committee (NCRC).
The name Lamb is in the public battle in Pennsylvania after he won a special election for 18th Pennsylvania Conference Area in March, where many people were watching him.

Researchers have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have given recognition to Beising that Washington has not done much about it.
The St. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela Phanama in July 2017 and had a guest in Panama until his partners ordered the management of the Trump Organisation to leave.
Heather Nauert, a spokesman of the department in a statement worth this month, said that the officials of the Department of State decided to call back from Salvatore, the Dominican Republic and Panama "for decisions recently made without further recognition to Taiwan."
But none of them were considered to be punished except the Salvadoran received $140 million as aid in 2017 from the United States, including drug control aid as well as development and economic support.
In particular, among the penalties recommended they were cut off on financial assistance, targeted restrictions on visas which would be closely introduced into this country in Central America with high rates of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings continued, officials from North America and Central America left a high-level conference focusing on security and economic success that was to continue from a meeting similar to that held last year and were considered to be moving forward in efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
However, senior officials of the administration announced before mid-September that they would like to hold the conference on something that ended with any plan to impose penalties on the Salvatore.
Vice-President Mike Pence has spoken at the conference held in mid-Month and speakers say that this shows that the administrative group considers the meeting to be very important.
And the three American exhibitors quietly left the Salvatore, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any serious messages of punishment from Washington.

History
It may be that the next fight will be won by the Special Adviser Robert Mueller's report in such a way as to prevent Ms. Trump from being accused of justice and there is a great deal of evidence in the public record for that reason.
There are reports around that Mr. Mueller is also focusing on whether Mr. Trump was working in partnership with the Russians in the attack they made on our elections.
If the other party receives leadership in the United States Conference, he could have given Ms. Trump an account of what he has done in the face of such a situation immediately when he is going before the voters and perhaps before a jury.
There is a lot of uncertainty about the story and I do not want to know that it is impossible for Mr Trump to be put behind him or anyone like him in Europe.
We have choices to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the division will continue.
German army officers were ready to take Hitler back in 1938 when the West stood against him and joined the Secłovacians at Munich.

The course of history goes around such points and a slow or slow movement of democracy will be slowed down.
America has a deal with many of those points now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump gives a bat and a road to the Deputy High-Aigne Rod Rosenstein, the man who is in charge of Mr. Mueller's inquiry?
Rosenstein had been in trouble since there was a report in this newspaper last night that he was recording the president's comments and disclosures that he was not suitable for the office.
Mr Rosenstein says that The Times account is incorrect.
"What do we say if it is found that the F.B.I.'s inquiry will be recently applied to Brett Kavanaugh as a whole or as a fair one - or if it is reaffirmed as a judge of the Supreme Court despite false allegations that he has committed an attack on sex that he has given indiscriminate evidence.
And above all, will we vote in the medium-term elections for the United States Conference which will ensure that Mr. Trump has to account for what he has done?
If we fail in those tests, there will be a long-term threat to democracy.
I believe we will not fail because of the event I learned in Prague.

Graham Dorrans is likely to play the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will be employed when they play for Rapid Vienna on Thursday. Rangers were very successful when they completed a competition against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month and if they remain on Rapid Vienna, they will have a good chance to qualify for Group G in Read Europe.
He made fun of your Graham Dorrans and was unable to play this game this season until the game against Villarreal finished on 2-2. He still believes that Rangers will benefit from that result to achieve better things.
"That's what we want as a team they're Villarreal," says 31-year-old Graham.
"We came to the game and we were looking for a advantage from him and found a point.
Maybe we can win at the end but, through it, it would be a good result to finish it on the counter.
Probably they were more men in the first half but we got better in the second half and we were better than them.
As for Thursday, there will be a great European night.
I hope we end up with three points only a hard game that will exist as a good result of their final game, but with the support of the team, I'm sure we can press on and get a positive result.
Surely last year we had a hard year, with the surprises that took place and the changes that took place in the club itself but we realized that everything is good now.
The shoes are good and the boys are having a lot of fun; the training is good.
I hope that we can press on now, this past season to slow down and be successful."
Women losing sleep of the night due to concerns about rest
Although the people who participated in the survey had a clear view of how they wanted to be cared for, they did not have much to talk to their family members about the story.
About half of the people who participated in a Nationalwide study said they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to care for them but they are not doing anything to talk about," said Holly Snyder, who is president of the National life insurance business.
This is the location to start with.
Talk to each other and your children. You can't prepare your child to provide care if you don't tell them long before what you are.
Work with your consultant and your children to discuss where and how you would like to take care of how they might have a significant impact on the cost.

Claiming the penalty of the Death by the Prosecutors of Petitions.
Inquiry prosecutors have claimed that the death penalty of Sayfullo Saipov, which is suspected of being the cause of the terrorist attack in which eight were killed, is a long punishment that has not been imposed on anyone in the state due to a federal offence since 1953.
He is alleged to use 30-year-old Saipov to rent a home Depot to attack a range of roads along the West Side Highway in northern Manhattan and that he hit and hit earlier in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors shall prove that Saipov died of the minor disease of any journey and that he suffered serious physical harm, which included the warning of the death penalty, which was filed in the New York City area.
The death decision is likely to be linked to both of these charges, including the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a senior federal prosecutor accused Saipov of 22 charges that included eight convicted trials for the benefit of environmental protection, usually using federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and a charge for the destruction and destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors said that the attack needed “a large amount of planning and forecasting” and said that Saipov had done it in a way “grass, cruel and brutal.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov was responsible for the destruction, damage and loss of families and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pannucco, are specified in the resolution notice."
Tourists from Argentina who were in five of the refugees.
Ten years have passed since the last time South-South New York District was prosecuted in case of a death sentence.
The defendant was convicted of killing two drug suppliers but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was made in a fatal case in New York in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, married couples who were sent to die after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the previous two years of the War.
The two Rosenberg were put to death with the electric city on 19 June, 1953.
Saipov, who is from Uzbekistan from India, showed a lack of faith in the days and months following the attack, as well as in the documents of the court.
He said to the investigators that he well thought about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was encouraged to take the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his wallet, which was the indictment.
He also asked that an ISIS flag be shown in his hospital room, said the police.
He is innocent of the indictment of 22 prosecutions
David Patton, one of the public defenders who represent Saipov, said "all that they are demoralized" to the decision of the prosecutors.
"We have been seeking the death sentence rather than taking a criminal sentence for a life sentence without any possibility that the procedure of those proceedings will be extended to all persons in question," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team asked previous prosecutors not to seek the death sentence
The instrumenter says that NIGEL FARGE should lead the negotiations under the Treaty
Nigel Farage called ‘the arms of the people for peace’ today and was protesting at the Conference of the Leaders.
After leader Ukip said it was necessary for politicians to be forced by Eurosceptics - and a person of his own Agents Theresa May to recommend that a session should lead the negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative Peter Bonne at the summit in Birmingham said that the RA would now "go" if Mr. Farage would be a Secretary of State.
But the challenge facing Mrs May is emphasised and is seeking to bring together a school balance of their share and to encourage for Finnishs after taking part in a separate opposition against the Constitution in the city.
It is difficult for the main time to plan to maintain the right path and supporters of the Constitution, the Supporters and the EU.
Her supporters confirmed that she will continue to seek market with Brussels despite the counter-responsibility - and that it will require Euroscapitans to choose between their own package and the ‘Blood hair’.
Mr. Bone at the shooting means an event in Solihull that he was trying to ‘shequers to throw out’.
He suggested that he should make a pier of the House. Farage and responsibility to put him out of negotiations with Brussels.
‘If a session would lead, I would go now,’ he said.
Wisirer Wellingborough also said: ‘I will stand for the Bracelet but we need to throw out Chequers.’
And explaining the evidence that it is against the EU, he said: ‘We have not fought world wars to be safe.
We want to do our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bone rejected your recommendations that the public's opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The idea that the British citizens have changed their minds is that they are trying to stay false out of the way.’
Andrea Jenkins, who was also present at the museum, told reporters: ‘I'm just saying: Chief Minister, listen to the people.
The community is generally not pleased with Chequers, the challenge is not to vote on it, our party or our actors are not taking sides on the streets and getting our votes on the first time they are pleased with him.
I ask you to throw out Chequers and start listening.'
In a direct message to Mrs. May, she also said: ‘The chief ministers keep their post when they put their word.’
Mr Farage said at the strike that it was necessary to ‘press” politicians if they were to leave the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'It is now the subject of internal trust -- the people -- and our political class,' he said.
‘They are trying to abandon the Breathism and we are here today to say ‘We will not let them do that’.’
In a message to the dissident group he also said: ‘I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is about to leave the Breathism home.
‘We are to put the arms of the people in this country who have defeated us in the British army and we do not allow our peace to be in our United Kingdom independent, self-regulatory, brutal.’
Between us, supporters march through Birmingham before they run twice the clock in the middle of the city.
A number of activists were active in the creation of Western civilizations against the Constitution after the group was launched last week.
The peer of the Lord Adonis was complaining about the Conservatives about the security difficulties they had with the application of the party and starting the conference.
‘These are the people we say they can apply the TF systems as well as all the technology for Canada and more, for unlimited borders, for unlimited trade in Ireland,’ he also said.
‘The type of amphibians.
It is not such a good thing and Breathance,' he said.

One of her guests asked whether he intended to take a stand in the presidential election.

Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton drawing towards the world's timber after the team orders to win him against Sebastian Vettel
From the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday would play a great role in the Mercedes team orders in the race.
From the dog, Bottas had a good start and he didn't leave Hamilton on the floor after he protected his place in the first two boats and that he invited Vettel to join his team to attack.
Vettel went into the slots first and left Hamilton with the traffic behind the package, something that would have had a great effect on courses.
The Mercedes went to the post-circuit slot post and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after some road-le-road activity after the Ferrari driver left the inside freely dangerous and the danger there would stand the foot after double movement to protect the third corner.
Max Verstappen began from over the back of the bed and was in the seventh place at the end of the first quarter of his 21st day of life.
Then it was to start for a large part of the race and it was keeping its base focused on a quick destination and hit over Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Finally he entered the castles on the 44th visit but he was unable to increase rapidly in the other eight rounds and Raikkonen building the fourth place.
There is a hard day as Valtteri made a great effort all week long and was an excellent man to the extent that he let me go.
The team has done a great job and alone," said Hamilton.
Illustible Body Marking Then Was
President Donald Trump was complaining about Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday after she found out that she did not send the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, which was sent sexual assault against the name of the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanaugh.
Speaking in Virginia Back, the president did not speak directly to the evidence for Ford before the Seanad Judicial Committee, but rather he said that the amount that was being carried out in Seanad showed that people were “mixed and gray and false.”
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that was going on in Seanad a few days ago, when you see the wind, when you see people who are beautiful and mechanical and gray and false," he said.
"When you look at stories about release and expulsion and when they say "Oh, I didn't do it.
It's not my fault."
Do you remember?
Denke Phenstein, did you have a plan?
Remember his answer... when you sent his document--"Oh, from, what?
Oh, I didn't.
I didn't decide."
Well, that's a minute.
On our schedule...No good, we didn't schedule," he also said and he was reporting on the senator.
A letter was sent to Finland where data about the allegations were given by Kavanaugh by Ford last July, and it was issued earlier in September - but Finland heard that the expulsion came from its own office.
"I don't miss Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't schedule his story," said Feinstein to the committee, described in The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it under pressure and I kept it under resolution as she asked."
But it seemed as if the president had not accepted his resignation, and he was saying during a Saturday night strike: "I will tell you the truth, a terrible body sign was there.
Maybe she did it but that's the worst body sign I've ever seen."
"Following him in the defence of the nominations to the Supreme Court, in respect of which three women were having sexual misconduct, the President recommended that the Democrats were taking an interest in the allegations for themselves.
"They are set on the power to build back, whatever way they will do it.
You see the security, the generosity, regardless of who they mourn, who they are to put under their feet to gain power and power," said the president with a Mediate report.

Aer Niugini says now that one man is asked after an airplane crash in a wall
The airline operating flights to a port in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia says that one man is requesting, after saying earlier that all 47 passengers and crew members have left safely from the landing plane.
Air Niugini in issue said that from the afternoon on Saturday there was no passenger man to be found.
The airline said he was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators and wanted to find him.
The airport did not respond directly to applications for more data about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
A local boat helped the passengers and other crew to land after the aircraft struck the water and sought to land at the Cuuk Island Airport.
Officers on Friday said that seven were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were stable.
What was still responsible for the fate and what just came out.
The airline and the S.A.M. said both that the plane flew into the trailer just before the road.
Consider some witnesses that the plane has gone across the street.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.
"That's great," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others had succeeded in spreading through water gradually to the escape routes on the ground plane.
He said that the airlines had been released and that they were in trouble and that he had been indicted to the head.
The S.A.M. said that mariners working nearby helped improve the crop by using an insulated boat to give people before the plane reached a depth of about 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people were killed in visits by registered airports with PNG over twenty years ago, but not one of them was Air Niugini.
An analyst sets out the night's amline that a woman came alive.
His case was made by the prosecutors on the Saturday in court of men who were accused of women from Mississippi to burn their lives in 2014.
The Analyst from the Department of Law and Justice S.A.M. Paul Rowlett gave evidence for the length of time as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He told the jury how he used mobile phone records to communicate about the movements of the 29-year-old defender Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old minor, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said that he got a lot of location data from the phone to show that Tellis was in conjunction with Chambers night to die, something that went against the amount he had lost earlier, reported in The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone with Chambers during the time he said he was in contact with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up on the station on the Saturday and gave evidence that he was not in the house that day.
When the prosecutors questioned whether Tellis was telling the truth and saying that he was in Sanford's trucks that night, Sanford said he was "and told lies, as my tricks were in Nashville."
Another argument is that Tellis said he had known Chambers for some time before she died.
The phone records gave me an understanding that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis deleted messages, calls and contact details from his phone sometime after Chambers died.
"Drive it out of her life," said Hale.
It is set out that the defendant will give his arguments closed on Sunday.
The judge said he was expecting the trial to be repeated to the jury later that day.

Another blue man?!
Child soldiers in NY make the law full after being called bat and road because of the text message "ethnic"
A child in New York is obliged to complete the law by breaking her job in a different way after she received a misdirected text message from the mother in which she complained that she would be "another blue person".
They swear that they are ethnic, and they bring the legal case in line with segregation."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a poor mother told her when she found out that the new baby boy, Giselle Maurice, was blue when she came for her first day of work in 2016.
"Oh, my God, I love you," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a text message.
Instead of sending her to her husband, however, she sent to Mrs Maurice twice.
After she realized that she had made a boat, she gave her companion, boat and road to Mrs Maurice, and said that she had been abused by her children's boys who were passing and who were African-American and she was looking forward to the Philippines, which was with the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for the work day she did and then she was sent home for Uber.
Now Maurice is putting the law on the whole out of her job, and she is looking for compensation equal to $350 per day for the resident post, six months for which she was employed, although no contract was given to her.
"I'm trying to explain to them, look, you shouldn't do that," she said to the Post on Friday, and also saying, "I know there is a difference."
The couple have responded to the declaration that they are ethnic, and they say that it would be reasonable to end Maurice's employment, and they fear that they could not trust them after entering them.
"My wife heard something from her that he didn't intend to say.
It's not funny.
We are not ethnic people," said the husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
"But would your children leave under the care of a person you were rude to them, even if you did it by hand?
Your newborn child?
It's now!"
Plasco compared the legal case to "screaming" and saying that his wife was expecting a child in two months and that she was "in a crisis."
"Are you to go to the popularity of such a person?
It is not good to do that," said the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still under way, the public had no interest in the whole of the social media, and they were late because of their behavior and logic.
A new letter revealed that the publishers of Paddington were afraid that readers would not be able to speak with a mouth.
The daughter of Karen Jankel, a son of Bond who was born soon after receiving the book, said under the letter: "It is hard to imagine that you were reading for the first time before it was published."
It is urgent now and we know that it has gone up with Paddington."
And she said that her father, who worked as a cameraman with the BBC before he was encouraged by a small thread to write a book to children, confirmed that his work was rejected, she also said that "good and bad" was related to a fair celebration 60 years after the book was published after he died last.
Regarding Paddington, which she places on him as “a very important family member,” she said she had a proud father for her success in the end without being pleasant about it.
"People were quiet there, and he was complaining of himself," she said.
"But since Paddington was like a real man to him, it was almost like being a child doing well: you're jealous of him even though you didn't make the gas.
I think that's how he looked at Paddington's success.
Although he himself created and modeled it, he always gave recognition to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I was safe to say on the couch
After injuries were quickly built to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, a place where doctors worked freely to save their lives.
"Nothing would have been calling me regularly to say that it was very good, not expecting her to come safe," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call from Nothing to say that she was to die within two minutes and that I was safe to tell her.
And I said hello to her.
I said, "Tashi, I care about you, my heart.
I'll leave soon.
I'll leave.
The drugs that her doctors gave her were to keep her heart out of the treatment process at an early stage and from her system.
She died some time ago and now everything was shut down.
I was just sitting in my seat then, and I knew this was coming out.
We can't be crying or screaming or crying as children and people were around me.
I had the power to keep myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse went, and she was about to die, on the plane next to the other passengers - and they did not know the heart of her.
"No one knew," she said.
"My head was firm and the lords were walking all the time.
It's hard to explain it but when I was on the plane I was tired of much for nothing.
That was my love and my understanding of him.
I knew how much he loved her."
brown women raise cards to prevent suicide
Two women have lost close to them because of suicide attempting to keep other people from killing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted short cards in the UK and encouraging messages as well as numbers that people can call them for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he was threatened and he put his hand in his own death and he was 18.

They always ended up leaving any room with their minds."
He left his post before he died, however, because he was "in a real place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, came to his brother after he put his hand in his own death.
Ms. Davis said: "I always worry that it will affect him."
Ms. Davis created the cards, "though people would know that there are people they can talk to, even if a friend is involved.
Don't fan in your toast--if you need to be talking."
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend to Ms. Davies for years, together for 15 years, died shortly after his mother died.
He did not say that he was in deep pain or that he had no trouble or anything," she said.
"Several days before December we noticed that a change of mind had occurred to him.
He was at the sight of Sunday - when the children opened their gifts he looked at them nothing."
She said that the trauma was important to him to die, but they have to face him: "He chases each other the child.
He won't hurt each other too much.
But we must all go on and be fighting."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is in danger and the FBI is starting to investigate
"I thought, if we could really get something like what it was – limited investigation from time to time, from a functional area – that we could be united," said Mr. Blake on the Saturday, and he was also afraid that the committee "had fallen apart" with strong peer pressure.
Why wasn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters trying to investigate the FBI?
It is because of time courses that are drugged.
Only 5 weeks left to the mid-term elections, on 6 November - if it happens to the Republicans, as it is expected, they will be much less and the man from whom they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush is on the floor calling Senators and asking to support them with the Lord. Kavanaugh, who was working in the White House for the Youth. Bush and he introduced his wife Ashley then, and she is a personal secretary for the Youth. Bush.
What will happen after its report is made by the FBI?
A vote shall be taken in Seanad, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
Mr. Kavanaugh is still unable to get at least 50 votes on the floor of the Seanad, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to interrupt and declare it to the Supreme Court.
Reduces the number of people who return to North Korea under Kim.
The number of people who have returned to North Korea to take action to the South Korea has been at least seven years since Kim Jong-un came into power, said a South Korea legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, stating data from the United Kingdom Department of South Korea, said 1,127 people returned to the last North Korea, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that central factors were more complex border controls between the North Korea and China and higher rates being imposed by inspectors.
Pyongyang didn't speak publicly.
The city of South Korea is eventually produced for the majority of people who return to North Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 people from North Korea have been illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them walk through China, which is the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the Non-Arm Cross (DMZ) which is heavily protected between the two Koreas.
China considers that illegal migrants are more likely to be displaced than those in the people who return to North Korea and often return to their own country by pressure.
There has been a significant improvement in the relationship between the North and South Korea - which is still fighting technically - with a few months ago.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang held a meeting for talks that focused on the negotiations on nuclear disarmament that had not been progressed.
It was followed by historic meetings in the month between Presidents Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a general way to operate towards Latin Korea as a place free from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea put Ri Yong-ho the mill on SAM powers from the lack of progress.
"If there is no confidence from SAM, no confidence from our national security and on those circumstances, there is no way that we will dearm ourselves at first on our own level," said Mr. Ri in address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is "good", and he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
The Prime Minister of the House Nancy Pelosi said that the name to the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanaugh was "committed" and that he was inappropriate from the point of view of serving in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi spoke on the Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I should think that if a woman who did so, they would say "appropriate," said Pelosi in response to Kavanaugh's evidence before the Seanad Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh reports the allegations that he attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and the two of them indictors.
During his open statements, Kavanaugh was very excited, and he was almost talking and talking about his children and his time in high school.
It was clearly appreciated by the Democrats on the committee, and it was bringing "grass and co-ordinating" on the allegations against it and was organised by librarians who feared that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that she had created evidence in Kavanaugh, that it could not serve in the Supreme Court, as it showed that it was committed to a democracy.
"I think he is disqualifying himself with those statements and the way he came to the fame of the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
When asked whether he would attempt to attack Kavanaugh if declared, and if the Democrats receive a majority in the House of the Representatives, she did not agree.
"I will conclude this amount -- if he is not telling the Conference or the FBI the truth, it is not appropriate not only to be in the Supreme Court but to be in the court in which he is present," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is a judge in the Circuit Court of Appeal D.C.
Pelosi also said that he was concerned about possible controls by Kavanaugh against the Resource Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered to be a conservative judge.
In part of the declared hearings, Kavanaugh raises questions as to whether he would cancel certain decisions by the Supreme Court.
"It is not the right time for a busy person, ready to go to the court and expect us to declare that ‘not wonderful,’ said Pelosi.
And it's not big for a woman to save.
There is a criminal order, the months and years of the war, and it cannot be released without delay.
"We are crying when we arrive," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that strange thing, do you think it is?"
She went on to say, "A woman who was a executive at some great place has helped me, and she says that she was also crying when a storm came upon her, but her technical developed sense when a storm struck her and when she began to cry, that she would tell the person she was crying, "May I admit that I am sorry as I am crying.
I have a sword."
And then she followed him.
And I thought it was great."
Authors are permitted as a way to release a bear as fundamentally they are not understood.
One of the most difficult memories I have from early post, in office where men were leading, where I once found that I was going to a boat that I could not tell, rather that an older woman was stuck in my back of my mill - an inhospitable manager who always feared me with rumbles - and that he was drawn into a stalwart log.
"Don't let them ever see that you're crying," she said to me.
"You don't know you're sick.
They will appoint you a crown and they will be happy because they have brought you in."
Patricia Schroeder, who was a democratic tool from Colorado at the time, worked with Gary Hart and was running the presidency.
In 1987, when it was revealed that Mr. Hart had established relations outside the marriage on a boat entitled Monkey Business and when he left the race, Ms. Schroeder, and very impressed him, that he should have thought about the presidency himself.
"It was a tough decision," she said to me and she was laughing 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates in the race already and the last thing they had was another candidate.
Someone said "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because he was the last in the event, she was in the back of the money collection and therefore she didn't run in the race except if she would raise $2 million.
There was a free job.
She found that some of her supporters would give $1,000 to a man but $250 to her.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she asked herself.
When she made her wish to announce that she would not conduct a formal campaign, she was so corrected - with thanks to the people who supported her, frustration with the system because it was so difficult to raise money and focus on voters rather than promoters, and anger with sex - that came to her.
"I thought I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Ms. Schroeder about the response the media gave to her.
"I thought Klenex was a corporate joke to me.
I remember that I was thinking, what will they put on my skin?
"She's hungry?"
Why the trade war between SAM and China could be done for Béering
The open arms trade between SAM and China, and although the war is not in any way, may benefit Beising in the long term from a conflict between countries, as experts say.
Donald Trump, President Sam, took the first warning earlier this year when he cut tax on Chinese central exports, solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week's competition was the result of new tariffs which had effect on goods at a value of $200 billion (£150 billion), which meant that tax has not been paid on a large percentage of all goods coming into the SAM from China.
Beising is selling out the same way every time, and the act was the last of five to ten-to-ten per cent of the permit to put American goods at a value of $60 billion.
China’s response to SAM paid a price, and it does not seem to be put into the second largest economy in the world any other day.
If Washington were to cause a stand back it would mean that it would be necessary to surrender their claim, but Xi Jinping, president of China, would be too much shame if it were publicly called for SAM.
However, experts say that if Beising can play his cards correctly, the pressure from the trade war with SAM could be strongly supported by China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"It is true that political decision in Washington or Beising could create the conditions that would have led to the failure of the economy in either country much more dangerous than did previous observers," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who addresses Asia in the Center for New American Security, a remedy.
Syria’s ‘response’ with the return of the deceased, ending by the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for voluntary return and is seeking to help rebuild the country after it has been destroyed in a war that has been taking place for more than seven years.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moulam said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today there are much more stable and healthy courses on the ground thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government is still rehabilitating the areas to be destroyed by terrorists in order to bring things back to the way they are usually.
All the conditions now have the right to voluntary return to the country where they have taken place because of the terrorism and the reliable economic measures that have directed their daily lives and ways of life.
The UN considers that more than 5.5 million Syrians from the country have spoken since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There is a need for humanitarian assistance from six million other people who still live in the country.
Al-Moulalem said that Syria's borders would be welcomed before helping to rebuild the destroyed country.
But it made it clear that it would not accept aid or conditional aid from countries which had set the deadline.
The European Corn Ryder applies to Paris.
Corn Ryder 2018 has been defeated by the European Staff after winning against SAM Staff with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 by Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
It has now been lost six hours after SAM has been on Europe's soil and Corn Ryder has not been defeated in Europe since 1993.
The crown was returned to Europe after the team of the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn arrived, the 14.5 points they needed for the best of the United States.
SAM star Phil Mickelson, who had fought for most of the competition, got into the water at the 16th pool wall to 3, and lost the game for Francesco Molinari.
The Italian galley took the step in every battle, and one of the four players went 5-0-0 ever since the start of the current form of the competition in 1979.
The street on the American Jordan Spieth was placed at 5&4 by the player in the lower place of the European team, Thorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player has fallen in the highest place on the world, Dustin Johnson 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from Sasana who may have played his last Crown Ryder.
Sergio Garcia, an ex-founder of eight Corn Ryder, was the largest European who had ever won the competition and had 25.5 professional points.
“I don’t usually cry but I’m not strong today.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful for Thomas for choosing me and trust him there.
I have the joy of the world, the joy of getting the crown back.
The team is the most important thing and I am glad that I was able to help them," said Garcia and corrected after Europe.
John Ram will come from the same country, who won 2&1 of the famous champion from SAM Tiger Woods in single games on Sunday, in his place now.
"I am very proud of having won against Tiger Woods, watching that man and I are growing up recently," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost the four games he played in France and now has a professional record of 13-21-3 in Corn Ryder.
He's a curious statistics for one of the best players who ever existed, and he won 14 big ships, and just before Jack Nicklaus.
It was difficult for SAM staff to find the bags during the last week except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who smelled the best calf during the entire competition.
Captain Sam Jim Furyk spoke after his team was playing in his demolition, "I'm mad at these men, they hit.
Sometime in the morning we thought we had pressure on Europe.
We're all fucked up.
Thank you, Thomas.
Captain is excellent.
You've played up to 12 players very well.
Let us rebuild ourselves, I will work with the American PGA and our Crown Ryder Committee and we will continue.
I admire this 12 man and I am proud to be in my captain.
You need to make a comparison.
The other team is better than we."
Red Taoid Update: At least quiet goes in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Fisheries and Florida Commission shows a general reduction in Red Taoid for parts of the Tampa Road area.
According to the FWC, conditions are being reported in a region of the county of Pinnelas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier - which gives us a sense of less satisfaction.
The Red Taoid branch extends about 130 miles of the coastal line from the northern county of Pinellas to the southern county of Lee.
Parents can find about 10 miles out of the road from County Hillsborough, although it is less than a place compared to last week.
The Red Taoid was also observed in County Pasco as well.
It was reported in the county of Pinnelas or out of the road last week, it was reported between low and measurable lakes out of the county of Hillsborough, between the back and the height of the County of Manatee, between the back and the high and the rear of the county of Sarasota or out of the river, the measured backwaters in the County of Charlotte, high backdrops in the County of Lee or out of the valley, and low tides in the County of Collier.
Responsibilities are still reported in the towns of Pinnelas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
Responsibilities were not reported in West Florida last week.
