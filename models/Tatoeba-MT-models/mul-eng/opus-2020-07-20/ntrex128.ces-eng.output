Members of the Great Assembly are concerned that they will be "like the Mupeti"
Some of the members of the large assembly have proposed that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the large Parliament)
The proposal is therefore intended to amend the name of the Assembly to the Grand Parliament.
Members' meetings are concerned about the political spectrum, so that the name could be used as a joke.
One member of the Labour Party stated that his group is afraid that "this is happening with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In the majority, twp means pwp and pwp means talk.
A member on the side of Plaid said that the group as a whole "is not happy" and proposed alternatives.
The majority of conservatives indicated that his group had access to a change of name "with an open mind", but noted that MWP was close to Muppet's word.
In this context, the large letter “w” is similarly rendered “u” in Yorkshire English.
The Commission, which is now preparing the legislation for introducing a change in the name, stated: "The final decision on how the members of the large assembly will be called will be of course on the members themselves."
The law of the Great Government of 2017 gave a great assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public advice on proposals where broad support was given to call the Assembly of the Great Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the assembly, the Commission gave priority to the name Welsh Parliament Member, or the WMP, but the MWP option received the largest support in the public debate.
The members' meetings clearly offer alternative options, but the fight to achieve consensus may bring to the attention of President Elin Jones, who has to submit a legislative proposal within a few weeks.
The reform laws will include further changes in the functioning of the assembly, including rules for the disqualification of members and the proposal for a system of committees.
Members' meetings will vote on the question of their title within the framework of the new legislation.
Macedonians are going to vote on the change in the name of the country
On Sunday, they will decide whether their country's name will be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The universal vote should resolve the ten-year dispute with the neighbouring Greece, which has its own province with the name Macedonia.
Athens has long been claiming that the name of the northern neighbour is a lie in the Greek territory and repeatedly protesting against the EU and NATO's request for membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is a sponsor of the plebiscitate on the change in the name, declared that he would not be led by the vote.
The rest of the referendum, including President Zoran Zaeva, also argues that the change of the name is simply a price for entering the EU and NATO.
Saint Martin's calls are silent because the churches in Harlem fight for survival
"The old people I talked to say that he was in every corner of the bar and church before," says Mr. Adams.
"There's no one there today."
The destruction of the bars is understandable.
"People are dealing differently today," she says.
"Bars are no longer living rooms in the fourth place where people walk regularly."
When it comes to churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as their representatives expect, "and sooner or later they will be exactly where they started."
As he adds, churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of people like those who do not help the rest of the saints in the fourth.
"Most people who buy housing in these homes will be white," he says, "and that is why soon the day these churches are completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these homes would become members of the churches."
Both churches built a white congregation even before Harlem became a black metropolis – the metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin, ten years later.
The original white methodical congregation was established in the 30th century.
The building took place in the Black Congregation, where the worship of Jehovah was soon to be practiced.
St. Martin took over the Montenegrin Congregation under the direction of the Reverendo John Howard Johnson, who was standing in front of the retail shop on 125th Street, the main shopping center in Harlem, who refused to hire or raise the blacks.
The fire was badly damaged in 1939, but when Johnson's parents planned his reconstruction, they ordered out loud.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Johnson's father and his successor to St. Martin, called the bells of the poor.
The team, which played on the radio in July, called it a "cultural treasure" and a "non-repetitious historical tool".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that it was the first radio show in the world to be played by the Montenegrin singer Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the largest radio station in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says no one built him in St. Martin.
In the past few months, St. Martin has played a complex story of architects and writers, some of whom have called the laity of the church representatives, others of the Episcopal Diocese.
The Council of Elders - the leading authority of the Farsi, consisting of the medical representatives - sent a letter in July of a diocese expressing concern that dioceses "will try to increase costs" to the council of the older, even though the occupation of architects and writers who sent the diocese has never participated.
Some French people were struggling with insufficient transparency on the part of the diocese.
He was injured in California by a 13-year-old boy who fell for his humour
According to the official report, on Saturday, he attacked and wounded a three-year-old boy who was beaten for his humour on the day of the start of the season.
The attack arrived shortly before 7:00 a.m. near the beach of Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that on Saturday morning he had been down with his friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy calling for help, and then he talked to him with the whole group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel pointed out that he first considered the call to be a joy from the spring, but then “he realized that he cried out, ‘ Kiss me!
Put me down!"
When Hammel got to the boy, he noticed that "he had a wide range of key bones."
“I called for everyone to come out of the water, ‘In the water it is yellow!’ adds Hammel.
The boy was sent to the hospital in a critical state by a nurse at the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego.
It's not known what kind of rabies stand for the attack.
Dr. Larry Giles at the press conference indicated that the grain had been planted in this area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma in the upper part of the body.
The inspection and security authorities closed access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablad after Swami's in Ecinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 types of cereals in this area, but most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the market with cosmetics in Great Britain
Sainsbury's wants to be set up by boots, Superdrug and Debenham's cosmetic streets in the style of a business house, where specializes sellers are available.
In the context of strong market access to cosmetics in Great Britain, which has a value of 2.8 billion free and further growth, while selling fashions and household needs will be tested in 11 markets throughout the country. Then the next year will be extended to other sales.
The investment in cosmetics is linked to the efforts of supermarkets to find benefits for the rules used in the past for television, microwave pipes and household needs.
Sainsbury's states that the double size of cosmetic products up to 3,000 products and first introduces and brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
More space will also be obtained from the L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees branding places like those in stores like Boots.
Supermarket also introduces its makeup-up Boutique, so most of the products will be vegan, which young customers continue to demand.
In addition, in two shops Saintsbury’s will test the concession of retail sales of perfumes Fragrance Shop. The first such trade was opened last week in Croydon, south of London, and the next year will be in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Buying on the Internet and buying on a daily basis a small quantity of food in local shops means that supermarkets need to make more effort to attract people.
Director General Sainsbury's Mike Coupe says sales will continue to look more like business houses, because the supermarket network is trying to better offer services and non-food products to fight discount sales like Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's opened in hundreds sold by Argos and set up a series of Habitats department, which were the grids that bought two years ago. As a result, food sales increased and the aquizies were even more profitable.
The previous attempt to convert the supermarket into a space- and medical class has been unsuccessfully completed.
At the beginning of the millennium, Sainsbury’s joint venture with Boots was tested, but the connection ended after the ruling on the distribution of profits from the sale of medicines in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury sold its 281 doctors for 125 million pounds to Celesio, who owns the network of doctors Lloyds.
Lloyds has a role to play in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury brands to four sales, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Business director Sansbury’s Paul Mills-Hicks says: “We have changed the look and style of the street with cosmetics to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in highly trained colleagues who will be able to deal with customers.
Our brand should satisfy all needs and smooth environments and useful positions mean that we are now presenting a suitable place for the purchase of cosmetics that alter old ways of buying."
Peter Jones was "dissolved" after Holly Willoughby left the contract for 11 million pounds
The stars of the Dragons series Dan Peter Jones are "sustained" after Holly Willoughby's television modator left the contract at $11 million with his lifestyle mark so that she could focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home clothes and belongings Truly.
The surrender of this pair was compared to the meaning of Goop's hero Gwyneth Paltroov.
The seven-year modator of the series announced the departure of the Instagram.
Holly Willoughby invented the stars of the Dragons series Dan Peter Jones by leaving their luxury lifestyle business – to focus on his new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to Jones' information sources, when a television star at a busy afternoon meeting in the middle of his business empire in Marlow in Buckinghamshire, admitted that because of the new contracts – in value up to 1.5 million pounds – it will no longer be able to afford enough time for their domestic clothing and attachment to Truly.
The subcontractor was compared to Goop's hero Gwyneth Paltrovy and could double the wealth of Willoughby's moderators in the estimated 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, a seven-year-old in the Instagram, announced that Truly's badge was missing, Jones was released from Britain to one of his annual seats.
The aforementioned source states: “Truly’s sign was an absolute priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would ensure her for the next few decades.
Her decision to leave all the participants simply shocked.
No one could believe what's going on this afternoon, the landing was so close.
In the centre of Marlow is a full stock of goods ready for sale."
The experts are of the opinion that the departure of the moderators of the series of This Morning, which belongs to the highest British stars, could enable the company to hold millions of companies in view of the competitive investment in the products of the police and the candles after clothing and household clothing and the possible delay in the identification of the mark.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and his wife, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tarry Capov.
Willoughby founded Truly's brand with Tarry Cappov in 2016 and twelve-year-old Jones joined the presidency in March.
Money runs on holiday, and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby has to be a Ambassador of the M&S sign and rewards Anta McPartlina on updating the I'm A Celebrity series on TV.
A source near Jones said last night: “We won’t comment on his business activity. ”
"And then we fell in love"
He scoffed at the criticism he will receive from journalists on the note that some consider as "an inappropriate president" and how he speaks frankly about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
The trumpet answered with its ridiculous "vote" voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He pointed out that after their first Red Meeting in Singapore, Tromp considered it a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea, Kim is interested in the next meeting.
But dealing with the elimination of nuclear weapons was linked to a dead end.
More than three months after the Red Summit in Singapore, a significant North Korean diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN Valéne Assembly on Saturday that North Korea will not see the "responsive response" on its first steps to rearm.
Instead, the United States continues in sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
The trumpet in its appearance has expressed a much more optimistic view.
"We're doing great in North Korea," he said.
"We were on the front of the war with North Korea.
That would be millions of lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
His efforts to improve relations with Kim, according to him, led to positive results – the termination of rocket tests, the release of arms, and the return of the rest of the American soldiers to power.
And he protected his unusual access to information about Kim's relationship.
"It's so easy to act as president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people outside to get into this crazy arena, we'd have about 200 people who would stay right here," Trump said and pointed to the tax before him.
The wave of tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed the islands and killed hundreds of people.
In the post-terranean situation, Lombok, a foreign non-governmental organization, learned that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lomboku's residents were expelled from their homes, there was no national disaster, which is a necessary precedent for speeding up international aid.
"In many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so it is a little convenient," said Mrs. Sumbong.
The Organisation Save the Children has already given a team to travel to Pal, but it is still not clear whether a foreign staff can work here.
Speaking agencies for national disasters Mr. Sutupo said that Indonesian workers evaluate the situation in Paul to see if international organizations would be able to help.
In view of the fact that earthquakes occur very often in Indonesia, the country is still unfortunately not prepared for the anger of Mother Nature.
The Acehu network has been built against tsunamis, but in other parts of the coast, it is not quite common.
He likely contributed to the loss of human life and the apparent lack of sirens warning in Paul’s presence, even though warnings were issued.
In the best time, travel between many islands in Indonesia is also a problem.
And in natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
The hospital ship that sailed to Lombok and helped the earthquake victim is now moving to Paul, but it will last at least three days before the new catacombs arrive.
The improvement of the bad Indonesian infrastructure was the main stage of President Yoko Vidodo's campaign, and the president lost a lot of money on the roads and railways.
The next year, he will again force the election, but his government will suffer in financing.
President Joko also faces pressure from persistent sectoral pressure in Indonesia when members of the Muslim majority accept a more conservative form of faith.
The street fights between Christians and Muslims, with gangs using swords, spears, and other primitive weapons, have already claimed thousands of lives and tens of thousands of people have fled from their homes.
See: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool shot the same branch against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge, on Saturday, in the London Stamford Bridge, was cooked in 89 minutes and saved Liverpool from the explosion with Chelsea in Premier League.
Sturridge got a dog from Herdana Shaqiri about 27 meters ahead of Chelsea's defense when his team lost 1-0.
He turned his sword on his shoulder and shot him into a remote hole.
The plane was flying high and headed to the right corner of the border.
The mouse finally crossed the floating Cape of Arrizabalag and ended up in the network.
"I just tried to get to the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play the most before, so I wanted to get the most time," said Sturridge server LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approach me, so I didn't think too much about it, and I shot at one touch."
Chelsea, in time, led 1-0 after the bell of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
The Blues racer sent the dog back to Matthew Kovacico, then circled around the center of the castle and landed in half of Liverpool.
Kowacic's ball was playing fast.
Then he sent a sword to the beautiful street of Hazard to a rifle.
He ran his weapon and ended up in a remote village near Alison Becker from Liverpool.
In the middle of the 15th hour, Liverpool will run with a local team at the San Paolo Association of Masters at the stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play on Thursday at 15 a.m. in London with Videoton in the European Union UEFA.
The number of Vaccinators in Indonesia grew to 832
As announced by the Indonesian Disaster Authority on Sunday morning, the number of earthquakes and the wave of tsunamis fell to 832.
The 7.5 earthquake hit the floor on Friday, caused waves of up to 6 meters high and forced many people into the coastal buildings, said at a press conference of the language agency Sutopo Purwo Nugro.
The city of Paul, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was visited by a few buildings.
Police arrested a two-year-old suspect from beating a woman.
The woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.

The police officer confirmed that the dead woman lived in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
On Sundays at the scene, friends who think they know the woman to ask where she was found early.
The police reported that they were conducting an investigation and now informing the victims.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mays just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him no one could come to the building or out of it.
When he found out what happened, he wasn't a good word.
The citizens now learned that it would take a few hours before they were able to return home.

Socha Cromwell in Parliament recently became an emergency because of the judge on "recording history"
His departure would be rewarded by the fact that his fanatic Puritan followers in the style of Taliban destroyed a number of English cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Cricka's proposal "a visit" and "an attempt to record history."
President Cromwell of the Society John Goldsmith says: “In the ongoing debate on waste disposal, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell would become one of the goals of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not direct or perform iconoclassism in English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for his predecessor Thomas in the past century."
The physical creation of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the 19th century's view and part of the history of the situation, which many think is still worthy of being praised.
Mr. Goldsmith said to the journalist The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people consider Cromwell, even though today is less than at the end of the 19th century, to the defense of the parliament before external pressure, in his case, of course from the monarchy.
The accuracy of this statement is the subject of unexplained historical debate.
It is true that the conflict in the mid 17th century has created the next development of our people and Cromwell is a well-identifiable institution that represents one side of this transition.
His success in the role of the Lord of Protection also stands for celebration and remembrance."
Killer pig rupture of a Chinese farmer
According to local media information, the market in South-East China has been attacked and killed by a pharmacovigilant.
As he wrote the newspaper South China Morning Post on Sunday, the man in which only the name "Yuan" was introduced was found dead with a blood clot in a blood clot shortly on the market in Liou-pchan-shaj in the province of Kuj-cha.
The driver is preparing to apply the vaccine to pigs on Friday 30 May 2005 in Si-ng in the Chinese province of Čching-chaj.
In the middle of the day, he came with a cousin from the nearby Yun-nan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his brother found him dead and found that the door to the next door was open.
According to him, he had a big vein with blood pressure in his chest.
According to the information, during a forensic investigation, it was confirmed that 250 kilograms of the plant were broken down.
"Brranec had his feet full of blood and broken," quoted the spokesman Guiyang Evening News Brothers, who marks the name "Wu".
The security camera records show how Yuan came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his brother.
The director of the market told agent Evening News that the pig was closed so that no one else could be found when the police gathered evidence at the scene.
The market representatives apparently agree with Yuan's family on the death penalty.
It's a rare thing to see people run away, but it's been a long time ago.
In 2016 the dog attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts and her husband was critical of the morning.
About ten years ago, 300kg of porcupine added a large plant to the tractor and abandoned it to the farmer's wife.
After his pig was eaten by an Orgonian farmer in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said CBC News station that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can work as a “sustainer”.
"They're just playing.
They're scientists... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to pay them enough respect," he said.
The rest of Rosa's hurricane will bring to the South West USA heavy rain
Hurikán Rosa, according to the forecast, is weak and moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
The next day, however, it will bring seawater to northern Mexico and to the south of the United States.
At 5 o'clock in the morning, Rosa reached the wind speed of 137 km/h, which represents the horror of category 1, and was located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
In the middle of the Pacific, there is a speed of low pressure and moves east to the west coast of the USA. As Rosa approaches the island of Baja California in the afternoon, she will have a tropical storm and start to push tropical humidity north to the south-west part of the USA.
In some parts of Mexico Rosa, it will bring up to 250 mm in the afternoon.
Tropical humidity then, with the fast pressure approaching the next day, causes a possible amount of pressure to rise to the south-west of the USA.
The wires 25 to 100 mm are locally responsible for dangerous fires, droughts and possible droughts on the desert.
Strong tropical humidity makes the lines close to 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwestern United States, especially most Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of skirmishes are expected.
In the event of a rapid deterioration of the conditions, due to the different behaviour of the tropical rain forest, it may be possible to cause a wave of floods.
In view of the danger of tropical storms, it would be very unwise to send a spring into the desert.
A strong rain can cause the cannons to become hot rivers, and storms bring local winds and floating rain.
The approaching speed of low pressure will bring strong local barriers to some parts of southern California.
A total of more than 13 mm can be supplied, which could cause less noise of the sutin and closed vehicles.
This will be the first conflict of the rain season in this region.
On Sunday evenings and on Monday mornings, some tropical crossings begin to get closer to Arizona, and on Sunday evenings the rain increases.
On Tuesday, the heavy rain will spread to four corners and will last until midnight.
In October we can expect intense changes in the temperature throughout the United States, because the Arctic will begin to relax, but the tropical sand will still be full of heat.
This sometimes leads to sudden temperature changes on short distances.
A great example of outstanding temperature differences is the middle of the United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City in Missouri and Omahou in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iovë are about 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, he will try again to increase the air temperature.
Most of the land in the middle and in the east of the USA is expected to begin warm summer with temperatures around 27 °C from south-west of the USA.
In New York City it could be 27 °C on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term proposal shows in the first half of October the likelihood of excessive temperatures in the east of the United States.
Bretta Kavanaugh's findings have been followed by over 20 million people
More than 20 million people were watching television channels on six fourth-party appeal to the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Fordó, a woman who accused him of sexual assault, which had reportedly occurred in the 1980s.
In the meantime, political path situations continued and voters interrupted ordinary programmes with reports of a sudden return: the agreement reached by the senator for Arizona Jeff Flake on the fact that the FBI was conducting a single investigation of the charges.
Christine Fordva told the Senate that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had her in high school party and tried to dress her up.
Kavanaugh, in his written statement, said that it was 100% sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the event was followed by more than 20.4 million people running the Nielsen agency.
The company calculated average monitoring at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stations.
The numbers for the other stations that sent comments such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look at the offices.
For comparison, it's a similar number of monkeys who watch football games in play-off or sharing Oskars.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the largest monitoring in all stations when, according to Nielsen's agency, it was followed by 5.69 million fans during the entire day hearing.
The second was ABC station with 3.26 million fans.
Nielsen states that CBS had 3.1 million, 2.14 million NBC, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
He was interested in keeping up after the meeting.
The main stage of the fifth drama was Senator Flake.
Following the announcement by the Office of this peaceful Republican that it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS were arrested on Friday morning, as protestors were shouting at him when he was attempting to proceed to the hearing of the judicial committee.
CNN lived his life as a couple of minutes after he became blind and gave up.
One woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you."
"Do you think the earth is telling the truth?"
He also said: "You have power, while many women are weak."
Flake said his office issued a statement, and even before closing the door, he added that he would say more to the committee.
All cables and television networks were posted alive later when the judicial committee had to vote on the submission of the nomination of Kavanaugh to vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if the prosecution against the candidate was investigated by the FBI for next week, which required a minority of Democrats.
Flakea partially testified to conversations with his friend, democratic senator Chris Cosens.
After talking to Cosen and several other senators, Flake decided.
Flake's voice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have sufficient votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump initiated an investigation by the FBI on charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Mayow accused the critics of being "political" with regard to Brexit.
Ministerial President Theresa Mayov, in his talk for Sunday Times, condemned his plan to leave the European Union, that "politics" about the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa Mayo will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another discussion, which was close to the Prime Minister on the title side, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson opposed her so-called Chequers plan when he said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to choose one another is "not reasonable".
Shooting on Waydea Simse: Police arrested Dyteona Simpson, who is suspected of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in the case of Wayde Simse shooting, 20-year-old LSU player.
The Baton Rouge police department reported that Dyteon Simson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on the basis of a second-level murder charge.
The authorities published videos with the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, and according to the Sims police, he lost his gun at the bridge.
According to the WABF channel that belongs to CBS, the police have made sure they're on the scene and found Simpson's DNA.
Simpson, according to the police after the hearing, admitted he shot Wade.
According to the appellant, the cash was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the Crown Office in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a head and neck injury.
The department is grateful to the police unit for the refugees of the state of Louisiana, the criminal labs of the state police, the Southern University police and the local citizens for assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked local police for "smoothing and violence on justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
Two-foot shooters grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for the LSU,
In the last season, he had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 points for the game.
The basketball coach LSU Will Wade said on Friday morning that Wayde's death was "increased" by the team.
"This is what you're still afraid of," said Wade.
Soupca skin of the populace in Mexico City
The village, which comes from the Popacatepetl fields, invaded the southern quarter of the capital city of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention in Saturday warned Mexico not to come close to the soybean, after the activity of the volcano increased and 183 emissions and floods were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was following a series of burnings and explosions.
On social networks, photos of the main cars covered by the tank have been shown in some fourths of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics reported an increase in the activity of the soybean, which is 72 kilometres (45 miles) south of the main city. The last earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017 and had 7.1 degrees.
Vulcan known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Before the vote on independence, the police had to deal with the Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesting the independence of the police and thousands of people joined in the competition demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence, which was divided into Catalan.
The regular police have blocked a group of masked separatists who have picked up a wolf and a piggy color. These on the streets that are usually flooded with tourists have created a dark cloud of dust.
Later, there was also an explosion of clues that the police had to use their guns to calm down.
Supporting independence groups sang "Don't forget, we won't forgive" faces in the face of the protestors of the Union who called "Let Spain live".
According to local press, fourteen people were injured in protests.
The year after the 1st referendum, which Madrid considers illegal, but the separatist Catalans celebrate it, remains a strong force in the region that continues to grow in independence.
The majority expressed their love for independence, but the participation in the elections was low because the dissidents fought against them.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured after the police tried to stop the vote in the polling stations throughout the region.
Support groups of independence remained on Friday night outside to prevent demonstrations on the support of the national police.
The demonstration went through, but she had to choose another route.
Eightteen-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who joined his wife in a separatist protest, said that he no longer hoped in terms of gaining independence for Catalan.
"We have lived one of the best moments.
My parents were glad they could vote, but now we're in the dark street," he said.
Despite the important fact that the strong victory in the regional elections of London in December has had to fight against the independence of the Italian side to keep things going this year. Many of their most famous leaders have either left themselves to exile or are waiting in court for their participation in the referendum organisation and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Twenty-four-year-old Mount Joan Puig recorded a protest in support of the police on his phone and says that the conflict broke politics on both sides.
"The situation is getting worse," he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Italian leaders who have been waiting for the trial since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that the next year will be running for the European Parliament.
"Candidatur in European elections is the best way to judge the consequences of democratic values and repressions that we are witnesses by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men locked up after the car crash in the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were imprisoned after the car returned home in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 19:30 p.m.
Detective Bob Blemmings said there's been damage to the wall and the home itself.
One minute, maybe someone shot the car out of the kitchen.
Mengo's move gave Livingston victory 1-0 over Rangers
First head of Dolly Mangy for Livingston gave victory
Livingston, who came from a lower division, shocked Rangers and gave Steven Gerard a second piece of 18 games as the manager of the Ibrox club.
Trefa Dolly Mengy showed himself to be decisive when Gary Holt's team got to the Hibernian second place.
Gerard's team is still not in line with the Premiership victory on host grid and the next week will be the first Hearts to lose eight points.
In the meantime, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the European League.
Livingston has expanded a series of non-smokers in the division for six rounds, so the main coach Holt, who shot Kenny Miller last month, hasn't tried the strike yet.
Livingston didn't use a chance against non-visual guests
Holt's team had to take a long time ago because his directness caused Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson won the defense, but before the defense he failed, then Alan Lithgow in the club just quietly passed Craig Halketta's head in front of the bank.
At home, it was enough to watch the Rangers play before them because they knew that guests could handle standard situations.
And so came the key head.
In contrast to Rangers, he was a free dog and Livingston created a shell, Declan Gallagher and Robinson sent Mengo together, which the sword ran and healed in the middle of the county.
In this phase Rangers dominated the holding of the sword, but domestic defense for them was inevitable and the banker Liam Kelly had little work.
The same picture of the game was also in the second time, even when Alfredo Morelos took Kelly into custody.
Scott Pittman stopped the legs of the Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow from another standard Livingston situation.
Livingston continued to fly to the coast, and two penals arrived — after the Halket attack on Glenna Midleton’s rival and the other hand.
"Fenomen" from Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were outstanding and still beyond expectations on their way up.
Their style of games and men haven't changed since they returned to spy, but the great glory is Holt's reward for his coming to the team.
He had so many brains.
Captain Halkett was a huge, well-organized defense, while Menga kept up with Connor Goldson and Joe Worrll for the entire time.
Rangers are not inspired.
They used to be good under Gerard, but these standards are no longer met.
Their concoctions were wired – only one on the home page – and for Rangers it should be a building because they are located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan expected a mixed arrival in Kolín
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met on Saturday (September 29th) for breakfast in Berlin, the sky was blue and all the same smiles.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan in Germany, whose aim is to establish relations between NATO allies.
They did not agree on a number of issues, including human rights, freedom of print and admission of Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Colina, where he opened a huge new museum.
In this town is the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police, for security reasons, prevented 25,000 people from meeting in front of the city, but around there were many supporters who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people — many of them Kurds — were protesting against Erdogan who rejected his policy and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
Opposite protests reflect the controversy of the visitor who some Germans celebrated as a hero and others cursed as an autocrat.
An accident in Deptford: Cyclist died after the strike with the car
He died in London after fighting a car.
The accident occurred about 10:15 at the local time near the Bestwood Street cruiser with the Russian street Evelyn Street in Deptford on the south side of the city.
The driver stopped the car and soon the sanitizer arrived, but the man was dead.
Only a few months after another cycler died about a mile and half of a Saturday tragedy in an accident on Children's Street when the driver took off.
The metropolitan police indicated that the police are now trying to identify and inform him of his presence.
The road is closed, buses are running for repair routes and motorists are recommended to avoid this area.
Long Lartin binding: Six suspects were injured in the non-smokers
According to the prison office, six suspects were injured during interrogations in the male prison.
The rooms broke out in Long Larsin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday about 9:30 a.m., and they still exist.
In order to manage the facilities to which eight prisoners were placed in one class, specialized observers from the “Tornado” team were invited to attend.
Observers suffered mild injury and were treated on site.
The Collegiate Prison Service said: “In order to manage the current incident in Long Larsin prison, the training of prison staff was especially instituted.
Six staff members were infected with injuries.
In our prisons, we do not tolerate violence and it is clear that those responsible for it will be transferred to the police and can spend longer on the networks."
Long Larsin prison has more than 500 prisons, including some of the most dangerous dealers in the country.
In June it was announced that the prison director had completed his arrest in the hospital.
And in October, they were sent to prison by regular units because of serious disturbances in which the staff was attacked by bullet holes.
Hurikán Rosa threatens the natives of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is not unusual for Arizona to experience a tropical storm of low pressure, but it is likely to occur at the beginning of the next week when the remaining energy of the Rosa hurricane is overcome by desert drought and brings the risk of flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued alerts to the islands on Monday and Tuesday from West Arizona for southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will get out on the street on Tuesday and bring rain on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix on Twitter stated that “from 1950 only ten tropic cycles were kept in the distance to 320 km from Phoenix’s tropical storm status or pressure down!
Katrina (1967) was still 64 km from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Centre for Horicans are 50 to 100 mm, in the area of Mogollon Rome in Arizona, up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the desert north-west, including the middle of the Skalalist Mountains and the Great Sea, it is likely to fall 25 to 50 mm, with local corners up to 100 mm.
For those who don't threaten the coastal waters, the rain of Rossy can be a blessing because the area is dry.
Floods are quite a serious thing, but these rays may help because the South American is just stuck dry.
The server weather.com claims that according to the U.S. Drought Monitor service, Arizona is operating more than 40 % at least "extreme dry", which is the second highest category.
The trip to Hurican Ross is the first to take you to the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still with the maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move 19 km/h north.
Then the storm meets with the coldest waters of the Pacific Ocean, and then it loses power.
It is expected to arrive in Mexico in the afternoon or in the evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico there will be strong conflicts, which represent a great risk of flooding.
"In the area of Baja California after the northwestern Sonor, total ranges of 75 to 150 mm are expected, which can be extended to 250 mm," says the server weather.com.
Rosa then looks like a tropical storm across Mexico north and arrives at the Arizona border on Tuesday morning. Then he passes through Arizona, and on Tuesday evening he enters the southern Utah.
"It is expected that the main risk of Rosy or its remnants will be very strong in Baja California, the northwestern Sunsor and the desert south of the United States," the National Centre for Horikans reports.
These waters are expected to cause deadly dangerous evaporation and floods in deserts and droughts of land in the Horn.
Flight to Midsomer Norton: Four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three kidnappings of boys and 20-year-old men were arrested for suspects of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The wounded boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4:00 a.m.
He was transferred to the hospital and his condition is now "stable".
As reported by the police from Avon and Somerset. Young men between the ages of 17 and 20 were detained at night in the area of Radstock.
The police are looking for witnesses who could have on the phone a record of what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has tried injustice and addiction" Democrats
"The voice of Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the independent and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a seminar in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump stated that during the process of his nomination, Kavanaugh "has tried injustice and a relationship" with the Democratic Party.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh spoke before Congress, where he strongly and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford’s order that she had been sexually assaulted ten years ago when she was a teenager.
She also told Ford about her charges.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day “the American witnesses of Kavanaugh were great and good qualities and courage”.
The representative of his representatives from West Virginia said that “the vote of the judge of Kavanaugha is the confirmation of one of the greatest legal brains of our time, a lawyer who has an excellent public service account”.
The president pointed out to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about how important it is for the Republicans to take part in the elections in half of the functional period.
"Five weeks ago one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not candidates, but I'm still moving," he said.
"That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
The trumpet announced that the Democrats had decided to "response and arrest".
The Executive Director of the Republican Party told the CNN station that the first key procedural vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh at the end of the session is expected on Friday at the latest.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia killed hundreds of people and the number of victims continues to grow
The authorities announced on Saturday that after the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by widespread earthquakes and tsunamis, at least 384 people came to life, many of which were destroyed by huge waves that sailed the beaches.
On the beach in the city of Palu, hundreds of people came to the festival on Friday, and the beaches were covered with up to six feet [6 m] of waves that killed many people and destroyed everything they had left on their way.
There was an earthquake at 7.5 degrees.
"When the threat of tsunamis appeared yesterday, people continued in the activities on the beach and immediately did not run away, so they fell for the victim," said the Indonesian Agency for the reconciliation of the BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in the Jakart.
"The wave did not go alone, carried a car, clothes, homes, and spread everything on the ground," Nugro said, adding that the wave spreads at 800 km/h before the surface of the sea.
He indicated that some people had fled to the trees and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency for the repair of the cave show many destroyed buildings and shops, decorated and red bridges and a mixture of water covered.
The results reached the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
In its statement, the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) indicated that the energy released by the flagship winds was about 200 times greater than the power of nuclear bombs imposed by the second world war on Hiroshima.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow steps, which could even increase the flow of tobacco.
Nugroho described the damage as "distributive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had arrived.
He mentioned that the bodies of some victims were found locked under the roofs of damaged buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho reported that the number of victims and damages could be larger on the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the area called Dodrea, which is close to the earthquake epicenter.
According to him, the communication "was simply protected without any information" from Dongry.
In his statement, the Red Cross indicated that more than 300,000 people live in the area and added that his workers and volunteers measure to the affected places.
"It's a tragedy, but it could still be a lot worse," says the statement.
The agency expected considerable criticism on Saturday because it did not report that Palu had been infected with tuberculosis, even though the authorities indicated that wolves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
At the amateur clubs shared in social media, it is to hear a man in the upper floor of the building defends people on the street before approaching the tsunamis.
Within a few minutes, the coast will engulf the water wall that brings the buildings and the car.
Agency Reuters was not able to check the record immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major electric accident that disturbed communication around Pala, so the authorities could coordinate only very difficult rescue work.
According to the military authorities, they started sending commercial aircraft from Jakarty and other cities, but evacuation people still need food and other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened only for the transport of aid and remained closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo had to visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Saturday.
The number of Tsunami victims in Indonesia increased to over 800.
That's very bad.
When workers from the World Vision organization from Dongry arrived in the city of Paul, where employees were hiding in the closets of the office building building, they saw pictures of stories, says Mr. Doseb.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he adds.
It's very bad.
When relief groups engaged in relief work during disasters, some of them complained that foreign workers were not to come to Paul with great experience.
According to the Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staff from abroad may begin at the site of the disaster until the declared zone of national disasters is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the province level," says Indonesian Red Cross spokesman Aulia Ariani.
"When the government says 'OK, this is a national disaster', we can start international aid, but it's not yet."
When Paul was born the second night after the fifth earthquake and tsunamis, friends and friends of those who are still unaware of it, they still hoped that their love for him would be the miracles that remove the sad history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, they got out of the little boy's canal.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been imprisoned for two days at the expense of her mother's body.
Gendon Subbandon, a coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglidists in the Asian game that ended this month in Indonesia.
Other people in Roa Roa Roa's hotel, including Mr. Mandiga, were his students.
"As a person who has been paralyzed for a long time, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Mr. Gendon cured how in the hours that followed after the paragliding community learned about the collapse of Roa Roa's hotel, he hoped to send a message through whatsApp contestants from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages, instead of the two blues, ended with a seat sign.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he says.
The thieves took $26,750 while filling up the banknote in Newport on the Level
According to the press report of the Newport police department, the theft of 26,750 USD of Brink's employees in Newport on the Level was suspended on Friday.
As Dr. Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the driver of the car was throwing up the banknotes in the entertainment complex and preparing to put another money into it.
When he did that, another man ran away from Brink's company employee and stole the wallet with the money that was supposed to be put into the banknote.
According to the press report, several suspects who had fled the scene, but the police did not interrupt the number of people involved in the incidents.
Please inform the police in Newport of the identity of suspects in numbers 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Raper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changes its name – on Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote: "Beast is formally known as Kanye West."
The 14-year-old West has a preview of Ye for some time and a pseudonym used as the name of his personal album, which went out in June.
The change comes before his show on Saturday Night Live, where he should bring up his new Yandhi album.
In the show, the singer, Arian Grande, who withdrew his participation for "study reasons", as indicated by the series's form.
West has already said that the word for him has nothing but the shortness of the current professional name and religious significance.
“In my opinion, ‘yes’ is the most used word in the Bible, which means ‘ty’,’” West was allowed to hear about the beginning of the year when he talked about his album with the vocal modator Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye – as a reflection of our good, our evil, our vengeance, everything.
The album is such a reflection of who we are,"
The name has also changed a number of other famous rappers.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy in various periods, but this year he announced that he gave priority to the names Love (love) and Brother Love (brotherly love).
Former West's associate JAY-Z also wrote his name aloud with and without him and large and small letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use the army against civilians
On the occasion of the near 50th anniversary of the bloody conspiracy against the students, the newly elected Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador insisted that he never use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador, on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, promised that "he will never use the army to attack a Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, when a left student riot spread throughout Latin America, soldiers started shooting people at a peaceful demonstration in the city and killed up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those studying and opening up other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunity to teach young people would lead to criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding artificial intelligence
According to the investor and expert on the art intelligence Kai-Fu Leee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of art intelligence (AI) and the United States should double the amount they spend on research in this area.
The comment comes after the various parts of the US government have published an AI announcement, although the USA as a whole does not have any formal intelligence strategy.
In the meantime, China has set up a plan to be one in innovative AI by 2030.
"The double budget for the AI research would be a good start since all the other countries are much longer than the US and we are looking for another half in the AI," says Lee.
In his speech to the CNBC this week, Lee indicated that double funding could double the chances that the next big show in the AI area will be made in the USA.
Lee, who released this month at Hughton Mifflin Harcourt in charge of his book “Supervelmoci AI: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order”, is the director-general of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most significant AI companies in China, Face+.
At the University of Carnegie Mellon University in the '80s, he worked on the AI system that defeated the best American player in Othello's game, and later he was the leading employee of Microsoft and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee assessed previous US government technological competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge Agency Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when else to help identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
"Academic chips don't take China, but corporations," says Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies have been employed in recent years by the best university professionals to work on art intelligence.
In order to improve efforts in the AI area, assistance and changes in immigration policy could also be seen in the United States of America.
“I think doctors in the AI should be automatically offered green cards,” he says.
The National Council of China issued the Plan for the Development of artificial intelligence of the new generation in July 2017.
China's National Sciences Administration provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way as the National Science Council and other government organizations spend money on researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is higher in China, says Lee.
The U.S. Defence Ministry established the Joint Intelligence Centre this year, which should involve partners from the industry and the academic environment, and the White House announced the establishment of the Committee on the Art of Intelligence.
And the DARPA agency announced this month that it invests $2 billion in initiatives called AI Next.
With regard to the transfer of NSF, the AI now invests more than $100 million annually.
The United States legislation, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for the Art of Intelligence, has failed for a number of months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum if they want to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in the referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to the Northern Macedonia Republic, which would resolve several decades of old conflict with Greece, blocking the application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has the province of Macedonia and claims that the name of the northern neighbour is a lie on its territory, and therefore Macedonia has been forced into NATO and the EU.
Both governments concluded in June the proposed new name agreement, but the nationalist advocates suggest that the change weakens the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slovenian population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that there would be no vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for the vote raised doubts as to whether there would be at least 50 per cent of the voters required for the referendum to be paid.
The question in the referendum was, "Are you for NATO and EU member states with the coming agreement with Greece?"
The list of amendments to the name, including President Zoran Zaeva, claims that it is the price to pay for Macedonia, one of the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia. It could enter the EU and NATO organisation.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," says 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska from Skopje.
The referendum is not binding at all, but enough Members of Parliament said they would be led by the vote.
The change in the name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The National Electoral Commission indicated that no problems had been reported until 13 hours.
The voluntary participation was also only 16 per cent of the total turnover of 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters were finally elected.
"I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko are voting in the Macedonian referendum on a change of name, which would open the country's way to NATO and the European Union, in Strucica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small podium before the Parliament in Skopje and sits in front of the status of the people who fight against the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with a head-down door, not a service door," Kavadarkov says.
"We are poor countries, but we have our pride.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to another, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Association."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%, so needed investment.
"I think the great majority will be for, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
The result of "an" would, according to him, be "a belief in our future".
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, the referendum could be attended between 30 and 43 per cent of voters – which is less than the required participation.
In another study conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV station, it was found that 57 per cent of respondents were willing to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they'd like to.
To make a referendum successful, 50 per cent plus one voter must participate.
The failure of the referendum would mean the first serious threat to Western governments' policies since its accession to the Union in May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City came to the head through the entire defence of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were defending Brighton on Saturday, and they thus won Manchester City 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In the administration of Aguera, his head appeared slightly light in 65 minutes.
It all started with the game that the Argentine attacker got in the middle of the field.
He spread between the three Brilliant defenses and reached an open space.
Aguera then wore four green clothes.
At the end of Brighton's port territory, he had one suit and a few more forwards.
The next player on the left found Sterling.
The English attacker attacked a sword in the coastal territory back to Aguero, who, by the way, convinced the banker Brighton Mathewa Ryan to shoot at the right side of the network.
"Aguero has foot problems," reported the reporters of the City Pep Guardiola.
"We said it would be 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's how it was.
We were lucky to have a head in that moment."
The initial benefit for Sky Blues in this game Premier League but arranged Sterling.
This cave fell in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a sword deep in Brighton's territory.
On the left, he sent a beautiful sword to Leroy Sane.
The dream worked out the sword and then sent Sterling to a remote village.
Lieutenant Sky Blues has locked a sword into the network tighter than he's locked out of the fireplace.
The city will play on Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffenheim in a team of Masters Leagues at the Rhine-Neckar-Arena Stadium in the German Sinsheim.
The player wants to be happy Rockies
When the Nationals were ordered out of the game on play-off, there were not many reasons to resume.
But the competing Scherzer hopes that on Sunday he will be placed as a player in the game against Colorado Rockies – only when they will have Rockies, who will lead to the NL West on one game over Los Angeles Dodgers, hope for play-off.
Rockies won at least a wild card at least 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to get their first title in the division.
"Even if we don't play anything, at least we can start because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the second team will probably play with the greatest effort I've ever had this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in that?"
The Nationals have not yet reported who will start on Sunday, but apparently they are inclined to insist on Scherzer for such a situation.
For Scherzer, it would be the 34th start. On Thursday, he would train and repeat on Sunday when he was usually free.
The right-wing Washington has 18-7 with 2,53 ERAs and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 variables in this season.
The trumpet appeared at a meeting in West Virginia
The President immediately addressed the situation around his candidate to the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh when he spoke about how important it is for the Republicans to take part in the election in half of the functional period.
"In November, everything we've done will be in good shape.
One of the most important choices in our lives is five weeks.
It's one of the great, great – I'm not candidate, but we're still moving and I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
The trumpet continued: “You see this fierce, vicious group of Democrats, you see that is happening right now.
And they're determined to take the power through any necessary means, you see the futility, resistance.
There's one person who's hurt, who has to move to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we don't give them."
According to him, the Democrats decided to "response and constituencies".
"And you see it in the last four days," he added, saying that the Democrats are "inflammation and hatred and evil and denial."
He mentioned on behalf of the senior member of the Senate Justice Commission, democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which led to the vote on the motion for a resolution.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Uhm, what?
No, no, wait, it was a really bad word of the body -- the worst word of the body I've ever seen."
The labyrinth is no longer a fragment of opinion.
It's intolerance to those who express their views
When the activists from Moment on my local side voted for my memo, it was no surprise.
Finally, I am the last of a series of lab MPs who said they were not welcome – because they said their opinion correctly.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, in my memory, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, paradoxically similar issues which Jeremiah did not agree with previous leaders.
In the Noticeham East report on the five-year-old labyrinth meeting, it was written that "we want the meetings to be accessible and productive."
Most of the eight years that I was a local member of Parliament on the laboratory side, the GC meetings on Friday evening were exactly like that.
In today’s world, so much of the regret is unsatisfied and the promise of a “faster, more tenderer” policy has been long forgotten if it has ever started with him.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated on the labyrinth side and every opinion is taken into account whether it is acceptable to guide the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became my leader, and colleagues whom I had previously thought we had similar political views suddenly expected me to turn 180° and stop positions that I could not otherwise agree with – whether it is national security or the single EU market.
Whenever I talk to the public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – then follows the harassment on social networks where they call for my call, withdraw the central policy and tell me that I shouldn’t be on a labyrinth.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues, because comments tend to be political.
I have respect for the professional and decision-making of my colleagues who have been subjected to sessistic or racist attacks every day, but they never come in.
One of the aspects of this era of politics, from which I am most vulnerable, is how the attacks become standard.
Jeremy Corbyn announced last week that the Laborist Party should pursue a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer in this fragmented opinion and with every proposal to express mistrust or change the rules of choice, the party becomes more restrictive.
In the last two years, I've been working so many times to keep myself back, so I didn't call and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since I entered the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student of the school, the failure of the government of Margaret Thatcher, who has allowed my class of general schools to fall apart has been a matter of fact, I have tried to fight for better public service for those who need it most — whether as a local worker or a government minister.
I've never been hiding my policy, even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could ever be surprised by my political positions and areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
Those who supported this proposal on Friday only say that when the country sells to Brexit, which damages households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the urge to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Laborist Party.
My main message is not a moment in Nottingham, but to my constituents whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of calling or political pragmatism will prevent me from acting according to what I think is the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undiscovered Ayr steps to the top
Two late Fridays brought some final results, but there's no doubt that Ayr earned himself in this great fun game of Tennt's Premiership triumph.
Now they're on the top of the table, like the only non-smoker.
Finally, it was an excellent defense and better use of the chance that helped home to win, and Peter Murchie's sword had the full right to be at peace.
"In our games we have passed great tests and we are still not disappointed, so I must be happy," he says.
Robin Christie from Melrose says, "All honor to Ayru, the chances are better than us."
Grant Anderson's fifth in 14 minutes, changed by Frazier climate, sent Ayr to the front, but a yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, who released the Warriors for the game, enabled Melrose to use the number change and Jason Baggot received an unchanged five.
The climate has increased the control of Ayru criminal and then changed the solar test in time to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half good and Patrick Anderson's fifth, changed to Baggot, reduced leadership to five points.
Then there was further detention because of the serious injuries of Ruaridha Knott, who left the nest on the boots, and when he started playing again, Ayr re-suspended on the five Stafford McDowalls who changed the climate.
Deputy Captain Ayru Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and Melrose again used players in addition to the unchanged five Bruce Colvin after a short strong pressure.
The housekeepers also returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow for the attack on the Air without a sword, MacPherson from the criminal order put the sword behind the moving little Ayre.
He changed the climate, almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe caught the head of David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry's wing for five homes.
The Still Game star plays a new career in hospitality
It appears that the star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series is moving into the guest's field. It has been found to be named by the director of the licensed restaurant company.
Sixteen-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in a popular BBC series that he writes and plays with long-term comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the upcoming nine series would be the last series of series, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglag.
According to an official register, the Director of the Company Agymorn Limited is the Director of the Company.
Herec refused to comment, but the source of the Scottish Sun data indicated that Kiernan wants to join the "progressive business in restaurants" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": inland Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
The seamen are watching for the marine leadership in La Paz, which is decorated with salmon.
Over public buildings, the blue train rides in the ocean color.
The seabeds of Lake Titicaca for Amazon are described as: “The sea is our right.
It's our duty to find him."
Throughout Bolivia, there is still a living memory on the coast that has lost the country in the favor of Chile in the 19th century's bloody war on sources – just as it is a burden to re-wind the Pacific again.
These trends may be the biggest for several decades because Bolivia is waiting for a decision of the International Court of Justice which should fall on 1 October after five years of imprisonment.
"Bolivies have energy, spirit of unity and calm and of course expect a positive outcome," says Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will follow the MSD decision on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide in favour of the Bolivian claim that, after many decades of interruptions, Chile has to agree that Bolivia will provide sovereign access to the sea.
Charismatic Homeland President Bolivia Evo Morales, who has before him a controversial battle for the renewal of the next year, is also of great interest in the decision on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court would decide in favor of Bolivia – and even if it did, it would not change much.
This UN body, sitting in the Netherlands, has no power to adapt to any Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the MSD decision will only come six months after the last arguments have been made shows that the case was 'not complex', as Paz Zarate says, the Chilean expert on international law.
And in the last four years, not only did Bolivia not support it, but maybe they did it worse.
"The question of access to the sea has been strengthened by the existing Bolivian government," Zarate says.
It adds that Morales' attack retort has weakened all remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will once again be united, but after this it will be extremely difficult to hold a discussion.
Both countries have not changed their terms since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltz, the representative of Bolivia in Haagu, rejected the idea that the decision of the court was not usually rapid.
Monday it will bring Bolivia "a great opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and the chance to "end of 139 years of conflict with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – would use the question of the sea as a political barrier.
"Bolivia never assumes its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to find out that we have to deal with the past."
North Korea says he won't come to nuclear disarmament unless he's able to trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his people never fight their nuclear weapons as first, if they can't believe Washington
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called the United States to fulfil the promises given to the summaries of the leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment is coming after what seems to be the US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo is trying to restart the nuclear diplomacy, which took place on the dead end, more than three months for Singapore's meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Unem.
Ri says it's a "planout they hope" that the ongoing sanctions and the US's intention against the declaration of the end of the Korean war could sometimes strike the North on the knees.
Washington is careful with regard to the agreement with the declaration if Pchjongjang does not first make significant steps towards disarmament.
Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
It is also general scepticism that Pchjongjang seriously thinks that this arsonal will be said to be probably the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo wants to visit Pchjongjang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trup Summit.
Paris Reviews show that your fashion trades will soon reach the latest trend in the size of the head coverings
If you want to expand your collection of cookies or completely block the sun, your search is over.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of broken huge head coverings for their summer/year 2019 collection to a viewer who had captured everyone at the Paris Week.
Very unheard-of-the-art clowns sailed into Instagram this summer and these designers sent their rising creatures to the ground.
Valentina's eyebrows were covered with a large cap with a large cap that reminded the head of the model.
Other large supplements were decorated with melons, magic knobs, and even pineapples – but they are not intended to warm the head.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange masks – and just on Halloween.
Many of the pestrobaric masks have the protection of the teeth and remember Hannibal Lecter better than the high fashion.
One was reminded of subterranean equipment and with snorch and glasses, while the other looked like a cornnut with a thick cold.
And if you're able to move on with the size, you're lucky.
Modal experts predict that giant chips could even reach trade with fashion.
The grown-up clowns come after "La Bomba", a sleigh with half a meter wide, which they all brought from Rihanny to Emily Rattakowski.
The cultural sign behind this very unprofessional clout, which swept through the social media, sent a visual image of another size creation – a fallen beach bag, which is almost as big as a model in the lungs that carry it.
The dark orange ware bag of raffles with raffic trimmings and a white-haired handle was at the Parisian fashion week with the exhibition of La Riviera jaro/year 2019 from Jacquemuse.
A celebrator Luke Armitage said to the FEMAIL: “I expect great clasps and beach bags to appear in fashion shops for the next year – given the success of the designer with them, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for too large supplements."
John Edward: Language skills are necessary for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have a number of academic achievements, and they continue with further outstanding results in 2018. Individual and group success in sports, art, music and other community activities only supports this.
These schools have more than 30,000 pupils throughout Scotland, the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) is represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and seeks to ensure the best level of service for their pupils and parents.
Independent schools prepare their demands for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as world citizens.
As the education sector, which can propose and implement individually adapted educational plans, we note that modern languages are still popular and requested in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in a language that he understands, that goes directly to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes directly to his heart."
It is a major concern that if we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries, we cannot rely solely on English.
The latest results of the annual trials show that languages are at the top of the table, with no higher degree of success having independent schools.
Nearly 68 percent of people who have learned a foreign language have achieved the best sign A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that the highest score A reached 72 per cent of Manarinstin, 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will need in the future without doubt.
Languages such as subjects that love themselves are in the study plans of independent schools as well as those of STEM (knowledge, technology, technical fields and mathematics).
A study carried out by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that for reasons that employees pose as problems in the provision of free places, 17 per cent of their language skills are insufficient.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future career.
Given that more and more labour opportunities require languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
If a person chooses any career, if he learns another language, he will have in the future the real benefit of having such a lifelong experience.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, people are getting more and more languages automatically benefit from competition.
According to a study conducted by YouGov in 2013, among 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75 percent of them did not speak a foreign language sufficiently well enough to be able to communicate, while the only language spoken by two-digit percent of people was French.
It is therefore important for today's children to invest in learning languages.
If children learn more languages, especially those of developing economies, they will have a greater chance of finding meaningful employment.
Every school in Scotland has its own language.
The school is focusing on more classic modern languages, while others learn languages that are considered to be the most important for Great Britain by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Even if the child is already interested in anything, he will always have independent schools to choose from a number of languages with students who are in a given field of experts.
Scottish independent schools are committed to ensuring the educational environment that children prepare and provide them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever they are in the future.
At this point, it cannot be said that languages are essential for the future of the country in the global business environment, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should, in fact, be considered "International Communication Skills."
Independent schools will be young people in Scotland and continue to offer this choice, variety and significance.
You need to do it.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will first introduce himself on Sunday in San Diego at Lakers
Fanos who are happy when LeBron James first arrives for Los Angeles Lakers, they're ready to wait.
The Lakers Luke Walton announced that James will be playing in the Sunday opening game in San Diego against Denver Nuggets.
But it's still not clear how many minutes he plays.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James probably only plays a limited number of minutes.
The last week after the train, James asked for his plans for six Lakers games in the Presbyterian.
"In this phase of my career, I do not need pre-session sports," he said.
Trup's appearance in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts the campaign at Wheeling in West Virginia tonight.
It's the first of five minutes planned for next week, including a stop at friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the suspension of the vote on his candidate's admission to a position at the Supreme Court, Trump wishes to receive support for the upcoming elections in half of the mandate, as the Republicans are in the November elections before the risk of the loss of Congress.
How many hours does Trump start tonight and how can you watch him online?
The Trompo assembly in Wheeling in West Virginia is planned at 19:00 east time, today on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
Trump's myth in West Virginia can be watched online below by means of live transport to YouTube.
The trumpet will probably talk about hearing a candidate to the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh, who spent this week and was very busy because of the accusation of inappropriate sexual conduct. It is expected that the signing vote of the Senate will be postponed for one week before the trial of the FBI.
But the main aim of this wave of mittens is to help the Republicans increase their pace before the November elections.
According to the Reuters campaign organizers, President Trupa says that these five meetings in the coming week are aimed at "adding energy to volunteers and supporters so that the Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority of those in the Senate and the Snow Representative".
"The control over the Senate is so important to his agency that the president will take the campaign to the largest number of states in this Russian season," said the Reuters agency of the Trump campaign, which did not intend to be named.
According to West Virginia Metro News, supporters from "Ohia and Pennsylvania and the media from Pittsburgh" could come to Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling today.
On Saturday, this will be the afternoon in the last month, when Trump visits West Virginia, where he received more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the Senate for West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is staying in the trials.
"For Morrisey there is no good sign that the president must come to help him in his studies," says the agency Reuters Politologist at the University of Zapadovirgin.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team showed he has to fight for hope before Sunday singles
After three single flights, the Saturday couple can be exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
It's a pretty clever sport concept, but its players really believe it, and most of all, it's just on such competitions.
So where's the wire going to go now?
"It's about six points and now it's four, so we're taking it so that the wheel probably moves a little towards us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, is benefiting, leads on four points and still remains twelve.
As Spieth says, the Americans feel they have some wind in the beaches, and there are many things they can awaken, for example the form of Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each can enjoy three points from four.
Spieth was dead when he moved from the pool to the green and went for example.
The cheerleaders still strengthened his car as he managed to get a full match when they were with Thomas for two rounds of two behind him.
His route, which won the game on 15 Jams, met with a similar trap that tells you that the American team is not out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own sport," said Spieth.
That's all each of these players left.
18 yards to leave the foot.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the main story of Ryder Cup.
It's beautiful, but the beautiful two of Europe are four and nothing is wrong.
"Molywood" was the only two that were held on Saturday afternoon, but last Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and again on Friday morning."
This process and the way the energy passes through as a direction to the angry audience, it confirms that these are players for Sunday victory, and that the west of the sun over Le Golf National will not be a more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best two at the same time on a different angle.
However, the words about European glory remain a matter of time.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson had recently worked with Serge García, a brave early game of four matches when he was married to Alex Noren.
Jamka and two pre-neighbours buried Spain and Sweden in ruin, which they had not been able to escape.
But on Sunday no one can help you.
Two-by-two games on two games are so fascinating as you closely follow the interaction between people in pairs, the advice they give themselves, the advice they do not give, and the way the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has been playing better than the team, and until the last day, it has taken a great leap, but this game has also shown that the US team has a hunger for war, which some, especially from the states, have doubted.
On the final day Ryder Cup leads Europe with a score of 10-6 points
Europe will benefit well by the last day of Ryder Cup after two Saturdays on two skis with a 10-6 skiing over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won at least twice as many prizes as Tiger Woods, decided to make four prizes in Le Golf National.
The European side, with Thomas Bjorn two years ago, decided to maintain the trophie they lost in Hazeltine, dominated in the early games on two games with the American side, which took place in series 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four, two games won, but they couldn't get to the deficit.
Jim Furyka's side needs eight points from 12 Sundays to leave the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novel to win four points after him, while he and Molinari, who received the "Moliwood" preview after the weekend, are the first pair to win four points from their four opening games in the history of Ryder Cup.
After the hits of the players Woods and Patrick Reed in the game on two games and then the cold hit the naked Woods and American novelty Bryson Dechambeau even more mature 5&4.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday, showed the occasional flashing games, but now he lost 19 of his 29 games in the game two to two games and seven to row.
Justin Rose, who started the early game on two games, returned to Henrik Stanson's partner in the 2&1 match of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepky - units and triangles in the world's puzzle.
But Europe did not have it in this pleasant fresh day south of Paris on the whole side.
Three-year-old Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas lost for the Americans on Saturday two points.
They gained a strong 2&1 victory over Spain's John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the game on two games and returned later defeating the two Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the game of two, although the first two jacks lost.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup will the team return from the four-digit deficit to the double, although as the challenging Furryko side needs only a delay to win the trophies.
After the second day was the best in two days, it seems that the Sunday opposite was behind them.
North Korea says they don't fight "in no case" alone and without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday that the continued UN sanctions would deepen their lack of confidence in the United States and under such circumstances the country would never take up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said in his annual wave assembly that North Korea has adopted “a significant measure of good will” in recent years, such as the cessation of nuclear and rocket tests, the demolition of nuclear testing sites and promises that nuclear weapons and nuclear technology will not be spread.
"But we do not see the corresponding reactions from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible to fight against one another alone."
While Ri repeated the known North Korean problem with regard to Washington's resistance to the “progressive” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be repatriated for each step, its declaration was considered significant in that it did not refuse unilateral denuclearization only as Pchjongjang had in the past.
Ri mentioned the joint statement issued by Kim Chong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the American President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed to working on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump presented security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea insists on the formal end of the war conflict between 1950 and 53, but the United States said that Pchjongjang must first issue his nuclear weapons.
Washington also called for the release of strong international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US continues to "denuclearise first" and increase the pressure on sanctions to achieve its objectives, and even oppose the "declaration of the end of the war", said Ri.
"I believe that sanctions can bring us to the knees, are dreams of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri didn't mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader highlighted in the UN earlier week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings of Kima and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added: "If, on the other hand, the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come into such a bad situation."
However, the tone of Riho's appearance was dramatically different from that of the late UN conference when he said that the focus of North Korea's rocket on the US territory was inevitable after the "major bad president" Trump marked Kim for "racet man" on a suicide mission.
This year in the UN Tromp, which threatened the "total destruction" of North Korea in last year, commended Kima for her willingness to take steps to rearm, but said that much work must still be done and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is completely denuclearized.
In the middle of Trump said that he had no time frame, he said: “If it lasts for two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reimburse Pchjongjang for the measures taken.
Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo, however, told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue in a variety of ways and without a stand until we are fully aware of the complete, final, verifiable denuclearization"
The Security Council unanimously supports sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to facilitate the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles in Phjongjang.
Pompeo and Ri met at the UN fair meeting on the side of the UN, and Pompeo announced that the next month will visit Pchjongjang to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has not ended well.
He left Pchjongjang in July and announced that progress had been made only in order to declare North Korea a "gangster requirement" within a few hours.
In this month, North Korea committed itself to meeting with Moon to demolize a rocket area and also a nuclear complex, if the United States takes "responsive measures".
He stated that Kim had informed him that "responsive measures", in which he hoped, were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and directed to normalise relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard have a participating course to learn enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has enabled all its students to burn more, and it is in an effort to fight the growing culture of macho studies all night when students do not sleep and wake up with caffeine.
Academics have found that students at the world’s most prestigious university are often unemployed when it comes to the basis of self - care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and a female hospital, which is thought to be his first type in the United States.
He was inspired to start a course after what he presented about the impact of sleep depression on the study.
"At last a girl came to me and said, 'Why do you tell me this first, in my last year?'
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he pointed out for The Telegraph.
The course, which was first presented this year, gives students basic information on how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performances and improve their overall performance.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the executive director of the university's medical services, said that the university decided to take a course after discovering that students were really not exposed during the week.
The hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part, the picture of student bikes, where students click on chairs with coffee, teasing, tennis and books about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of proper space skills.
In the other part, participants are informed of how long-term sleep depression can increase the risk of infarction, death, depression and cancer.
The map of the campaign with interactive icons then shows participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that the conduct of the students will not change immediately.
However, we think they have the right to know - as well as you have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on health," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of "study all night" still exists, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of lack of sleep is growing.
The amount of sleep quality should be a "sustained weapon" of a student for fighting stress, exhaustion and depression, he said - even so that it does not come to the collection, because sleep depression stops the brain from starving, so the person is still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler to propose a course that in the last year, he graduated from one of his classes at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to press the whole course.
It is hoped that the next step will require all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before entering the competition institution.
The professor recommended that students consider the alarm settings when they go to bed as soon as they wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the "moderate light" of electronic images and LED lighting that can spread your circadian rhythm, which leads to problems with drying.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga Popul Gerrard's husband
Rangers suffered another loss when Dr. Dolly Mengy found Stephen Gerard's discomfort with a 1-0 stroke in Livingstone.
Ibrox's side tried to record his first victory from 4th to 1st century triumph at St Johnstone, but the Gary Holt team only caused the second defeat of Gerard in 18 games as manager to leave his post eight points from previous leaders Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes ago, and the Rangers set seemed to be uninspired and determined to fix.
While Rangers are now in the sixth place, Livingston is on the third floor and immediately after the Hibernian team on the same branch.
And it could come to other problems Rangers after what had to be the magic decision-makers Calum Spence cured with head injuries after which the object apparently touched him from the mirror.
Gerard made eight changes to his side, which moved around Ayr to semi-final Bethfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with Livi 11, who had picked up the Hearts for the past week and would have been happy to see how his well-educated masculinity inspired his opponent at every step.
Rangers may have ruled detention, but Livingston did more with the sword on their side.
They were supposed to skin only two minutes after the start when Menga first left Scott Pittman at Allan McGregor, but the baseman buried his great chance.
The Keaghan Jacobse free chief then found Captain Craig Halketta, but his defence partner Alan Lithgow was only able to find out in the final position.
Rangers took control, but it seemed that in the last third, there would be more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he should have a pen for the fourth step when Stephen Lawless was attacked, but decision-makers Steven Thomson made a Colombian challenge from the table.
Rangers managed only two shots for the first half, but former banker Ibrox Liam Kelly was surprised at the head of Lassany Coulibaly and the short shot of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener could have been against the game after 34 minutes, no one can say that they've earned it for the dragon.
Rangers couldn't deal with the deep Jacobs set again.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher sent Scott's sword to Robinson, who was calm and took Meng to the easy end.
Gerard picked up the action and replaced the Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the exchange had almost immediate results when the wing closed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly was afraid of the teasing and the attack was blocked.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to the game exactly the kind they like when Lithgov and Halkett metal one long sword behind another.
The Holt's side could have extended its course in final stages, but McGregor had set himself up well to block Jacobs before Litgow fled from the river.
Lieutenant Rangers Glenn Middleton had another delayed charge of punishment when he asked Jacobs, but Thomson turned back.
German: Vynalezce Geiger's reader
And now a page from our German Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, today is 136 years old, and it still occurs... the day John Wilhelm was born in Germany the future physics "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to a device known as Geiger's reader.
Geiger Counter's science studio also became a permanent pop culture, as in the 1950s "Bells of Coronado", in the main role of these seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What is God's matter?"
Rogers: “It’s Geiger’s reader who is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set up these hearing cells, you can really hear the effects of the atoms that are absorbed by radioactive activity in the minerals.
Evans says, "Well, it's really enough now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the hunter who bears his name is still alive.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify dangerous cells as part of the treatment
Method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation into the laboratory
Then they can see the protein that is common to many cancers and then take another injection.
The test vaccine shows weak results in patients with multiple cancers.
One woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify dangerous cells had cancer for more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from patients, their changes in the laboratory, so they can "see" protein common in many cancers called HER2 and then re-apply to the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute for Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have developed a very weak vaccine."
HER2 "leads the growth of several types of cancer", including breast cancer, ovaries, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach when immunity cells were removed from patients and “learned” was aimed at cancer cells, was already used in the treatment of leukaemia.
Kanye West participated in the pro-trumpov speech, in his hats, and that after his release to SNL.
It wasn't very good.
Kanye West was interviewed in a Saturday Night Live study after a suspected appearance, during which US President Donald Trump said he would apply in 2020.
After singing the third song that evening with the name Ghost Town, in which he had a cup of Make America Great Again, he started to swim on democracy and withdrew his support from President Trump.
“And I speak to the white ones, and they say, ‘How can you only like Trump, because he is a racist?’
If I were to lead racism, I wouldn't be in America for a long time," he said.
The SNL began a parody show with Matte Damon in the main role of the Hollywood star to play with the testimony of Bretta Kavanaugh before the Senate court committee on the charge of rape of Christine Blasey Fordó.
Although this was not sent, West's theater talks were recorded on social media by the comicper Chris Rock.
It's not clear whether Rock tried to laugh at West.
The West also made the surprises that he had a good haircut in his backyard.
"I was shot in the backyard.
They said, "Don't go there with that hat."
It's a joke!
They also said I was in the wrong place," said the Washington Examiner newspaper.
West continued, "Do you want to see the wrong place?" and added that "He'd set up his superman suit, because that means you can't say what I'm supposed to do." Do you want the world to move ahead?
Try love."
His comments served only twice, and the SNL members seemed upset, saying Variety, and one person even said: “The whole studio was completely quiet. ”
Westa was invited as a late reward for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
The West defeated many neighbors by singing a song I Love moved by Perrier's lattice.
The West received support from the leading conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the most important characters: DEVELOPMENT, which you have done.”
But a host talk show Karen Hunter on Twitter wrote that West was "only the one who is, and that's just amazing."
"But I DON't want to hire someone (by buying his music or his dress or by supporting his 'mechanism'), who I believe is representing and sending to the world of ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Like us," she added.
Before the show, rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name and said he's now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist who changed his name and goes to Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
colleague rapper, Snoop Dogg, previously named Snoop Lion and, of course, the music legend Prince, changed his name to symbol and then artists previously known as Prince.

Play Thrones Star Kit Harrington dropped into toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jona Snow with a sword in his hand in violent medium-time fantasy HBO series.
Herec, 31 years old, however, emerged from the stereotype of a small brain and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often have to feel that they must be strong to serve respect.
The Sunday Times Culture Kit said he believes that "something is wrong" and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his star on Rose Leslie's throne, also 31 admitted that this problem is "too strong".
"At this moment I feel personally, quite strongly - what happened to the masculinity so bad?" he said.
"What do we teach mature men about the problem we see here now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic men thanks to my very male attitude.
He continued: “What is born and what is learned?
What does the boy learn on television, on the streets, from the feeling that every man should have his own page?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time - how to change it?
Because a young man must have changed something to the worse.
He also agreed that he would not play in any past or series of games after the series is finished, because he already has a lot of "wars and horses".
From November, Kit will play in the renewed legal West Sam Shepard, which is the story of the film producer and his brother, the doll.
Herec recently left that meeting with his current wife, Rose, for the best of the game.
"I met my wife at the time of the series, so he gave me my future family and my whole life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, an object of love of Kitto's position by Jon Snow, in this fantasy of the series prized by Emmy.
A couple took place in June 2018 in the lands of Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China indicates 14% growth in new cases
China reported 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official figures, more than 820,000 people have been reached in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases were transmitted by sex, which meant a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads across some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have been infected with HIV this way has been reduced almost to zero, bringing Chinese doctors to a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 per year.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still apparently widespread.
In view of the conservative values of countries, studies estimate that 70-90% of men having sex with men eventually become women.
Many of the abuses result from lack of sexual protection in these stages.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has facilitated universal access to HIV treatment as part of the efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters argues that the staff would let go of the data of the GOP senators, reversing the terms "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theory"
On Saturday, the US delegation of Maxine Waters rejected the claim that a member of her employees had sent personal data from three U.S. senators to lawmakers.
A Democrat from Los Angeles claimed that the charge was supported by “super-rights” scientists and websites.
"Lie, lie and other disgusting lies," said Waters in his statement on Twitter.
This information was clearly included in the addresses of home and telephone numbers for American senators. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information was published on Thursday on the Internet and published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate's trial of sexual abuse by the candidate of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh.
There was a time when three senators were listening to Kavanaugh.
Conservative pages such as Gateway Pundit and RedState announced that the IP address, which is a source of contributions, is connected with Waters Office and has published information on the staff of Waters, says Hill.
"This unsubstantiated claim is simply a false and absolute lie," Waters continued.
‘The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were threatened because of these false and false accusations - was not in any case responsible for the failure of the information.
This unsubstantiated claim is simply a false and absolute lie."
Water's statement quickly served as an online criticism, including that from the former printer secretary of the White House of Ariof Flescher.
"This confusion is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This means that there is no temperature to be a member of Congress."
If someone's accused of something he didn't do, he can't get hurt.
It's not supposed to be weird.
There's no need to question the motives of the complainant.
He must be calm and do not get upset."
It seemed that Fleischer compared the reaction of Waters to the criticism of Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who criticized him for being too upset during the fourth hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who participated in the election against Waters, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it were true, it would be something," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters stated that her office had warned “the competent authorities and authorities acting in criminal proceedings on these double orders.
"Let's take care to be honest," she continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to everyone and all my staff."
Johnny English reopens reviews – poor spy parody Rowan Atkinson
It is now common to look for Brexit in every new film with a British trend, which seems to be the case of this Johnny English rebirth in the series of action parodys - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this still satirate on the issue of how obviously we are a bad nation, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this accomplished, non-compliant Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to repack this thing in a completely new way - a name more than any other sign that the wide comics are intended for non-English-speaking cinematographic audiences.
He is of course the dumb secret agent who, despite his strange jokes on the smoothie glamour, has a little bit from Inspector Clouseau, a spy from Mr. Bean and a big kisser of that guy who burned the only tone in the Chariots of Fire at the beginning of the Olympic Games in London 2012.
The statute is also originally based on the traveler and international secret man Atkinson once played in the already forgotten television commercials Barclaycard, who left behind chaos.
In this last issue there are one or two beautiful moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter in the middle of the fire, and the rotor's head soon jumped about his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for the physical comedy is displayed, but humor is quite underestimated and seemingly excessive, especially when "serious" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comedians as a certain component of their production.
Humor is more like a child than an adult, and for me, Johnny's crazy trampods are as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film gangs in Mr. Bean's person.
The constant current assumption is that Great Britain has serious problems.
The cybernetic hacker infiltrates the British super-thin web network of spies and detachs the identity of all British agents in the field, to scare an agent in the service - to a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last summit for the prime minister, which is a cohesive and busy establishment that is already suffering from the total redundancies of political intolerance: Emma Thompson's joy Theresa May set up the best game, but there's nothing too much in the scenario.
Her reporters inform her that as soon as every active spy of her will be threatened, she will have to get someone back from work.
This means that the only Johnny English who is now employed as a director in some luxury device, but at the same time gives a record lesson about how to be a secret agent: there are a few nice guys here because English offers a Spanish Academy like a rock school.
English went back to Whitehall because of the emergency strike and met with his former long - suffering partner Bough, who was again playing Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man who lives with the boss of the ponor, an infected condition on which the talent of Vicki Pepperdine may also be a little rain.
So Batman and Robin are back in action and they're meeting with the beautiful fetal woman Ophelia Bullet, who played Olga Curylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister is dangerously dependent on a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer crimes: the violent Jason Volt, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their painting with frescoed potatoes: maskings as readers burn the French restaurant; creating chaos when they cross the Volto's luxury jacket; and English releases clean anarchy when they try to get to know the interior of the Volt's house with virtual facts.
All essays are definitely ready for this last sequence, but even if it's more nice and heated, it's got something on the children's television.
It's quite a matter of concern.
And just like other movies of Johnny English, I couldn't stop thinking: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson the role that really corresponds to his talent?
Laborists strive to develop a four-day plan for England to get paid in five days a week
Jeremy Corbin's labist side has to consider a radical plan in which Brits will work four days a week and will be paid five days a week.
The party, of course, would like the chief companies to grant support to the workers who are resulting from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
The employees would enjoy the weekend - but they would still have the same reward.
The source claims that this opinion would "go" to the economic agenda of the party and plan to attract the country to the benefit of workers.
The four-week working week was approved by the Congress of Committee meetings as a way for workers to use changing economies.
The long-term member of the lab stated for Sunday Times: “It is expected that the evaluation of this measure will be notified by the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight, but the four-day working week is an invitation that depends on the position of the party to export the economy in favour of the employee and the entire industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an opinion, the Green Party has joined the four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by the labyrinth as a whole.
“The four-day working week is not our party’s policy and the party does not take it into account,” said the Labour Party’s spokesman.
Stone Chancellor John McDonnell used a working conference last week to complete his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell stated that it was decided to return energy from the "advertising directors" and "signs" to the utility companies.
The plans of the railway station also mean that current operators in water companies should not return to their entire share, as the labor force could carry out "floating" on the basis of a deliberate prosecution.
He also confirmed the plans to place employees in the management councils of the company and to create funds for their own ownership, which transfer 10% of their own capital to employees who are entitled to pay annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said in order "60 minutes", whether the FBI investigation could change their view
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh removed the last vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question of whether finding the office could lead some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a discussion of Sunday's '60 minutes', correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would be appropriate to change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when the charges came up and he said, "Did you do this?"
He was determined, determined, unique."
However , the Graham's decision is inconceivable .
"I have already made my decision over Brett Kavanaugh and would mean it would be a truly explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one: Brett did it hard," added Graham with a reference to Christine Blasey Fordow.
"And none of those she named, could ever believe.
It's been 36 years.
I can't see that something's going to change."
What is this Global Citizen Festival and what did he do to reduce poverty?
In New York this Saturday, the annual event of the Global Citizen Festival, which offers a very dynamic series of stars and the same dynamic mission after the end of the world’s poverty.
In the seventh anniversary of the Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands will meet in Central Park to enjoy not only the artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real target of action, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was announced in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty project, an international group to support the eradication of poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to gain free access to shares (if you were not willing to pay for VIP login), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteers, e-mails to world leaders, telephones or other sensible ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen 12 years ago before he reached his goal?
Is the idea of replacing people with a free concert really how to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case such as "clictivism" - people who feel that signing online petitions or sending tweets is changing?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, more than 19 million "actions" have been registered by its subscribers, trying to achieve different objectives.
It says that these actions have contributed to the announcement by world leaders of commitments and measures of more than $37 billion, which have to affect lives by 2030 more than 2.25 billion people.
By the beginning of 2018, a group of 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the funds provided are already having a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key commitments are the Power of Nutrition project, the British partnership of investors and developers who committed to "help children grow to their full potential", promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help with the country's rise after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, as you are, we can only make a note in history of social injustice,” a spokesman for the Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullmanov said during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also noted that, after more than 5,000 shares called for by the U.K. to improve the survival of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which represents 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on your websites with the question, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
“ It’s going to be a long and hard road, ” the global citizen replied.
But just like the great civil law and the fight against apartheid, we succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae is one of the most effective in New York's annual anniversary, which will host Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the maritime for "blockage", which would prevent Russian energy exports - Minister of the Interior
Washington may, if necessary, hurry to the sea in order to prevent the fall of Russian energy on the markets, including the Middle East, disbanded US Minister within Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria - especially where it leads to the call for legitimate government - is an obstacle to the exploration of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to spend energy as well as in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," he said frankly.
And according to the official declaration, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States has the opportunity to make sure that the maritime routes are open and, where necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy is not on the market," he said.
Markets have expressed actions organised by a consumer energy alliance, which is a non-profit group in the United States that has become a "vote energy consumer".
He compared Washington's approach to contact with Russia and Iran, and noted that they were practical.
"The economic potential for Iran and Russia is mostly investment in or replacement of greenhouse gases," he said, and at the same time calls Russia as a "one-target" player with economic dependence on fossil fuels.
The declaration comes because the Trup administration is on the mission to strengthen the export of its frozen ground oil to Europe and rewarded Russia, which is much easier for European consumers.
To this end, the authorities of the Trompo administration, including American President Donald Trumpa himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to the Trompa, has been made from Berlin "rujmím" Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that North Stream 2's silverware worth $11 billion, which has double capacity to use at 110 billion square meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's hot opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is, for example, by some competitions.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure development tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting with American Energy Minister Rick Perrym in Moscow in September.
The United States was occupied by a position from Germany that reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The largest German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), has called on the United States to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third state is investing in our energy supplies," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angelo Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to "be close" to the presidential candidate in 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren, on Saturday, said that after the elections in half of the electoral period, the candidate "sees close" to the president.
During the workshop in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the candidate.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and make our government break up, including the top woman position," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will be closely watching the presidential candidate."
Warren's meeting also mentioned Donald Trumpa and said that he "will lead this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm afraid to the sea of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was open to his criticism of Trump and his appointment as Supreme Judge Bretta Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said on Twitter: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, the survey published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think she should apply in 2020.
Eighty percent of the "probably" voters from Massachusetts indicated that the senator should not apply, according to a survey of Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidate.
The survey showed increased support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidate, 38 per cent for the candidate and 48 per cent against him.
Among other highly established democratic names, which were discussed in connection with the potential candidate by 2020, was former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll decide officially in January, says Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palina at a meeting with Donald Trumpe
Track Palin, 26, spent one year on the list in Iraq.
On Monday night he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
"What my own son goes through, what goes on after his return, can affect other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some injuries our soldiers return with," said the audience at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulse, Oklahoma.
Palin called this attack "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they return a little differently, they return to their destinations, they return and ask if there is any respect for the things their fellow soldiers and aircraft have done, and every other member of the army is giving his country.
He was arrested on Monday in the city of Vasilla in Aljašce, and charged with domestic violence against the woman, reported Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the police department of Vasilla.
18 States, D.C. supports the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighty states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge of the new US government, which kills asylum victims in front of a gang or domestic violence.
The representatives of the eight states and the five-year period in Washington issued a brief report on Friday to support asylum seekers and refuted this measure, the NCB stated.
The full name of the complainant in the case of Grace v. Sessions, which was not disclosed in August by the American Civil Liberties Organization against Federal Policy.
She said her partner "and his sons and members of violent gang" abused her, but the U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
State attorneys supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
A new asylum policy in the United States has made it possible to request asylum from illegal immigrants who are under domestic violence in 2014.
D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine stated in his fifth statement that the new measure " ignores the decade of state, federal and international law".
"The Federal Law requires that all asylum applications be resolved on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a interruption violates this principle," said a short friend.
Lawyers further specifically argued that policies that deny immigrants' entry are damaging the US economy and say it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "add the necessary work".
The Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered judges in the area of immigration to refrain from making asylum available to victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Azal is available for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," the Sessions said in their statement of 11 June.
Azyl never had to solve all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day throughout the world.
Trusted rescue attempts in Palu, where the number of victims has already doubled, runs in search of survivors with time
To survive, the situation was worse and worse.
"It's very hot," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who enjoyed her hot boyfriend at the center of the evacuation in the city of Palu.
“Every minute the sanitizer will bring another body.
Clean water is normal."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking up stuff and trying to save whatever they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by earthquakes of 7.5 were protected.
Some of the injuries, including Two Haris, who suffered a stroke of the back and shoulders, were recovered from Paluo's military hospital, where patients were treated outside due to continued severe later deaths.
His eyes filled with tears as he felt that violent earthquake had broken into the hotel room in the fifth floor of the room with his wife and daughter.
‘There is no time to save.
I think I've been thrown into prison," said Haris for Associated Press and added that his family was in the city because of the wedding.
"I heard my wife calls for help, but then quietly.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
They're probably all right."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "scanning" propaganda advertising
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-year advertising in the US newspaper, which was committed to the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, an American journalist in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread the propaganda.
American President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned China Daily's tax paid in the Des Moines Register - the state of the biggest sales news in Iowj - after which he accused China of trying to move to the American congressional elections in the United States on 6 November.
The trumpet claim that Peking tried to interfere with the American elections, noted what the American representatives said that the Reuters agency was a new phase of the climbing campaign from Washington to develop pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place commercial promotion ads, Beijing and Washington are currently being buried in the emerging trade war, which is occurring at the level of mutual imports.
The Chinese defence sanctions at the beginning of the trade war were designed to provoke exporters in the states, such as Iowa, who supported the Republican side of Trump, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador in China and former long-term Governor Iow, an important exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Peking hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in his statement in the Sunday Des Moines Register that China now doubles this gap by publishing propaganda advertising in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American currency of the free expression and the free press to place the advertising on Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in the news station on the streets of Beijing, you will find unlimited voices and you will not see any real reflection of the unsound views that China might have on the disturbing economic drive of China, given that the media belongs to the company “Chinese Communist Party”.
He added that "one of the most important Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say what news.
Republicans leave their voters before the elections because of the debate with Kavanaugh, protecting analysts
As many Spanish Republicans challenge the candidate at Supreme Judge Bretta Kavanaug, who faces several accusations of sexual assault, analytics warned that during the upcoming elections in the half-term, they knew the answer, especially from women.
The emotions surrounding this case were extremely high, and most Republicans on the record have already said they want to continue with the vote.
These things can't come back," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell University School in Syracuse.
Reeher said he suspects that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arison) will eventually force the FBI's investigation to calm down the voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday - they don't forget about this tomorrow and not even in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, chief counsellor and speaking group, movedOn, D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors were complaining about "Listod is approaching!" at a meeting in which the Republicans, who are in charge of the judicial commission, decided to call Kavanaugh and through the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, pointed out Mic.
"Democratic promotions and motivations will build records," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People say it was high already, it's true."
However, this could be higher, especially between the growing female voters on the subject and the younger voters, 18 to 29 years of age, who still don't like the president, but often don't go to the elections."
Even before the public testimony, Ford's complaint in detail from the sexual attack on the candidate of the Supreme Court of Analyticals suggested that if the Republicans confirmed, opposition could follow.
"It was a misunderstanding for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote on the committee or the final vote, nor about the fact that Kavanaugh is sitting on the table, it is also about how the Republicans ruled and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, the president of the United States, a group that helps to vote for democracy, pointed to the press channel.
However, the Americans seem to be divided into some of the views that they believe in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's witnesses, with some more sympathy for another named.
A new study from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents were either either determined or likely to believe Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent indicated that Kavanaugh is certain or likely to believe.
In addition, 38 percent indicated that they thought Kavanaugh was probably lying or probably lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the pressure from Flako's FBI at the present time, he investigates the charges raised by Fordem, as well as at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, said The Guardian.
The Ford witnessed before the Senate court committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had been shot by a gun at her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals during her study at Yale University in the '80s.
The World Wide Web browser plans to start a new Internet and advance Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, discoverer of the World Wide Web, starts a campaign that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technological legend project, Inrupt, is a company that is based on the Open Source platform of the Berners-Lee company called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and people have access to information.
In an exclusive conversation with Fast Company Berners-Lee pointed out that the purpose of the Inrupt project is "the world power."
"We have to do it now," he said about this start.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal online database" or POD.
It can include contact lists, work lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Disk Google, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and at all times.
What is on the personal online data is exceptional is that it is entirely up to the user to determine who will have access to any type of information.
The company calls it "personal strengthening through data."
The purpose of the Inrupt project is to provide John Bruce with resources, processes and corresponding skills to help the Solid platform be available to everyone.
At present, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the safety platforms purchased by IBM, some employees working on the project, working on the project and the community of volunteers.
From this week, technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralised applications using tools available on Inrupt websites.
Berners-Lee said he and his team with “Facebook and Google do not talk about making a complete change where all their business models are turned up overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
Berners-Lee, in his contribution to the media published on Saturday, wrote that sending the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid platform website.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Praise of the Spiritual Oslam that received Victoria Krzez during World War I
The triumphs have been years since the only spiritual Church of England gained its victory during the first world war of Victorian cross as a warrior.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann received an assessment on September 29, 1918 at an attack on Bellengles and Lehacourt.
Four days later, however, the shooter killed him, and he never realized that he had won the highest British military rating.
His two grandsons discovered a memorial stone on Saturday at the festival festival in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his lawyers, Michael Vann, said that it was “generally symbolic” that the stone was discovered just 100 years after the victory of his grandfather.
According to the newspaper London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Colonel Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin with a very loud and strong gun from the full work and bullets."
He later reached the first line and, with the "higher angle" line, led the front line before he went to the fireplace and hit three separate units.
Colonel Vanna killed a German shooter on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather's actions were "something I could never do but something that's humiliating."
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, who was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, was imprisoned.
Michael Vann said that "he felt very honored that he could share with the viewer," adding that "the courage of the true heart is shown by the support that many people provide."
The MMA fans stayed all night watching Bellator 206, instead of getting the Peppa trash.
Imagine what you've been waiting all night to watch Bellator 206, just to be released from your main event.
The account from San José contained 13 points, including six on the main map and live transmissions spent all night in Great Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's party, the marvels in Great Britain were surprised when the report changed to the order on Peppa's quest.
Some remained unresolved after the early hours of the morning because of the storm.
One of the fans on Twitter described the change in sending a series for children as "in the form of a bad joke."
"According to the government regulation, such content is not appropriate in the morning and it is therefore necessary to send the order of the children," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president for the marketing and communication of Bellator, after which he was asked about this transfer.
"Peppa rescue," yes.
The president of Bellator Scott Cooker said they would work on the program so that in the future there will be engagement and admiration in Great Britain.
"I think that when I think about sending, we can probably manage it," Cooker said.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday, and we won't do it until Sunday, their afternoon.
But we're doing it.
Believe me, when the program changed, a lot of textman went there and back and not all were just friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But he wasn't, could the government do that.
I promise you it will not happen again.
We cut it into five games instead of six – as we usually do – and we tried to keep the promises to the fans and we couldn't do it.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "minimum" because of sexuality
The Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up with a feeling of inferiority against everything because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize that "all are like him."
On the first disc Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, represented by Lauren Laverne, said that the voice spoke about gay rights to give the other "hope."
He also said that with the opportunity to be with his parents, he was less interested in the Olympic victory.
The regular moderator of the long-term order Kirsty Young had been free for several months because of his disability.
Daley, who appeared as a spender in Lavern's first program, said that he felt "more valuable" than anyone else who grew up like him because "the company wasn't friendly to like you guys and girls."
He said, “These feelings of inferiority and unusualness have been real things that have given me strength and great success.”
He wanted to prove that he was "Someone," he said not to insult anyone who would somehow find out how it is with his sexuality.
A bilateral holder of the bronze Olympic medals became a champion of the law of the LGBT conquest with a high profile and used his presence at the Yearly Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he complained because he had to feel happy that he could live openly without consequences and want to add to the others a “hope”.
This three-year-old world champion stated that his love for a man – American film director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 – “was not prepared.”
Daley, who is 20 years old, took over the last year, but said that the age difference was never a problem.
“When you were so young – at his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died three years later on cancer – he said that it was not easy to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar seizures and falls.
In June, Robert's son, Ray Black-Daley, and Daley, said that he had "changed his whole outlook."
"If you were to ask me a question, it would be all in the style of "I want to get gold medals," he said.
"You know, things are bigger than the gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after his brain cancer was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't mind that he should die, and the last thing he asked was if they had any letters in London Olympics in 2012, because he wanted to be in the previous row.
"I couldn't tell him - you won't be in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and until the moment he stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized that he was not possible," he said.
This year Daley took part in the Olympics in 2012 and won a bronze.
"I knew I had been dreaming about it all my life – to jump in front of the air of our home on Olympic games, I don't know how to feel better," he said.
It also inspired the selection of his first stocks – Proud from Heather Small – which resonated with him at the beginning of the Olympics and continued to cause hair loss.
The Desert Island Discs series is sent to BBC Radio 4 station on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was out of shape, finished on Saturday at Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson would get a record on Sunday when he played 47, the Ryder Cup game, but he would have to take out the form to prevent it from becoming a unhappy hunter.
Mickelson, who played an event known every two years as a record of subcontinent, sent Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday's fourballs and foursomes in the wild.
Instead of being at the center of action, as was often in the United States, he spent his five-year-old main prize on his day running between the dispersioners and the work on the game in a row he hoped he would do what he had suffered.
This 48-year-old player was never the closest of the drivers, and even at the top of his career, so it's not an ideal choice for the Le Golf National castle, where a long member of the ground routinely tortures detonated shots.
And if it's not a golf course alone to worry about itself, Mickelson's head is headed in the ninth Sunday champion of the British Open Francescu Molinarim, who won all four of his games this week in the team with the new Tommy Fleetwood team.
If the Americans, who had four points less, started 12 separate games, avoided a quick approach, the Mickelson sword could have proved to be just as essential.
Furyk expressed his trust in his husband, and he didn't add anything else.
"I just understood the role he had today to pay me back, gave me hand over my shoulder and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"So many believe.
He is a member of China's shame, and in the past, he has been so happy for these teams this week.
I guess I couldn't imagine he was playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else."
Mickelson has won Nick Falda's record in most of the west of Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of the career in Ryder Cup, which never reached the height of his individual record.
Mickelson achieved 18 victories, 20 champions and seven remixes, even though Furyk says his presence to the team has brought certain stupid results.
"It's fun, it's funny, it's funny, it's funny, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun, it'
"I think younger players also enjoyed the fun when they followed him this week, which was fun to watch.
It's more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, from experience, knows that great leadership leading to singles from the last days in Ryder Cup can easily change into an uncomfortable drive.
Data started on the battle in 1997 in Valderrama, where the company led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-way battle over the United States, but reached the goal line with a total of 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
"You must always remember that we had a big jump in Valderrama, as well as in Brooklyn, where we won, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only happily," Bjorn said, on the picture, after watching them win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 Le Golf National.
So history and every member of this team showed me it's not ours.
Tomorrow you'll be completely bored.
Go there and do all the right things.
It's not after you until all those points are on the table.
We have a goal, and that's what we're trying to get here and we're focusing on it.
I said I'm going to focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to stand on the other side – the world's best players."
Bjorn, happy that his players took him to a complex golf course, added: “I would never do that to myself.
We're waiting for other animals tomorrow.
Tomorrow they're preparing individual performances and it's very difficult.
It's great to be out with a partner when it's going well, but when you have to be alone there, your golf player's capacity is fully checked.
It's a message you have to deliver to players, get out of yourself tomorrow's best.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best out of himself as well.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will try to play his players better as individuals than partners. Except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points from four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these great returns when he was part of the victory team in Brooklyn to end up in defeat when Europe reached the "Medina vision".
"I remember every lost word," answered the question, as the 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw raised his players to target the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to start as quickly as in Brooklyn as in Medina.
When this speed goes one direction, they're putting a significant pressure on those averages.
Then we continued our meeting and made sure that the boys felt as if we were going to go out tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to take the opposite and put Rorym McIlroy in the top game with players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, which are the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of boys in this order because I think he's covering the entire road, Bjorn said about his selection of singles.
A new German warship has been relocated
The most recent German marine frigate was recognised in 2014 to replace the ageing warships of the eras of the war, but it will not be available for at least one year due to missing systems and polluted coastal borders.
The launch of the lead ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", a whole new category of Baden-Wuertmberg class frigates, was now based on the Di Zeit of the language-citizen army, which was now deployed in the first half of 2019.
The ship was to be part of the maritime industry in 2014, but the additional problems were resolved after the supplier had been resolved by the ambitious project.
As a reward for the ageing frigates of the Bremen class, four Baden-Wuertmberg vessels will serve as a replacement for the Bremen class, which was ordered by the Navy in 2007.
It is clear that they will be equipped with an effective tool, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft ballistics and certain hidden technologies, such as a reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Another important function involves a long duration of maintenance – it should be possible to set up the latest frigates up to two years outside home facilities.
However, the constant delay means that spicy marine ships, which should be able to send Germany forces into the sea, will be identified by the De Zeit incident.
The F125 frigate was released last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the sea was returned to the ship of manufacturers after surrender.
It was only a little known about the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted a number of fundamental "software errors and the pursuit of war first" tasks that would make the warship useless.
The software activities were particularly important because the Baden-Wuertmberg class ship will carry out a crew of some 120 seafarers – which is half of the workers who needed the Bremen class frigates.
It has also been shown that the ship has a considerable weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of seafarers to add future innovation.
It is believed that 7 000 tonnes of Rhineland-Palfal ship will be twice as difficult as ships similar to those used by the Germans during the second world war.
In addition to the construction of the first stone, the problem is the cost of the whole project – including the training of crews.
It is said that from the original EUR 2.2 billion, the price dropped to the reverse EUR 3.1 billion.
The problems with the most recent frigates have been particularly significant in recent warnings that the German marine power is fragile.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the leader of the German Parliament's defence committee, confirmed that the marine army "are actually arriving on ships capable of landing."
This representative indicated that problems had been dealt with regularly because old ships had been ordered out of operation, but no compensation had been provided.
He complained that none of Baden-Wuertmberg's class frigates are capable of becoming part of the marine crew.
National Trust Organisation addresses the secret life of netapirs
A new research aimed at discovering how netapirs use their country for food is carried out on the site of netapirs in Scotland.
There is hope that research will shed new light on the conduct of unique flight tips and will help to guide future activities for the preservation of this type.
Studies carried out by scientists of the Association National Trust for Scotland will be followed by a net record of stars and at least a long and watery in the Botanical Garden of Inverwe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in the key areas of this site, which will monitor netapir activities throughout the year.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using manual detectors.
A professional sound analysis of all recordings will find the frequency of calls of netapirs and what different types do.
Next will be the map of the apartment and the message that will create a detailed national picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, consultant for the conservation of natural resources for NTS, hopes that the results show which habitat areas are the most important and how different species are used.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the work of the habitat management, such as the construction of a hole, and the best way to maintain the soiled areas and other related species.
In the past century, the population of Scotland and the whole of Great Britain have suffered a great deal.
They are threatened as a result of construction and land development, which affect the colony and the natural environment.
The risk can also represent wind turbines and lighting, as well as the impact on the muscles and chemical healing of building materials and cat attacks.
In fact, the opposites are not blind.
Because they hunt at night, however, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use the eco-location industrial technique for the release of brakes and brakes in the flight.
NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is very serious.
He has trained professionals who regularly carry out tests, colony controls, and sometimes rescue work.
This organisation has even established the first and only prized Neapolitan reservation in the Thurea headquarters in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the 10 types of Neppies in Scotland.
The manager of David Thompson's residence says it's an ideal territory for them.
"We have a great area here in Threave," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and the best habitat.
But it's still too much that we don't know about the outsiders, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand what they need to survive."
It underlines the importance of control of netiers before maintenance work is started in property, as it is possible that an unknown destruction of a single mother nest could kill up to 400 male and young people, which could destroy the entire local population.
They are protection and they are illegal to kill them, force them to destroy, destroy or destroy their colony.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to attach her hand to the work and help.
She said: "We know not how many of our brethren and many others of whom we do not know are their people. We have yet to know."
Ronaldo refuses the charges of rape and his lawyers are going to appeal to the German newspaper
Cristian Ronaldo identified the charges of rape for “false messages” and indicated that people “want to visit” using his name.
His lawyers are willing to appeal to the German lawyer Der Spiegel, who informed them of these charges.
This Portuguese attacker and Juventus was accused of rape by the American Kathryn Mayorgy in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he next paid $375 000 to inform the DA Der Spiegel on Friday about the case of fraud.
A few hours after the release of information on the charges, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers and marked the information for “false messages”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the five-year evaluation holder Gold Mouse into the camera.
"They want to live on my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but it's part of their work.
I'm happy and I'm fine," said the player with a smile.
According to the Reuters agency, Ronald's lawyers are going to charge Dr Spiegel of unsubstantiated charges, which have identified as “unauthorized notification of suspicion in the private area”.
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player will require compensation for “the moral damage in the highest due to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times.”
The event was scheduled to take place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel apartment and at the Las Vegas casino.
After meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga had reportedly returned to hernia, which, according to the documentation given to her in court at Clark County District Court in Nevada, had been attacked anally.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo broke up after the incident and told her that he was "99 per cent" and "one per cent" broken.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for sex, but that he was sensitive.
Majorga also announced that she went to the police and let her photograph of her injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed with the extraordinary arrangement, because she was afraid of taking them away and was afraid of "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman claims that she is now forced to resume the procedure because she is still traumatized by the reported incident.
Ronalda, in the time of the attack, bought a famous Italian juve club from the Real Madrid club from Manchester United and this year he bought it for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain will always suffer the loss of car manufacturers
Great Britain "will always be sorry" if after Brexit it comes to his status as world leader in the production of cars, the secretary for Greg Clark told the company.
He added that it is "anxious" that the Toyota UK car sent the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop the production in the Burnaston race, near Derby.
"The agreement is necessary," said Clark.
The Japanese car indicated that the impact of delays on borders if the Brexit agreement is not concluded can be a job.
In the city of Burnaston, where Auris and Avensis car brands are manufactured, almost 150 000 cars were manufactured in the last year, 90 % of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"My opinion is that if Britain had left the EU at the end of March, we would have recorded the stop of production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnstone.
Other cars, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the United Kingdom, spread fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on the operation of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW indicates that it will close its race for the production of Mini cars in Oxford now month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to the risk identified by manufacturers for the supplier network in the case of Brexit without an agreement.
The Toyota production line is in operation on the basis of a supply "just at the time" provided by suppliers in the United Kingdom and the EU for vehicles manufactured on order within 37 minutes.
If Great Britain left the EU on 29 March without an agreement, it could result in an infringement on the border, which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and lack of remuneration.
For Toyota, it would not be possible to work on the basis of more than one day in Derbyshire, the company introduced, and this would lead to a stop of production.
Mr Clark said that Theresy Mayow's plans to restore future relations with the EU are "climately calibrated so as not to come to these border controls."
"We need the agreement. We want to have the best trade that can, as I say, not only the current success but also the capture of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The evidence from Toyota's company, but also from other producers, is that we must be absolutely able to continue in what is highly successful now the supply chains."
Toyota was not able to say how long the production would be stopped, but from a long-term perspective, it cautions that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the race and in the end also be on the job.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working for 24 years in the Burnaston race and is chairman of the committees in the race, said that the members of the committee are still more concerned: “I have the experience that once these places are gone, they will never return.
The speaking government declared: "We have established a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The Trup's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, leads to the White House
The high-level meeting of Donalda Trump with General Rod Rosenstein's lawyer could be "on next week's departure", because he continues the war on the post of Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh, he sent the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller's Special Council, which investigates the involvement of Russian elections, the relationship between the Trumpo Districts and Russia and the possible judicial restriction by the president.
If the Tromp is already losing its representative general strength and thus endangers Mueller's independence, Washington's locks are already in place for months to come.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the conduct of the camera to record a conversation with the Trupe and the possibility of sitting with the president by addendum 25.
Rosenstein sent a message.
However, on the last Monday, he was sent to the White House surrounded by reports that he was about to give up.
On Thursday, it was announced that the meeting with Trump was then held at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump announced that Rosenstein would not “more than” leave, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid hearing in the Senate trial, where he gave a witness to Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Fordová.
On Friday, the FBI ordered a weekly investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, which resulted in a full vote on the Senate again.
Trup's press spokesman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox channel on Sunday.
On the question of meeting Rosenstein, she replied: “There has not been a date yet, it may be this week, it may be necessary to make an appointment for another week in view of all the others in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'll always report the current information to the media."
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference with the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that too few press conferences had not led to a "diversity" of television reporters, even though she said, "I don't agree to the fact that they're going out."
Next, she suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press be increased.
"The President will arrange more meetings with questions and answers than any president before him," added without giving evidence. "We looked at this number."
The conference will continue to be held, said Sanders, but “if the representatives of the press were to ask the President of the United States directly, it would certainly be better than talking to me.
We'll try this and you'll see that we're doing it in the last few weeks and that the actual press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States."
The Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or attending open meetings or press conferences with visiting high-level representatives.
Self-evident press conferences are occasions.
This week in New York, the president likely showed why he was released and sometimes strangely before the rapporteurs.
Ministry of Health writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland not to be afraid of Brexit
The Ministry of Health wrote to EU employees working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and desire to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman's MP sent a letter six months before the departure of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to arrange costs on the application for the status of EU citizens working in the services provided.
Freeman, in his letter, wrote: “Over the summer the negotiations between Great Britain and the EU continue to decline and lead to the expected decision this year on the ground.
However, the British Government is also taking steps in preparation for a possible scenario to withdraw without agreement.
I know it must be a very comforting time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reassure you again how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of the staff, regardless of nationality.
Fellows from across the EU and yet do not provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are beneficial to the patients and communities to which we provide services.
Scotland is absolutely your home and our friendly wish is for you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is making an emergency surgical step after head injury
The withdrawal of Tigers from the state of Tennessee Christion Abercrombie brought about the emergency surgical phase after which he suffered head injury in Saturday season 31-27 from Vanderbilt Commodores, said Mike Organ from Tennessee.
The state's main trainer, Tennessee Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury came shortly before the time.
"He came to the post office and just broke up there," said Reed.
Trainers and doctors gave Abercrombie a cigarette in front of the glass glass and then placed it on the tray and prepared for further assessment.
A member of the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had surgery in Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are no "no details of the type/extreme of injury" yet and that the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, the second in the red triangle, has completed the first stage for the state of Tennessee after being transferred from Illinois.
Before the end of the game on Saturday, he had five complete steps, which means 18 steps in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher tax from property when buying property in Great Britain
Foreign buyers will take higher taxes on property when they buy property in Great Britain, while money will be used to help homeless people in the new Tory Plans
This action will neutralize the success of Corby's mind, whose aim is to attract young voters
An increase in the liability of higher property taxes will be paid to persons who do not pay taxes in Great Britain
The increase in state resources of £120 million per year – to help people without home
Buyers from abroad will pay higher taxes on the purchase of property when they buy property in Great Britain, while money will be used to help people without home, reports Theresa Mayow today.
This action will be launched as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbin's success in attracting young voters with a view to providing a more affordable accommodation and focusing on people with high incomes.
The increase in tax from the purchase of property will affect individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Great Britain, while money will strengthen the government's efforts to fight sleepless over their heads.
The premium, which is an addition to the current obligation to pay tax on the purchase of property, including higher levels imposed two years ago in other households and the purchase for the purpose of rent, may reach up to three per cent.
It is estimated that the state averages up to £120 million per year.
The estimates say that the newly built property in London buys 13 per cent of the citizens who are not residents of Great Britain, which avoids prices and makes it easier for those who buy first, to get on the roof of the house.
The number of wealthy areas of the country, especially in the main city, became “the cities of spirits” just because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new principles appeared only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the tax on property purchases to help younger people in their own home.
He accused large construction companies of holding property prices too high by taking the land, but not using it, and urged Mrs. Mayow to raise quotas from the prices available to make the "home" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of proposed housing reforms, including rent management and termination of “required” exits.
He also wants to increase the power of the committees to establish new houses.
Ms. Mayow said: “I told Loni that I wanted to make my efforts as a prime minister in the restoration of the British dream so that every new generation would have a better life.
And that means the repair of our damaged market with property.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life.
However, it cannot be justified to make it easy for non-members in Britain and foreign companies to buy houses as hard as British residents.
For many people, the dream of their own home is too far away and sleepless sleep is too real."
Jack Ross: "My highest ambition is to drive Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross states that his "highest ambition" is to be in a certain phase of management of Scotland.
The 42-year Scot is pleased with the challenge of the restoration of the North-East Club, which currently holds the third position in the First League, only three degrees below the top.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after bringing St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play behind my country as a player.
I got the B quality and it was," Ross said on BBC Scotland's Sports Sound channel.
“But I grew up following Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a child, and that is always something that will bring me back.
But this opportunity would only come if I were successful in running the club."
Ross' leaders in the role of manager Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former chief Alloa Athletic says he did not feel any discomfort from the consequences of such names in such a large club when he had previously rejected the prizes from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"The success of my time would be the question of whether I can return this club to Premier League.
Because of the structure and equipment in this club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get him back there, but I'd probably be successful only if I could get the club back there."
Ross's career in the course of the first three years, before acting as assistant chief in Dumarton and 15 months spent as a trainer between Hearts.
Then he helped Alla's club to compete with the third group and transformed St. Mirren from the beginning of the event to the victory of the master's title immediately in the next season.
And Ross says he's got a lot better feeling now than he ever had in his career players in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"These were probably real cruisers," recalls the time when Alla was arrested.
"I really believed that driving is more right for me than playing.
It sounds weird because I was good, I was good at building and using suitable heights.
But playing can be boring.
There's a lot of things you have to spend a week with.
I'm always going through the stress and pressure of the job, but I just have a good feeling about driving.
I always wanted to be a manager, and now I do, I feel that in my entire adult life, I feel the most in my skin."
You can hear the entire conversation in the Sports Sound series on Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland channel from 12:00 to 13:00 BST
The study found that great time at the point is on Saturday at 17:30 p.m.
The annual wave of leadership increased the arrival of British households with difficulties, but increased pressure on the restaurant network.
The figures show that households and bars reported a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in July – but the restaurant income decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from CGA consultants who produced final reports, stated: “The stable sunlight and more than the expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that the red followed a similar pattern as the previous red when it increased to 2.8 percent, but the restaurant was even more crowded.
The decline in restaurant prices by 1.8 per cent in June has still increased in June.
Guests and bars who were drinking have already been led to the most violent of the same kind as the restaurants have been ruined.
Gentlemen whose main markets are from food, the sun has also endured, although not as dramatic as the restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Among the measured values and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while the sale of food by three per cent declined."
Paul Newman, from an analytical company of leisure activities and hospitality, noted: “These results are a further trend that lasts from the depths.
The timing and impact of significant social or sport activities are the biggest factors in the area of sales outside the domestic market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to fight, that the annual decline in sales of 4.8 per cent will be particularly painful in light of current pressures on costs.
The long summer of summer cannot be the worse time for operators of food-sustaining companies and the time to tell whether the calmer temperatures that we have experienced in August will bring so much relief."
The total increase in sales in the economy and restaurants, including new open ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a decrease in the presentation of the sign.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitor for the British domestic, bar and restaurant industry collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds, which is a industry measure in the sector.
Every fifth child has a secret account on social networks that are hidden before parents.
Every fifth child, only 11 years of age, has a secret account in social networks that conceals before parents and pedagogy, shows research
A study of 20,000 high school dropouts showed an increase in “false instagram sites”
The reports raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of complaints indicated that they have a "main" account they know about
Every fifth child, only 11 years of age, creates accounts in social networks that are hidden before their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school dropouts showed a rapid increase in “false instagram accounts” on which photographs are shared.
The reports show concern that it comes to the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the complaints indicated that they have an encumbered "main" account that parents know about and, at the same time, have a private account.
One mother, who posted her 13-year-old daughter's secret Web site, found that her puberty nurse was trying to "strengthen her."
A study carried out by the Digital Awarness UK and the Association Headmasters and Headness Conference (HMC) independent schools showed that 40 percent of students between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, with half of which they agree to manage their own accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: “It is disturbing that there are so many teenagers trying to create online spaces where their parents and pedagogists cannot find them."
Elidh Doyle will be "a voice of athletes" in the Scottish athletic committee
Eliidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as an ineffective director at the annual general meeting of the Steering Committee.
Doyle is the most prized light athlete and President Ian Beattie described the transfer as a great opportunity for those who are in charge of sport as those who will benefit from its long-term experience at international level in the past decade.
"Eilid has a wide respect for the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that it will be very beneficial for the Scottish athletes when they become a member of the committee," said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am excited that I will be the voice of athletes, and I hope that I will be truly successful and that I will help carry sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 and 400 meters in 1996 at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, won a total of four gold medals and is now a regular BBC expert, was unable to go after a transit ice attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had an attack.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said it's only time to show me if I'm going to get better or something.
It's overwhelming, but I've been able to get a full recovery, I've learned to walk again, and I'm having fun today!
Thank you for all the exciting news!"
Milk extracting apprising matik comparison to cows sharing views online
The producer-in-the-art company has distributed online advertising advertising that compares the mother’s breast to the coming cows.
In the context of the introduction to the market of "the first silent portable trailers on the world", Envi published a music video with a nickname showing the freedom that the new trailer gives to mother-in-laws.
Four real mothers dance in a chair full of chairs on a piece of text: "Yes, I do, but you don't see any eyes" and "If you didn't realize I didn't have time, my breasts are here."
The congregation continues: “Pup, pump, I feed children, pump, pump, I burn my sweet milk.”
Advertisement published on the company Facebook page, however, has created an online controversial reaction.
The video had 77,000 follow-ups and hundreds of comments, and it received mixed reactions from those who saw it, while many of them indicated that it was a light on the "hours" of the milk industry.
"The very poor decision to abuse the goods on advertising on this product.
Like we must be pregnant and born to be able to milk, but their children are taken a few days after birth," says one of the commentators.
Elvie is discrepancies on the leg (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It’s understandable that it’s traumatic for the mother and the child.
But, yes, why don't you use it for a press pump for mothers who leave their children behind?"
Someone else added: "This advertising is completely out of hand."
There was also the silence of the one who defended the advertising, since one woman admitted that the fund was considered to be “responsible. ”
"I think it's a genius idea.
I'd fix this pump if I was still driving.
I feel exactly like a cow when I'm resting.
The announcement is a little crazy, but it's all right.
It's a genius product," one user wrote.
Another adds: “It’s an amusing advertising focused on mothers who treat milk (often at work or on toilets) and feel like ‘ cows. ’
It's not a commercial to honor or destroy the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that they are all dancing with discrepancies hidden under the cover.
The concept of the campaign is based on the assumption that many women who take milk claim to feel like cows.
However, Elvie is simply quiet, she has no door, no hats, and she is beautifully hidden in the undergarments on her legs, so she gives the woman freedom of movement, the opportunity to hold the child and even when she refuses to walk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD for mothers, added: “Elvie's abortion is so revolutionary that it deserves an express and attractive introduction to the market.
By creating parallels between mother and stepmothers, we wanted to show that milk is taken away and all the challenges associated with it and to show the fun and incredible feeling of freedom that the new nurse will ensure.
It's not the first time Elvie's rehearsal got out.
During the week of London, one of the two mothers of the designer Marta Jakubowski, who was using the product, appeared in prayer.
The hundreds of children of migrants moved quietly to the state camp at the Texas border
The number of children detained by migrants has increased despite the fact that the monthly crossings remained relatively unchanged, especially because the strong rhetoric and principles imposed by the Trumpa administration have reduced the placement of children with disabilities.
Most suppliers were traditionally created immigrants without evidence who were afraid of the threat of staying in the country, so they claimed that they belonged to the child.
The risk grew in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households must provide fingerprints and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who had asked for the status of the individual injured.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested have no previous criminal records.
Up to 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or members of sponsors are illegal in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue in their footsteps," said Mr. Albence.
According to the staff of the asylum facility, the representatives of the children who are in an attempt to address the concerns of the children have introduced new rules that will require some of them to be brought before the trial month before detention, instead of the previous 60 days of standard.
The meeting shall be made public by means of a call within the videoconferencing, rather than personally, in order to declare its case as a legal status for an immigrant judge.
Those who do not have the right to help, according to the study, will be deported quickly.
The longer the child is in custody, the more likely the pressure or depression is to occur, which may lead to seizures or attempts to escape, the employees of the asylum facility will claim and submit reports from the system within the last few months.
Lawyers claim that these concerns have been raised in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where there are signs that the child is looking, with greater likelihood of being ignored, just because of the size of the device.
They added that the transfer of children to a camp without the time of the committed emotional training or the release of friends could lead to the trauma that many children are already fighting.
Syria announced that the US, French and Turkish "opportunity" must be withdrawn immediately
During the general meeting of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualam also called after the return of Syrian refugees to their homes, although there is already eight years of war in the country.
Moala, also a prime minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian territory were illegal, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that “it will be carried out accordingly.”
"It must be issued immediately and unconditionally," he said at the meeting.
Moualem insisted that “the anti-terrorism wave in Syria is almost over, ” with more than 360 000 people and millions of others coming to their homes since 2011.
He said that Damascus will continue in "war in this sacred battle until we rescue all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign people."
The United States has some 2,000 units in Syria, which are mainly trained by Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces to fight with President Bashar al-Assad and advise them.
France has more than 1,000 units in the field of war.
In the release of the Mouals, he declared that they had good conditions of return for them and charged “some Western countries” with“ the spread of non-racial concerns”, which caused the refugees to refuse to return.
"We have praised the international community and humanitarian organization for facilitating these returns," he said.
"They policy what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be available for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and opposition to the end of the war.
The diplomats of the United Nations state that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the installation of a protective belt in the latest Idlib attack has created an opportunity to engage in political discussions further.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented the massive invasion of the Syrian forces protected by Russia in the province of which three million people live.
However, Moual showed that the agreement has "explained deadlines" and expressed the hope that the military withdrawal will be directed to the Jedi, including fighters from the Nusra Front organization, who will "will be defeated."
The representative of the United Nations Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon the first meeting of the new committee, consisting of members of the government and opposition, will be held to propose a voluntary constitution for Syria and to postpone the elections.
Mouale has provided conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee with the words that the work of the panel should be limited to “the control of the existing constitutions” and issued a warning before delay.
Why Trump wins in the second period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would also win in other elections in 2020 if the most reliable number of liberal observers, complaints and scandals had not yet completed his office as president.
In such a case, it would certainly be “the most dramatic finals of the presidential period in history ”!
So far, there are no signs of the following benefits.
Since 2014, monitoring in the main transmission time has doubled to 1,05 million to CNN and almost to 1.6 million to MSNBC.
Fox News has an average follow-up of 2.4 million in the main broadcast time, which is an increase of 1.7 million years ago by the Nielsen Agency and the “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC has increased monitoring on cable television on 3.5 million of the following main night messages.
"It's a fire that people love because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the director of the series "Designed Survivor" to the ABC drama about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy author and series "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
It is mentioned on the train in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd love Trump.
Why did she ask?
"He said, 'Because he's playing with him,' Mrs. Scovell said to me.
It's a lot of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story that is playing in of Washington could affect the future of Roe in. Wada, however, the families of immigrants can be reunited and in the benefit of the global economy.
The discharge is a luxury that can only allow you the most privileged to follow.
And yet it is about whether you're informed if you're a citizen when you're following a panel of experts who discuss how Bob Woodward uses "deep ground" resources for his book "Fear," the leather band of Paula Manaforta is worth $15,000 ("adjustment" as Washington Post) and the consequences of the unwanted "anatomy" by Mr. Trump Stormy Daniels.
I'm not going to look at Super Maria in the same way.
"Part of what he does and what causes the sense of reality show is that you are fed every night," said Brent Montgomery, director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the Pawn Stars document on the rolling c.F.L. Trumpov series, which assesses Kim Čong-una).
You can't let go of any episode, or you'll be back.
When I joined Mr. Fleissem this week, it was Sunday, outside the northern coast of Kauai 80 degrees, but he was busy inside and watched MSNBC and played CNN.
He couldn't get rid of himself unless Brett Kavanaugh set up the Senate Court and the future of the Supreme Court was on the shoulders.
"I remember when we made all these crazy orders and people said, "It's the beginning of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I think it was supposed to be funny, but it showed that they had the truth."

Money goes out to the most happy domestic competitions in the Middle Ages
It is not surprising that after the 17th cycle of Pennsylvania, after the financial crisis, the reorganization of the congresses, which have generated two officers of the Office in the fight against the same cross.
This has recently led to the formation of the Pittsburg District by the former Democratic Republican Conor Lamb – which has received another round in the special election of the Loni to the fire.
The Lamb stands against the other holder of the office, the Republican Keithu Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th century Pennsylvania, which is heavily covered with the new 17.
After the Supreme Pension Court issued in January its opinion that the old ranks were not constitutionally divided into the interests of the Republicans, the map was re-examined.
In the new 17th round, the initiative launched a preliminary financial dispute between the main financial parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after the close victory in the followed March special elections to the 18th Congress.
For more than ten years, this cross was incorporated into the Republican and Donald Trump won 20 points in the circle.
Political experts give Democrats a peaceful leap.
America is considering visiting Salvador for China's support, and is following up.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under peaceful pressure in Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with President Panamy Juane Carlos Varela in June 2017 and was accommodated in a hotel in Panama until partners visited the organizational team of Trump's leadership.
The representatives of the foreign ministries decided to withdraw the American diplomatic mission from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the recent decisions not to know Thaj-wan," said the speaking ministry of Heather Nauertva in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
But the trials were directed only against Salvador, which received an estimate of $140 million of US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed tests, which included a reduction in financial assistance and focus on the restriction of visas, would be for the Central American country and its high unemployment and the number of deaths of the disease.
With continued internal meetings, representatives of the North American and Central America held a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity related to similar negotiations from the previous year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But in half of the session, the former management representatives explained that they wanted to continue in meetings and to effectively complete any of the trials considered for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now entrusted with the solution of the conference currently planned for half of October, in the framework of a signal that the board administration has introduced diplomats.
And three U.S. envoys returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without having any new news from Washington.
In the White House, Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate, which described three American representatives, including two diplomats who agreed with discussions on internal negotiations on the conditions of anonymity.
Their sources were confirmed by external analytics, who are close to government executives and also spoke under anonymity.
Study history
The report by Robert Mueller from the Special Committee on the possible defence of Mr Trump in the exercise of the law he is now in the public records of many evidence.
In his investigation, Mr. Mueller was apparently referring to whether Mr. Trump's campaign did not contain a secret agreement with Russia regarding an attack on our elections.
If there were a party to the Congress, Mr. Trump would have to report before that body, as he was preparing to represent again before the voter, and in the end, he would have waited carefully for the jury composed of his colleagues.
This is a whole range of "if" and I do not want to say that Mr. Trumpa's flag is inevitable – just as in similar policies in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic before him has a choice that affects how long suffering will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to set up an attack on Hitler, only to establish and support his western forces in Munich, Czechoslovakia.
We sold and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years of bloody bloodshed that followed.
History is all around such critical moments that speed up or slow down the path of democracy.
The Americans are now facing a few similar critical moments.
What are we gonna do if Mr. Trump comes out of the office of General Prosecutor Roda Rosenstein, here the man who is conducting the investigation of Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein had been excited about this since the report announced that Loni had secretly proposed to record the president and had been speculating that he was not healthy enough to stop the presidential office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the versions of The Times are inexhaustible.
“How do we react if the newly requested investigation by F.B.I. Bretta Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or what if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of a convincing charge of sexual assault and cruel charges?
And what is most important is that we will vote in half of the working period to Congress, which will assume Mr. Trump's responsibility?
If we pass these tests, democracy will wait a long dark night.
But I believe we don't travel, and that's the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Sloven Jew who deported to Auschwitz the same Nazi regime that once occupied my capital home.
She survived, had immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me on the Sabbath to burn candles on the table with a swastika.
How could I be optimistic about our future with such a legacy?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic about dealing with Rapid Video
Rangers on Thursday's Rapid View with the knowledge that the victory over the Rakushani would give them, after a decisive restraint in Spain, to the Villarreal farm earlier this month, a great hope for the process of the Group G of the European League.
The damage of the knee prevented Agent Graham Dorrans from appearing on the floor for the first time in the season until 2-2 with Villarreel. She believes that Rangers can use this result as an impact bridge to larger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a quality team," said a 31-year-old player.
“We went to the game with faith that we could draw something, and we took the point.
Maybe we could finally multiply it yet, but the remiza was probably just.
They were probably better at first, but in that second, we improved and we were better.
It'll be a big European night next Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it'll be hard because in the last game, we've got good results.
The London year was hard enough, with all my injuries and changes in the club, but now I feel very good about it.
The team is strong and the guys really enjoy it, the coach is fine too.
I hope we'll get to it now, we'll have the last season in the head, and we'll be successful."
Women are worried about retirement support.
Although the participants had a clear idea of how to care for them, few people spoke to family members about it.
Half of the people in the national study reported that they had spent the price of long-term care with their partner.
Just 10 percent said she talked to her children about it.
"People want to take care of them as a family member, but they don't agree with it," explains Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Life Insurance.
You can start this way.
Talk to your partner and children: You cannot prepare a family for the care provided if you do not announce your request before.
Together with your counsel and family, find out where and how to take care, because these factors can play a big role in determining the price.
Ask your financial adviser: The advisor can help you find a way to pay these expenses.
For example, financing long-term care can be used by means of traditional care insurance, hybrid care insurance, which will help you pay these expenses, or by using your own insurance using your own resources – until you have money.
Create your legal documents: Stop the legal battle until it goes.
Appoint a nurse representative, which will be a reliable person who will monitor your medical care and ensure that doctors will comply with your wishes if you are not able to communicate on your own.
Also consider saving full power for your finances.
Choose a reliable person who will make a financial decision for you and ensure that your accounts are broken if you are not able to do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs medical care and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medicine and allergy?
Write these details to the written plan so that you can be prepared.
"In the game are not only financial, but for example, what are the names of healers?" asks Martin.
“Where are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have the mentioned plan prepared by hand."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died during a violent earthquake and tsunami that invaded the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. According to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to grow.
Since communication is out of operation, the auxiliary units were unable to obtain any information from the Dondrea Regent, which is the area north of Palu, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter of 7.5 degrees power.
After the disaster broke out, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are a number of key facts about the city of Palu and the kingdom of Dondria, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Province of Central Sulawesi, which is located at the end of the railways on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi and its population was estimated to be 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunamis struck.
Dondrea is a region that extends more than 300 km (180 km) along the coast to the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, the administrative region under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main components of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province are fishing and farming, especially in the Dodrea coastal region.
In the province, there is also a significant difficulty in nikulu, which is concentrated mainly in Moroval on the coast of the island of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian organisation Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donghiu have been active in tsunamis for the past 100 years.
In 1938 she killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Tsunami hit the west of Dongry in 1996 when she asked for nine victims.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Coast of Ohni, and it is here regularly to land.
Here's a list of some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: The great earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries and prepared 226 000 people across the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in the province of Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Suma by the end of March and at the beginning of the autumn.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, near the coast of Suma.
2006: The earthquake of 6.8 magnitude hit them on the most beautiful Indonesian island of Java and caused tsunamis that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
There's more than 1100 people on life.
2010: A 7.5 earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawa, near Sumatri and caused tsunamis of 10 metres high, destroying dozens of villages and preparing for the lives of about 300 people.
2016: The mild earthquake struck the region of Pidie Jaya in the province of Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the devastating effects of the death earthquake and tsunamis since 2004.
This time she didn't make any tobacco, but more than 100 died from falling buildings.
2018: A strong earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, where more than 500 people were killed, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin was arrested for being charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Albanian governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for charges of assault.
According to a report issued on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers agency, 29-year-old Palin living in Vasilla in Aljašce was arrested for suspecting domestic violence, infringement of domestic violence and detention.
When, according to the police report, his wife's knowledge tried to call the police to report certain crimes, Palin got her a phone call.
Palin was sent to the Mat-Su Pretreal Facility facility and is held on an unencumbered bond of USD 500, the KTUU reports.
According to the network’s report, he appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared that he felt “expectedly innocent” when he was asked for an explanation.
Palin is headed by three classes A, which means that it could be sentenced to a year of deprivation of liberty and to a return of up to $250,000.
He was also accused of class B infringement, which was punishable by one-day imprisonment and the amount of $2000.
It's not the first thing Palin has to face with a criminal notice.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palina.
His mother, Sarah Palin's mother, reported the police's official attack on the police.
The case is currently before the Algerian court for war veterans.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, abuse of domestic violence and armed robbery in connection with the incident.
He must have hit his girlfriend's face.
Sarah Palinova was criticized in 2016 by a group of war veterans when her son’s violent behavior was linked to posttraumatic stress disorder caused by the child’s service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunamis: percentages of the dead
At least 384 people died after arriving on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication networks are out of operation, and in the coming days the victims are expected to stop.
The earthquake struck directly on the shore of the island of Sulawesi, which lies north of the Indonesian capital Jakarty.
On social media, videos depicting the horrors.
The crowds gathered at the beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal applicants require an exceptional death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in NYC
The federal prosecutors in New York ask for the death penalty for Sayfulla Saipov, who is suspected of surviving a terrorist attack in New York where eight people have died, namely an exceptional punishment that has not been committed for federal crimes in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly carried out an attack on the cycle section of the West Side Highway in the fourth Lower Manhattan with the help of the owner of the Home Depot, who created the walker and cyclers.
In order to condemn the death penalty, the complainants will have to prove that Saipov killed eight victims “soundly” and “soundly” caused a number of injuries – thus defining the conditions for the death penalty in accordance with a document approved by the Southern District of New York.
According to the court documents, both figures would mean the possibility of a death penalty.
Several weeks after the attack, the Federal High Court accused Saipov of 22 criminal acts, among which there was, for example, a murder in the interests of justice, used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The auction demanded "significant planning and preparation", the complainants claim and describe the way Saip's action was carried out as a threat, cruel and returned."
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, pain and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Clevese, Ann-Laure Decadadve, Darrena Drake, Ariel Erlijve, Hernana Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucca,” he says.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York court passed the death penalty.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but he was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
Finally, the death penalty was actually carried out in connection with a federal case in New York in 1953, when a couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were repaired, which was shown to be held for the purpose of spying for the Soviet Union during the two years before the war.
Both Rosenberg sat on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, appeared in court documents during the days and months following the attack of a minimal pity.
The police said he felt good about what he did.
According to Saip's claim, he was inspired to watch the video of the Islamic state on the phone to escape the attack.
The police also announced that he also requested an extension of the train to the Islamic state in the hospital room.
He said he was innocent of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public prosecutors representing Saipov, said that they are clearly "lost" by the decision of the complainants.
"We believe that the decision to require the death penalty instead of the acceptance of guilt and the assessment of life without the possibility of being released will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone concerned," Patton said.
The Saipov's prosecutors had already asked the complainant not to demand the death penalty.
According to the Conservative Party, it should be entrusted with meetings on Brexit NIGEL FARGE
During today's protest at the Conservative Party's Conference, Nigel Farage committed to mobilize the people's army.
The former Leader of the Independent Party of the United Kingdom stated that politics must, as proposed by one of his own Members Theresy Mayo, feel pressure on the European Union.
The Red Conservative Ambassador Peter Bone announced on his way to Birmingham that Great Britain would be out now if he was a secretary for Brexit Mr Farage.
But the problem faced by Ms. Mayo when she was at peace with her ranks, where she had a deep resentment, was still raised by conservatives fighting for asylum in the EU, who joined in a self-sustained protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain its compromise plan from the Czechs under attack by the people of Brexit, the residents of the Union and the EU itself.
The partners insist that they will continue to try to agree with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and will force Eurosceptics and Laborists to choose between their package and ‘chaosem’.
Mr. Bonne said that the Leave Means Leave group was gathering in Solihul, where he wanted to appear at the Chequers.
Mr Farage proposed that he should become a representative and be responsible for communicating with Brussels.
"If he were in the head, we would be out today," he declared.
Ambassador Wellingborough added: , I'm going to set up for Brexit, but we have to go to the Chequers."
To show his opposition to the EU, he said, "We have not fought world wars to listen.
In our own country we want to make our own laws."
Mr Bone rejected the proposal that the public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: , "The idea that the British citizens would change their views and want to maintain is simply necessary."
Conservatory of Brexit Andrea Jenkys, who also participated in the event, sent reporters: ,I'm just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
,Checkers is not popular in the general public, opposition will not vote for him and he does not like our members or our activists who are currently filling the streets to be elected at all.
Forget about the Chequers and start listening."
In a sharp message to Mrs Mayow, she says, "Minister presidents will keep their place when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said that conservative policies had to be reached in an unacceptable situation if they wanted to reverse their decisions adopted on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us people and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that we don't approve of you."
In the above report, he added: ,I want our political class, which is on Brexit's horizon, to feel pressure.
"We now mobilize the army of the people of this country, which has given us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become independent and proud of Great Britain, who is ruling alone."
The residents of the Union, inter alia, went to Birmingham and then arranged for a two-year meeting in the city centre.
Several activists had transparency Conservatives against Brexit after the weekend started functioning this page.
The Labour Ambassador Lord Adonis spoke to the conservators about problems with the security of the application of the party after the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who, according to their own words, can provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
- It's all a mess.
There is nothing like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren's plan is to make a proper proposal for a president's candidate.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren announced that after November's elections, he would "proceeded a candidate to the president".
Boston Globe reports that a democracy from Massachusetts spoke about its future on Saturday at the Western Massachusetts workshop.
Warrenov, a prominent critic of President Donald Trumpa, is trying to renew November against the Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired by the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It seemed in the center of speculation that it could be set up in 2020.
The Sunday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the volunteers at the workshop from the moment Trump sat in the office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to speak to the president's office.
Warren replied that it was time for women to get out of Washington and make our government broken, which means a woman at the highest point."
He was suspected of shooting Simse from LSU.
The police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that she had a suspect from the five-year-old basketball player's LSU Wayda Simse.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the 20-year-old Dayteona Simpson arrest at 11:00 Conference ET news.
A video was released from the flag shot asking for the identification of the man caught on the recorder.

Russia's high price: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of the world's master when his team regime won the victory over Sebastian Vettel
Right now, when Valtteri Bottas finished the Saturday qualification before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the Mercedes team regime will play a great role in the race.
From the field position, Bottas had a good start and almost stopped Hamilton when in the first two attacks he defended his position and called Vettela to attack the teammate.
The leader took off the roof as the first and let Hamilton drive the truck across the corner of the group, which should be decisive.
J. Mercedes went to the deck on the bike later and arranged for Vettel after departure. However, Hamilton broke his neck and, in a quiet file, had to leave Ferrari unattended in order to defend himself in the third attack after the second manoeuvre.
Max Verstappen came out of the back row of the train, and at the end of the first car he was born on his 21st birthday.
Then he led a lot of the race because he kept the original pneumatics as far as possible to focus on the fast finish and could get Kimim Raikkonen's fourth position.
Finally, he got to the bottom of the 44th wheel, but in the remaining eight wheels he could no longer raise speed, and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri took a whole weekend of great work, and when he got an order, he was acting like a perfect gentleman.
This led to fantastic work and rewards are the first two places," Hamilton declared.
It was a really bad thing about the body.
President Donald Trump, Senator Dianne Feinstein, was laughing at the Saturday meeting because she was unable to publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accused of being a candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh with sexual assault.
During the meeting in West Virginia, he did not directly mention the statement made by Ford before the Senate Court Commission, rather than stating that what is happening in Senate shows that people are “bad and hostile and spreading.”
"One thing that could happen, and a wonderful thing that happens in the last days in Senara, when you see the relationship when you see those people, how they are angry and cruel and rebellious and profaning," he said.
"When you look at publishing and publishing and they will tell you, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, can you stand for this boy?
Remember her answer... you published the document - ,ach, oh, what?
Oh, no.
She didn't say anything."
Well, wait a minute.
We made it... no, it's not," he added and liked the senator.
Feinstein sent Ford’s letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh in July and information only at the beginning of September – but Feinstein denied that it would come out of her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's address, nor did I publish the case," said Cloomi Feinstein, as reported by The Hill.
"She asked me to keep everything secret and I did exactly what she asked me to do."
According to all of her words, the chairman, who expressed his concern at the meeting on Saturday evening, said: “I tell you, this is a serious matter of the body.
Maybe she didn't, but anyway it's the worst body word I've ever seen."
The President continued in the defence of the candidate to the Supreme Court, which three women accused of sexual harassment, and pointed out that the Democrats used these charges for their own purposes.
"It is a decision to take too much back any resources available.
You can see this sub-division, this security, is one of them who hurts who has to go back to the country to get back to power and to cormidil," quoted the Mediaite president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer twice treated Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made a five-way battle in the Elitné League against Belfast Giants won in the Sunday course in Dundee, which ended 5-3.
The giants soon gained double-ranking leadership thanks to the principles of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie managed to fix the house before Dwyer returned Giant's leadership.
Francois Bouchard then compared to Dundee again, two banks of Lukase Lundvald Nielsna gave their victory.
It was a third strike in the Elitní lie in the season for the Adam Keefee team, which took place on Friday in Belfast Dundee to defeat 2-1.
Both teams met in the season, and all three of the previous games were dominated by Giants.
Two of the first branches came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, to help Kendall McFaulla, while David Rutherford joined the assistant at Beauvillier's second floor four minutes later.
The first third was wild when Sullivan got home back to the game at 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt prepared a head for Cownie who compared at 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, Ginants went to the cabin for the first stop, but only when he marked his second head at the end of the first third.
The housekeepers dug up and Bouchard was again able to fix the cave from the violence game at 27:37.
Cownie's and Charles Corcorana later helped Nielsen's second third in the game to recapture the lead on Dundee, and that player assured his team's lead in half the final third.
Giants, who have now lost the fourth of the last five games, will play another game on Friday at Milton Keynes.
The air traffic leader died to enable hundreds of people to avoid land degradation on board the aircraft
The leading flight in Indonesia is celebrated as a castle after what he lost when he saw hundreds of passengers flying safely to the deck.
More than 800 people were missing and many were missing after the great earthquake that caused tsunamis on the fifth island of Sulawesi.
Strong subsequent floods swept the region and many people remained trapped in the coastal cities of Palu.
But despite the fact that his forty-one-year-old colleague Anthony Gunawan Agong fled to save his life, he refused to leave his place in a divorcée with the rebel commanders at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pala.
He remained in his position to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the stage, could be safely recovered.
Then he jumped off the ledge down when he thought he was going to sit down.
He died later in the hospital.
The air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, announced to the TV channel Australia ABC News that the decision helped to save hundreds of lives.
We prepared to transport a wheelchair from Balikpapaun to Kalimantan, which was transferred to a hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before he reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken by this message," he added.
In the meantime, the responsible authorities expressed concern that the number of deaths could reach thousands. The agency responsible for disaster resolution indicated that access to the cities of Dodrea, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The number of deaths continues to rise because many bodies remain unrestrained under the neck and many of them have not been rescued," said the language agency Sutopo Purwo Nugro.
The waves in the 19th floor of Palu reached a height of up to six meters, and the city will end the mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft are bringing assistance and supplies to the affected places.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said to Sky News station: “Every minute the ambulance will bring another body.
There's not enough drinking water here.
Small shops are stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, leading the international Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN station: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to survive, but we don’t know what they will find on the spot.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo came to Palu on Sunday and told military commanders: “I ask you to work day and night and to complete all the tasks necessary for evacuation.
You're ready?" said CNN.
This year Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombo, where more than 550 people were killed.
Aeroplanes in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that after a plane crash in a legend one person is missing
The flying company, who had been warning in a legend on one of the micron islands in the Pacific, now indicated that one person was wrong, and at the beginning said that all passengers and crew counting 47 safely evacuated from the floating plane.
Air Niugini indicated in the press report that on Saturday afternoon it was not possible to find a traveling man.
The airline has indicated that it cooperates with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in the search for a lost husband.
The airlines did not immediately respond to the requirements for providing details about this traveler, his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crews after the aircraft got into the water when they tried to land on the island of Chuuk.
The officials said on Friday that there were seven persons being transferred to the hospital.
The airlines indicated that six passengers remained in the hospital and on Saturday and all were in a stabilized condition.
However, what caused the danger and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The U.S. airline and maritime authorities indicated that the aircraft had arrived in the airport before the arrival of the train.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the road.
American passenger Bill Jaynes reported that the plane had reached very small altitudes.
"It was very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes further indicated that he, together with the others, managed to get water from the sand deep to the emergency exits of the floating plane.
He went on to say that the fireman panicked and screamed and that he himself suffered a mild wound on his head.
The U.S. Navy indicated that seafarers who worked close to the coastal molluscs helped save the crew carrying passengers on the shores before the plane dropped to a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from Aviation Safety Network indicate that in the last two decades, aircraft with a registration mark of PNG were killed by 111 people, but there was no threat to Air Niguni.
Analytics describe the last moments of a woman burned alive
On Saturday, the complaint ended in this case where the husband was again opposed to the fire of a woman living in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Ministry of Justice in his analysis witnessed several hours and provided expert research in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury's analysis of how he used the records from the phone of the 29 defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19th-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett indicated that he had received the location data from several mobile phones that proved that Tellis was dead on the night of her death in Chambers' company, which was in conflict with his previous report, listed The Clarion Ledger.
On the basis of his cell phone data, he was shown that he spent the night with Chambers, admitted he was with his friend Michael Sanford, and then visited the police.
Sanford stood before the court and testified that the day he was not in town.
When the appellants questioned whether Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said, "he's lying because my car was in Nashville that night."
The other thing was that Tellis suggested that he knew Chambers about two weeks after her death.
However, the phone records indicate that these two knew only one week.
Rowlett pointed out that shortly after the death of Chambers Tellis, he was able to retrieve Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He took her all his life," said Hale.
The funeral will begin its final talk on Sunday.
The judge stated that he was expecting the case to be delivered before the jury the same day later.
High Breed: What is a wise hip hop?
The hip hop trio wants to deal with negative views on this genre by filling his song with positive references.
Capela High Breed from Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from its beginnings with political relations and solutions to social problems.
So they want to go back to the roots and repopulate the scientific hip hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have met in recent times with the restoration of artists such as Akal and Lowkey in Great Britain.
Another black man?!
The NY returning officer complains a couple of times after the "ristic" text message
The director of New York laments a few of his discriminatory remarks after having received a misannounced text message from his mother, in which he was marked as a "other black" text message.
A few denied that they were racists and compared the complaint to "drinking".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her shock when she found out the first day at work in 2016 that her new teacher, Giselle Maurice, was a black man.
"NIEEÉÉÉÉ, DELÍ ČERNOŠKA," wrote P. P. Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to his wife.
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent her a p.M. Maurice twice.
When she understood her faux pass, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman came out of Mrs. Maurice and pointed out that she was working really badly and that she was looking forward to the Philippines, in her New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one job and Uber was sent home.
Maurice now complains about compensation for removal from work and seeks compensation for $350 per day of the six-month commitment for which she was hired at the beginning of the contract, even if she has not concluded the contract.
"I want to show them that this isn't going to happen," said the Post this Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
However, the two of them expressed concern that they were not racist, but that the termination of Mrs Maurice's employment was an appropriate measure because they feared that they would no longer be able to believe her after that attack.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
It's definitely not racist.
We are no racist," said her husband, Joel Plasco's Post list.
"But would you believe your child in someone to whom you held back, even though it was a mistake?
Your newborn child?
But come on."
Plasco compared the application to "difficulty" and pointed out that his wife was only two months pregnant with an older child and was in a very difficult situation.
"Would you drive for someone like this?
That's not a nice thing," the investment banker said.
Even though the trial continues, the judge on social media quickly condemned the two for their conduct and logic.
Historians of the stories about the bear Paddington feared that readers were indifferent to the speaking bear show the latest reports
“ It’s hard to get into the situation of someone who first reads it, ” said Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted.
It's very fun to know this, but now that we know the huge success of the Paddington bear."
She noted that her father, who worked as a cameraman for BBC before he was inspired to write a book on a small lung nurse, was very disappointed that his work had been rejected, added on the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book, which became a “sympathetic” point after his death last year.
Paddington, described as “a very important member of her family”, added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a very quiet man, he was never quite exclusive," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like you should have a child who got something that you could really be proud of.
I think Paddington's success was looking for this view.
Even though it was his only creation and imagination, he always tried to record all the successes of just Paddington."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye on the phone
Her daughter was rushed to Louise Pasteura 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"He called me regularly to tell me that it was really bad and that he does not expect it to happen," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I had a phone call from Nada, where she told me she was going to die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be there with you soon.
I'll be there with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart in motion gradually lost her effectiveness and left her body.
She died a short time later and it was like it was all over.
I just had to sit and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it in my head."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving losing her daughter, got into the plane together with other passengers, without giving a hint as to how difficult the trial is right.
"No one knew about it," she said.
"I kept my head covered, I walked all the time through my cheeks.
It's hard to explain, but it was just during the summer when I felt a tremendous understanding to Nado.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how powerful he loved her."
Screaming women send surveillance to prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide cooperate to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are spreading views of the Welsh bridge with inspirational links and telephone numbers on which people can seek support.
Ms. Tyler's son was only 13 years old when he suffered from depression and, as a result, he was 18 years old.
"I wouldn't want any other parent to feel what I felt every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said her son was given a young cook with a loud smile.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile could light up any room."
Still, before his death, he left his job because he was “in a really dark place. ”
In 2014 Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found an immortal body of his cousin after he took his life.
Ms. Davis says, "I'm still afraid of what will affect his life."
Ms. Davis suggested: “To let people know that they have people who are willing to help them and can talk to them, even if they are talking about their friends.
Don't sit still, you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who was the flight friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, who had been her partner for 15 years, and that was shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he felt on the floor, or depressed, at all, nothing," he explains.
“Several days before Christmas, we then observed the change in his behavior.
It was the worst day of all – when the children opened their gifts, and they didn’t even look at them, nothing.”
She pointed out that her partner’s death was a tremendous tragedy for them, but she had to do so gradually: “This can be done in the family.
It broke up with us.
But we all have to go on and fight."

The future of Bretta Kavanaugh depends on how the FBI starts its investigation
"I thought we could get something that he actually asked – an investigation at a time of limitation, with a limited scope – we could put a little unit into it," said Mr. Flake on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would "disappear" because both sides would be buried after the partitionion in future positions.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to start an investigation?
Their resistance is well timed.
The elections in half of the electoral period are only five weeks away from us on 6 November, and if the Republicans are expected to do wrong, this will lead to their fundamental failure in attempting to prosecute the man they are required to serve in the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush called the senators, stealing from them, supported by Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for President Bush and met with his wife Ashley, who was then Bush's personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI collects its message?
The Senate will vote on this and there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in Senate, which has enabled Vice-President Mika Pence to pass the sentence and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
Number of refugees from North Korea for Kima "missed"
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has declined since the beginning of the Kim Čong-Una government seven years ago, says a South Korean lawyer.
Byeong-seug Park, quoting data from the South Korean Ministry for Association, stated that 1127 flights have occurred in the last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr Park further indicated that there are stricter controls on the border between North Korea and China and the higher rates of passengers required on the border.
Phyjongjang has not issued any public statements.
A large majority of the refugees from the North today receive an offer to the South Korean population.
Since the end of the Korean war in 1953, Saul claims that 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border.
Most of them are affected by China, which has the highest border in North Korea and is more likely to cross it than in a heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two of Korea.
The Chinese is viewed as illegal migrants, not as refugees, and often repatriates them.
The relationship between North and Jihem – which is still in the state of war – has improved significantly in recent months.
In this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pchjongjang for talks aimed at the halted denuclearization.
This led to a historic meeting of Presidents Donalda Trumpa and Kim Čong-una in Singapore, where they agreed on extensive conditions of cooperation in the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong accused the US of not making any progress on the issue of sanctions.
"Without any trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and there will be no way for us to be left on the one hand," Mr Ri said in a speech before the UN Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosie called Bretta Kavanaugh a "hysterical" and said he was inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
The democratic minority, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh a “hysterical” candidate and pointed out that thanks to its temperature it is inappropriate for service in the Supreme Court.
Pelosian made this note during a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help myself, but if any woman had made such a show, they would call it a hysterical," Pelosie said in her response to the Kavanaugh's fourth report before the Senate Court Commission.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected all accusations that he sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were still in puberty.
During his opening words, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes nearly crying and breathing while talking about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned democracy in the committee and stated that their charges against him were "a huge and coordinated attack" organized by liberals who were unable to pass over Hillary Clinton's prize in presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosie stated that Kavanaugh's report proved that he was not capable of working in the Supreme Court because he showed that he was against the Democrats.
"I think he has been disqualified by these declarations and the way he has been working in Clinton and Democrats," she said.
The Pelosian replied firmly to the question whether she would try to appeal to Kavanaugh in the event of his confirmation, even if the Democrats obtained a majority in the Snowese Republic.
“I will tell you this – if Congress does not tell the truth, then it is not only possible to work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court in which it is currently working,” Pelosie said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Court of Appeal.
Pelosian added that as a Democrat she was concerned about the potential results of Kavanaugha in court by the Law on friendly care or Roe vs. Wade because she was considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing of his previous confirmation in function, Kavanaugh rejected the answer to the question whether he would return any decision of the Supreme Court.
"There's no time for a hysterical, supposed person to come to court and expect us to just say "Yes, that's great," Pelosie said.
And women have to control it.
After the verbal events, months, and years of drought, it was impossible to escape without crying.
"We cry when we have a relationship," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continues: “The woman who once served as a director and who told me that she was also crying when she was pregnant, but she created a certain technique, which means that when she had a baby and started crying, she said to the person who spoke to her: “You may think I’m crying because I’m sad.
But I have a relationship."
And that's how she went on.
And I think it's great."
The tears are acceptable as a means of reaction to anger, partly because they are misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job where I worked at the office where men dominated men once I expressed my inexhaustible relationship with the crying, but the older, always cold manager, who was always a little scared, caught me by the church and dragged me to the warehouse.
"Never show them you're crying," she said.
"He doesn't know you have a relationship.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy that they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, a democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrived at a non-manly affair on the board of the Monkey Business and had to be out of the fight. Ms. Schroeder, deep frustrated, found that he had no reason why she could not examine her own presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a well thought-out decision," she laughed after 30 years.
"There were already seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snöhurka and seven sufferers."
Since the campaign had been running for a long time, however, it was unable to take steps to obtain contributions and thus committed not to compromise if it did not achieve $2 million in contributions.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1,000 to a male candidate would give it only $250.
"Do you think I'll get a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally carry out the campaign, she was simply convinced by her emotions – as an expression of her gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that forced her to earn money and focus on the voters more than on delegates and on the relationship with sexism, that she was totally tired.
"Maybe you would think I was nervously upset," said Mrs. Schroeder about how he reacted to the pressure.
"And you might think that my main sponsor was Kleneex.
I remember thinking about what they're going to write on my backstone.
"Plakkala"?
Why could a Chinese-American trade war be good for Beijing?
The US and China's initial trade peace has been heard and, although the fight is not far from fought, experts say that the trade between countries in the long term is useful for Beijing.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, gave the first warning this year that he considered China's exports including solar panels, steel and lead.
However, most of the largest scalars have seen the light of the world this week when new prices for the product were announced for 200 billion USD (250 billion GBP), which is practically half of China's exports to the USA.
Peking responded each time, the latest downgrading tariffs to five to ten percent of the 60 billion US goods imports.
China has tried to pay the same coin to the US and it is unlikely that the second largest economy of the world would collapse into the knee.
Even though China would like Washington to return to its original wheels, it would mean putting its requirements in place, but public detailing the American requirements would be simply humiliating for Chinese President Si Si 'in-Pching.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing could play its cards correctly, the US trade war could positively support China in the long term because it would reduce the mutual dependence of these two economies.
"The fact is that the rapid political decision of Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would lower the economy in both countries, which is much more dangerous than observers have already agreed," said Abigail Grace, a research co-operative, who is focusing on Asia in the thinking of the Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria claims to be prepared for voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding the country of more than seven years of war.
In his speech at the Valné Assembly, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouale indicated that conditions in the country are improving.
"The situation on the ground today is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas of destroyed terrorists into the normal state.
All the conditions for voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to leave the country due to terrorism are now fulfilled, as are the unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives.
The UN estimates that Syria has left more than 5.5 million inhabitants since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country with the need for humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mouale stated that the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in the construction of the dedicated country.
However, he stressed that we do not accept the conditional aid or aid from the countries sponsoring the attacks.
Europe has responded differently to the victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
The Evria team won Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the US team with final score 16,5 to 10,5 at Le Golf National on the edge of the trouble in France.
The United States has now lost six of its own on European soil, so it has not welcomed Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe once again gained the crown when Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn arrived with his team of 14.5 points that were needed for the United States strike.
The U.S. Star, Phil Mickelson, who fought most of the tournament, then fired the sword into the water for 3 pairs of 16 jacks and left Francesco Molinari's victory.
The Italian golf player Molinari then set up in all his bikes and became one of the 4 players and achieved the best score 5-0-0 since he was approved in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 players from the European team with the lowest rating, Thorbjor Olsen from Denmark.
The most valuable world player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Jan Poulter from England, who successfully graduated his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran eight Ryder Cups, Spain Sergio Garcia became the best European player with 25.5 points won for his career.
"I don't usually pay, but today I can't help.
It's been a hard year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy, really happy that I got the fire back.
Everything depends on the team, I'm glad I could help," said Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He sent a fire to his fellow John Rampo, who destroyed the American League of Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
"I feel incredible when I hit Tiger Woods, but I grew up following that guy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now registered a career record 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
Similar statistics of one of the best players all the time that got 14 biggest titles, which can only be compared to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has spent the entire weekend trying to find a fairaye, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played a golf course throughout the whole tournament.
Captain U.S. Jim Furyk, after his team’s disturbing results, said: “I’m proud of these guys, they really fought.
We really burned Europe this morning.
We really didn't do it.
I'm making a hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will relocate and move forward in cooperation with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee.
I like those 12 boys, I'm glad I could make them captain.
I really need to get out of here.
You've won us."
