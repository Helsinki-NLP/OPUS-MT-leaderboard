The members of the National Union of the Gallerian Countries are concerned that they might imagine they are "marionites"
More members of the National Assembly of the Galleries are confused because they have been suggested to change their title, i.e. to call them MWP (members of the Gallera Parliament).
This problem was caused by the plans to change the name of the Assembly of the Sea of Galilee.
The members of the National Assembly of the Gallerian countries present on the political scene are afraid that this would cause rediscoveration.
A member of the Laburist Party of the National Assembly of the Sea of Galilee is concerned that "he remains with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Gallera: "twp" means "obtuz" and "pwp" means "female matter".
A member of the Gallerian Party of the National Assembly of the Gallerian Party said that the group "is not pleased" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said that the group had a "open" attitude towards the change of name, but that it also observed that "MWP" was similar to "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" is pronounced in the Sea of Galilee as in the letter "u" in the English language spoken in Yorkshire.
The Association Commission, which is currently preparing the legislation to introduce the change in the name, stated: "The final decision on how the members are appointed will certainly depend on even the members concerned."
The Law of 2017 on the Government of the Sea of Galilee offered the Assembly the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which led many of them to want to use the "Parliament of the Sea of Galilee".
With regard to the title of the members of the National Assembly of the Sea of Galilee, the Commission preferred "members of Parliament of the Sea of Galilee" or "WMP", but the "MWP" option received the most votes in the public consultation.
It appears that the members of the National Assembly of the Galleries have suggested alternative options, but the attempt to reach a consensus might give Elin Jones, the president of the Steering Committee, who is expected to send the bill on amendments within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes to the way the Assembly works, including the rules on descalculation of the members and structure of the Committee's system.
The members of the National Assembly will have the last word on their title when the law is rejected.
Macedonians vote for the referendum on the change in the country's name
This Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will express their views on the change in their country's name in the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The popular vote was organised to resolve an old debate for several decades with Greece, the neighbouring country, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Government of Athens has for a long time insisted that the name of its neighbour in the north represents a claim on his territory and has repeatedly rejected Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO .
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opposition to the Plebiscite on the change of name, said he would not take this vote into account.
However, the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change of names is only a compromise that will allow them to join the EU and NATO.
Bishop's Bishop's Clubs St. Martin stopped fighting as a result of the problems facing the churches in Harlem
"In historical terms, the veterans of the place I spoke to told me that you found a bar and a church on every street corner," Adams said.
"Today, there are no bars and no churches."
He also said that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People socialize otherwise today," he said.
"The bars no longer have the role of a room for the whole library, where people usually hang out."
And with regard to the churches, it is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will spend faster than expected by the leaders and that, “more sooner or later, the economy will be the same.”
He added that the churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condoms filled with people who will not support the remaining sanctuarys of the castle.
"Most people who will buy condoms in these buildings will be white-colored," he said, "this will therefore speed up closing churches, as it is less likely that many people moving in these condoms will become members of the churches in question."
Both churches were built by white-colored congregations before Harlem became a metropolis of African-American people – the metropolitan community of St. Martin in 1870, after a decade.
The original methodological congregation, formed by white people, moved from the area after 1930.
A congregation of African-American people, who engages in religious activities nearby, took over the building.
The Church of St. Martin was occupied by an African-American congregation, led by Governor John Howard Johnson, who had banned trades from 125th Street, a major road for the purchases of Harlem, which opposed the engagement or promotion of African-American people.
A fire that took place in 1939 affected the building very much, but Johnson’s jealous parents planned to rebuild and included the carilion in it.
Reverence David Johnson, son of Johnson's father and successor to St. Martin's church, called the "Creation of the Germans".
The expert who applied the cartoon in July described it as "a cultural coumara" and "a historical instrument of non-replacement".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, further stated that it was the first career in the world played by an African-American musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who spent 18 years in a larger career at the Riverside church.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced at St. Martin.
What was heard from St. Martin in recent months was a complicated story, which included architects and contractors, some brought from church diacones, others from episcopal diocese.
The Sacristia, the ruling entity of the parish, formed from the diocese, wrote the diocese in July to complain that the diocese "will seek to pass costs" to the sacrament, even if it was not involved in the occupation of architects and contractors sent by diocese.
Some of the enoriasts complained of lack of transparency that proved diocese.
A rabbit hurt a 13-year-old child trying to catch men in California
According to the authorities, on Saturday, a rabbit attacked and injured a 13-year-old child while trying to catch men in California on the day of the start of the Homaral season.
The attack took place about 7:00 in the morning, near the beach Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said for the KSWB-TV post in San Diego that he spent about half an hour with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy crying for help and then moved in with a group that helped him get him out of the water.
Hammel also said that at first he thought the boy was happy that he had taken a man, but then he realized that the cry "Must me!
He touched me!"
The entire keyboard was closed, Hammel said he noticed when he arrived at the boy.
"I cried to all who were in the water, and I said to them, 'It's a snake in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was taken with the helicopter at Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
You don't know the species of the horn responsible for the attack.
Salvamar, Captain Larry Giles, said at a press conference that a rabbit has been observed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it is not a species of rabbit that represents a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma in the upper part of the throne.
The authorities restricted access to the Ponto beach from Casablad to Swami from Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and security reasons .
Giles further mentioned that there are more than 135 species of reindeer in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
The Retaliary Saninsbury plans to consolidate its position on the market of fruit and vegetables products from the British Sea
Sainsbury buys Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, placing on the radio with entertainment products in the style of a universal store, with specialized sales assistants.
As part of a consolidation of position on the market for fruit products from the British Sea, with a value of 2.8 billion esterline lire, which continues to grow, although domestic and fashion sales are not on the rise, the largest breeding grounds will be tested in 11 country stores and will be integrated into more stores in the next year if they prove successful.
Investment in the beauty industry comes in the context of which supermarkets are looking for a way to use the previous space for televisions, microwaves and household products.
The representatives of the dealer Sainsbury stated that the number of entertainment products he offers will be doubled, reaching up to 3,000 products, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas, like those of Boots stores.
The supermarket also relaxs its range of machinery products, Boutique, which means that most of the products are intended for ordinary people, a request which is most met among young buyers.
In addition, the products of the French dealer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two Sainsbury launch magazines, for testing purposes, the first open week in Croydon, south of London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second part of this year.
Online purchases and the tendency to buy smaller quantities of food each day from the nearest food store mean that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of the Sansbury dealer, said that exports will show more than ever as universal stores, because the supermarkets are trying to deal with large retail shops, Aldi and Lidl, which offer more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury included both products from Argos outlet in hundreds of stores, as well as Habitats, since it purchased both chains two years ago, which means it recorded increases in food sales, as well as increased profit.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to re-compensate the compartments of pharmaceutical products and fraud failed.
Sainsbury tried to merge with Boots at the beginning of 2000, but the negotiations stopped after a disagreement about how to share the benefits of Boots magazines in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury sold the pharmaceutical business that included 281 magazines, the company Celesio, which holds Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million sterline readings, over three years later.
This means Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding an extended range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four magazines.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of the Sansbury dealer's business, said: "I have transformed the aspect of our radios with entertainment products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized instruction of our colleagues, who will be available to offer you advice.
Our brand range can adapt to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations turn us into an extraordinary place to buy fruit products, revolutionising the old way of buying."
Peter Jones is angry after Holly Willoughby retired from an 11 million-litered contract.
The protagonist of the "Dragons' Den", Peter Jones, is angry after the show TV Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a contract worth 11 million pounds of sterline with his lifestyle-style company, to focus on its new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time to engage in their project on Truly brand, which includes accessories and household items.
The couple's company was compared to Goop brand, held by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The exhibition “This Morning”, at the age of 37, announced on Instagram that it will be withdrawn.
Holly Willoughby generated Peter Jones's anger, the protagonist of the "Dragons" show, ultimately withdrawing from their business offering lifestyle services to focus on their new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became angry when one of the most popular people on television recognized Tuesday, during a tense sitting at the headquarters of his empire of business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds of sterling, no longer allowed them to dedicate their brands, Truly, which includes accessories and household items.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and almost doubled Willoughby's property, with an estimated 11 million pounds of sterline.
After Willoughby, at the age of 37, announced Instagram that he would give up his contract for Truly, Jones left Britain to flee one of his holiday homes.
One source stated: “Truly was one of Holly’s priorities.
It would be her future in the long term, for the next two decades.
The decision to withdraw has been sought out all over the world.
No one came to believe what happened yesterday, it was less until the launch.
There is a full warehouse with products at Marlow headquarters that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the "This Morning" emissions from the best sold from the UK could lead to the loss of millions, as a result of investments in products such as pearls and lamps, clothing objects and household items, as well as the possible further delay in launching.
It can also represent the end of an extended friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, are friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby put the Truly brand base together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined them as director in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones has 40% of Baldwin's TV production company's shares.
Willoughby will become the Ambassador of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as the boss of the "I'm A Celebrity" ITV.
A close source of Jones said last night: “We don’t want to talk about his business. ”
I was very hard, and then "I loved you"
He made jokes in the light of the criticisms he will receive from journalists because he made a comment that some would consider him "no president" and that he has such a positive attitude about North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a big step back?
Trump said by imitating a voice from the "reporter".
"I didn't take a step back."
He said Kim was interested in having another meeting after the first Singapore meeting in June described by Trump as a huge step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have stopped.
On the best of three months from the Singapore summit in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leaders worldwide at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not observe a "responsive answer" from the United States on the previous disarmament demarcations of North Korea.
Instead, it noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure in this regard.
Trump had a more optimistic view of his motivational speech.
"It's all going well with North Korea," he said.
"We must be heading towards a North Korean war.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He also said that his efforts to improve Kim's relationship had positive results: stopping rocket tests, supporting the release of hostages and returning US soldiers.
She also found the unusual way to talk about Kim's relationship.
"It's easy to deal with you as a president, but if I were to behave like this, instead of 10,000 people outside, who are trying to get into this endless arena, it would be about 200 people," Trump said, showing to the crowd that is in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island causing hundreds of people to die.
According to the Lombok summit, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of the island of Lombok has been displaced, there has been no national disaster, a condition necessary for the declaration of aid actions at the international level.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very clear about the fact that they do not require international assistance, so it is a difficult situation," said Sumbung.
Although the foundation "Save the Children" is trying to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known if foreign personnel are allowed access to the place.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Disasters Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities evaluate the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to aid efforts.
In view of Indonesia's constant costs, it is unlikely that the country will continue to be insufficiently prepared for the anger of nature.
Although repairs were built for tsunamis in Aceh , they are not met very often on other coasts .
It appears that the lack of a siren warning in the event of tsunamis in Palu, although a warning was issued in this sense, could have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of circumstances, the journey between the islands of Indonesia proves to be a challenge.
The natural disasters are complex and more so.
A hospital that has stopped in Lombok to deal with the victims of torture is heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place where the new calamity has occurred.
President Joko Widodo proposed that the improvement of the emergency infrastructure in Indonesia be the central point of his electoral campaign and allocate money for roads and railways.
But the lack of funds affected Joko's administration, which will take part in a new electoral campaign next year.
Joko also faces persistent pressure from the sections of Indonesia because the majority of Muslims have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes, as gangs of Christians and Muslims were thrown into the streets, using swords, bows and arrows, as well as other handguns.

The number of deaths caused by tsunami in Indonesia reached 832
The number of deaths caused by the drought and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, according to the National Disaster Agency, on Sunday morning.
More people were caught under the ruins of buildings covered by the ceiling of 7.5 which took place in the spring and had declared values up to 6 metres, said the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, during a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has a population of over 380,000 people, was covered by the remains caused by the collapse of the buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man, suspected of killing a woman in prison
A murder investigation was filed after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The woman, 44 years old, was found at 7:55 in the morning, with injuries caused by incarceration at Grayson Mews on John Street, and was arrested by a suspected man of murder.

Cromwell's status in Parliament becomes the most recent memorial monument affected by the changes in "recording history"
It would represent a poetic justice for the destruction in the Taliban style of such cultural and religious artifacts of England, carried out by its fanatic Puritans.
But Cromwell's company described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as "a crazy" and "a attempt to re-write history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, stated: “It was inevitable in the debate on the removal of states such as Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside the Westminster Palace to become a hostage.
The icononclam of the English civil wars was neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe a wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for his uncle Thomas's actions in the past century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many believe is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said for The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as Parliament's advocate against external pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Regardless of whether it is about a precise representation, this is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But certainly, the conflict in the mid-19th century has determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure, which represents a part of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered."
A pig caused the death of a farmer in China
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southern China, according to local press agencies.
The man, identified only after the name of the "Yuan" family, was found dead after he was split into an art and was covered with blood, near a pig farm located on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou, according to the daily edition of Morning Post in South China.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pigs vaccines to a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It seems that he came with his uncle from the nearby province of Yunnan Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his wife found him dead and found out that the door of a neighboring coat was open.
This said that in the kitchen there is a porcupine of large size with blood on the throat.
Lawyers confirmed that an approximately 300 kg pig caused the farmer's death, according to the report.
"My brother's legs were full of blood and ends," said the widow, whose family name is "Wu", for Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market today at 4:40 a.m. to feed their pigs.
About an hour later, his body was found.
The animal that caused the man's death did not belong to Yuan, nor to his faith.
A market representative said for Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police tried the crime scene.
Yuan's family and authorities seem to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of dogs that attacked people have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
After 10 years, because of a 300 kg pig, a man in the Gallerian country was blocked in his tractor until his wife came to scare and take the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba declared to CBC News that dogs are not aggressive in a normal way, and that the taste of blood may trigger such reactions."
‘Just play.
They like to move, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to remind them of respect," he said.
The Rosa Urgan, who lost her in intensity, will cause torrential rains in the southwestern United States
As foretold, Rosa’s hurricane is losing its intensity as it moves to the more recent waters off the coast of northern Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain that will cause floods in northern Mexico and in the southern United States in the coming days.
Rosa records sales conditions at a speed of 85 km/h, being a category 1 hurricane on Sunday, from 5 a.m. and was located about 600 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is recommended that Rosa arrive in the north on Sunday.
In the meantime, it began to form a depressive zone over the Pacific Ocean and move east, to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula, months, in the form of tropical storm, it will begin to push the intense tropical humidity from the north to the southern United States.
Monday, Rosa will bring precipitations up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then, the tropical humidity that will interact with the depressive zone will generate abundant rains in the south-west in the following days.
Local precipitations between 3 and 10 cm will cause dangerous floods, floods of waste and, if possible, land degradation in the desert.
The intense tropical humidity will cause rain rates up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in parts south of Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitations covered between 5 and 10 cm are expected in the south-west part, especially in the majority of Arizona.
It is possible to have rapid floods due to rapid deterioration conditions as a result of the nature of tropical rain.
You are not recommended to venture into the desert on the ground, given the threat of tropical rain.
The strong rain could cause the canyons to be transformed into violent rivers, and storms will bring local sales in raffles and prawns.
The nearby depression zone will bring torrential rains in the south coast of California.
It is possible to precipitate nearly 2 cm, which could determine less fluids of residuals and aluenecoes.
These will be the first precipitations in the region, in the winter season.
Tropical floods will begin to approach Arizona in the second part of the Sunday and in the first part of the month, before the rain spreads further in the evening and in the morning.
The intense precipitations will spread in so-called "father of harvests" Tuesdays and will continue until Wednesdays.
In October there will be intense temperature changes in the US, as the Arctic region will become colder, but tropicals remain quite hot.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday, dramatic temperature differences are encountered at the central U.S. area level.
There is a difference of about 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the long summer heat will try to form and expand again.
It is recommended that a large part of the central and eastern regions of the USA be confronted with a hot start of October, with temperatures up to 27 degrees in extended areas, from the south to certain parts of the north-east.
Tuesday, New York City could reach 27 degrees, with about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows large temperatures over the middle of the US summer until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people followed Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people followed the press statement supported by the candidate at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of a sexual attack that was alleged to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, the political confrontation continued, TV posts interrupting the normal Friday program for an hour ago: an agreement concluded between Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona to conduct an investigation of the charges within a week.
Ford said in front of the judge committee that it's 100% sure that Kavanaugh took her while she was in the state of Hebrews and that she tried to get her out of a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in the context of an intense argument, said it's 100% sure this didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people would have followed the hearing on Friday.
The company listed the average vision on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble controlling the people he sees from the office.
To put this in perspective, this audience is similar to the one for a football game in play-off or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, of which opinion groups strongly supported Kavanaugh's number, was in front of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the morning hearing.
The ABC was located on the second floor, with a number of 3.26 million televisions.
According to Nielsen, CBS was followed by 3.1 million people, 2.14 million NCBs, 2.89 million MSNBCs and 2.52 million CNNs.
The interest remained at a high level after hearing.
Flake was in the center of the Friday drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican has issued a statement that it will vote in favour of Kavanaugh, it was filmed by the CNN and CBS Chambers tomorrow morning as protestors shouted at it and he tries to move into an elevator at a hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He's been looking down for a few minutes while people checked him out, and everything was transmitted directly to CNN.
"I'm right here, in front of you," said a woman.
"You think he's telling us the truth?
It was said to him, "You are strong, while such women are helpless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before closing the elevator, he would have more to say at the committee's seat.
Televisions were broadcast directly later as part of the Judicial Committee to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for the vote by the Senate.
But Flake said he'd do this only if the FBI agreed to analyze the charges against the nomination next week, which is called for minority democracy.
Blake was convinced, mostly, of the conversations with his friend, Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and many senators after that.
Flake's election was important, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation on charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister charges criticism of "political games" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses criticism of her plans to leave the European Union of "political games" with the future of the British Mary and the subsidizing of national interests in an interview for Sunday Times.
Theresa May, Prime Minister Maria Brittany, attended the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview that followed his photograph on the first page of the newspaper, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued an attack on its Brexit plan, such as the Chequers plan, saying that the proposal for the British Sea and the European Union to collect mutual tariffs was "rically complete".
Wayde Sims shooting: The police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected he shot the LSU player mortally
The police arrested a suspect in case of the deaths of Wade Sims, the LSU basketball player, aged 20.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested and imprisoned, accused of murder of grade 2, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities published the film of the encounter between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his eye during the beating.
The police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, according to WAFB, CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police say it recognized the fact that he killed Wade.
His prison was established at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Legal Medicine Bureau Baton Rouge published a preliminary report tomorrow, stating that death was caused by a head shot through the throat.
The Department welcomes the police force of Louisiana, the state's criminal lab, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area, for the assistance provided in the investigation, which led to the arrest in question.
LSU's athletic director, Joe Alleva, thanked the police for "illegality and the search for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The attacker with a height of 1.98 m grew in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, played basketball for LSU.
Last season, marked, on average, 5.6 points and had 2.6 recoverys.
Tomorrow morning, LSU basketball team coach Will Wade said that the team is "damaged" and "searched" by Wade's death.
"This thing worries me all the time," said Wade.
A volcano threw a cholera tower over the city of Mexico City
The census from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexico's citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after its activity in crater was announced and 183 gas and lead emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The centre monitors more vibrations and vibrations.
The images of socializing networks present cenoisies on machine parfries in Mexican City's cartels, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is 72 km south of the capital, after a magnitude of 7.1 squatting the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The "Don Goyo" right wheel is active in 1994.
Intervention between the police and the Catalan separatists before the independence vote was announced
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after the pro-independence protestors broke up with the Jandars, the first anniversary of the vote for the Catalonia sequencing of thousands of protestors.
A group of masked pro-separators held away from the yards have bombed it with a pothole and a pothole, believing dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
The investigation was intensified later, using the forces to control the situation.
Within a few hours, the pro-independence groups scand "We don't look, we don't forgive," while the Union's protesters shouted "Frequently Spain!".
14 people received medical care for minor injuries caused during protests, according to local press.
The tensions remain at a high level in the region that wants to become independent one year after the referendum of 1 October was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters have chosen, in a coherent majority, to become independent, although participation in the vote has been reduced, and those against the secession have voted mostly.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 100 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting at the voting centres in the region, with violent beatings.
The pro-independence groups campaigned over the night of Friday evening to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to choose a new way.
Narcis Termes, aged 68, an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer has any hope of gaining independence from Catalonia.
“ Last year I lived some of the most beautiful moments in my life.
I saw my parents crying with joy that I can vote, but now we have nothing to do," he said.
Despite obtaining a vital victory, but strict, in the regional elections of December last year, the pro-independent Catalan parties tried to keep progress in this year, many of the most famous leaders found themselves, either in exile or in detention, waiting for judgment for the role of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded his protest phone in support of the police, said the politicians of both parties had fed the conflict.
"The situation becomes more tense," he said.
Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the new Catholic leaders who were imprisoned at the end of last year, announced that he would apply to the elections for the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate at the European elections, it is the best way to denounce regret in democratic values and the repression I have seen from the Spanish government," he said.

Menga's hit helped the Livingston team win 1-0 in front of the Rangers team
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave victory
Livingston left the Rangers team unrepudiated, Steven Gerrard reaching the second rank in 18 matches, as the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's hit proved to make the difference while Gary Holt's team played the same level with the Hibernian in the second round.
Gerrard's team remains without a victory in the Premier League this season and confronts Hearts leaders, behind them with eight points, next Sunday.
Before this, Rangers is building Rapid Vienna in Europe League today.
In the meantime, Livingston continues to blame the division for up to six games, Holt's main coach still feels like gambling because he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses his chance against the Red Visitors
Holt's team should have gone much ahead before he wrote, and their orientation caused all kinds of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to cross and try to jump over the gate, then Alan Lithgow managed to jump a long way after he entered through the lightning to intercept the signal sent to Craig Halkett's head.
The guys were happy to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could make visitors trouble with free shots.
And that was the way the crucial gorge came.
Rangers accepted a free fight, and Livingston managed to open up, Declan Gallagher and Robinson working to pass Menga, who was shot and marked from the center.
At that time, Rangers dominated the possession, but faced the inevitable defense of the host, and the porter Liam Kelly was no longer in great trouble in the rest of the game.
This game model continued in the second round, although Alfredo Morelos strengthened a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman did not succeed against Allan McGregor from Rangers, and Lithgov gave a long shot from another player of the Livingston team.
The steps in the diagonal continued to come to which the Livingston team, but not successful, and the two petitions - after Halket burned Glenn Middleton and after a while - were not accepted.
"Fenomenal game" offered by Livingston – analysis
Lasadair Lamont from BBC Scotch on Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed the expectations of an ascending trajectory.
Their game and team style have not changed since the return to top, but the values must be given to Holt for the way he trained the team since he took it.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with excellent organizational defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble during the entire party.
But the Rangers weren't too inspired.
Although they had good performance since they were led by Gerard, they didn't reach the same standards.
The gorges have been unsuccessful, they have managed to catch the door of free opponents once, and this should be a signal for Rangers, which is located in the middle of the class.
mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
It was Saturday (September 29th), when Turkish and German leaders met in Berlin to pick up the breakfast.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan in Germany to remedy relations between NATO alliances.
These are disproportionate because of problems such as human rights, freedom of movement and accession of Turkey to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city boasts the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world, outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 in front of the mosque, but enough supporters were gathered nearby to see the president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan, the majority of the Kurts, and they heard the voice, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive him with the arms open in the country.
Objections in the contradiction reflect the division of a visitor who is considered to be a hero of some Turkish people in Germany and of others.
Road accident in Deptford: a biker dies after a car crash
A biker died after a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place at the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded street in Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10:15.
The car driver stopped, and the paramedics showed up at the scene, but the man died at the scene.
The accident took place only a few months after another biker died after an accident that took place on Childers Street, where the driver fled from the spot, which is about a thousand of the place where the accident took place on Saturday.
The metropolitan police said the officers were trying to identify the man and inform him of his duties.
The access is restricted in the area, the bus track is due, and motorcyclists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured after a beating
Six prison officers were injured following a high-security prison for men, a representative of the prison said.
On Sunday, a break at the HMP Long Martin from Worcestershire at about 9:30, this is ongoing.
Specialised officers have been brought in to take up employment, in which they are eight detained, isolated in a shelter.
The officers were treated in front of the place for minor injuries to the front.
A prison spokesman stated: “The assistance of the prison staff has been requested to deal with an incident in the course of the HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical attention after they were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we have very clear rules on responsibility, which will be transferred to the police and may take a longer period of time after grace."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 detainees, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June it was reported that the governor of the prison needed hospital care after an attack by a prisoner.
And last year, in October, officials who are dealing with torture were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, the staff being attacked with billboards.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are at risk of being flooded because of Rosa's hurricane.
It is rare to have a tropical depression in Arizona, but this is pretty likely to occur at the beginning of the next week, because the remaining energy resources of the Rosa hurricane will be used in the south-west desert, presenting a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued warnings of rapid flooding for the months and March in the district of Arizona, south and east of Nevada, southern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is suggested that Rosa will have a direct trajectory to Phoenix on Tuesday, and on the second part of the month will cause precipitation.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix announced in a message on Twitter that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a hurricane or tropical depression at a distance of about 320 km from Phoenix in 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane with an action on a distance of about 60 km from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Centre for Uregane foresee precipitations between 5 and 10 cm, with quantities isolated from up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim from Arizona.
In other areas of the south-west desert, including in the centre of the Stáncoși and Marele Basin mountains, quantities covered between 3 and 5 cm will be recorded, with possible total quantities up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although floods represent a very serious problem, in some areas torrential rains will be beneficial because the south-west is faced with drought problems.
According to the U.S. Seed Monitor, at least 40% of Arizona is faced with the least severe, respectively the second largest category", information on weather.com.
First, Rosa's hurricane will lead to landslides in the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who still has uragan power on Sunday morning, with a wind of up to 136 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north, 19 km per hour.
The storm will meet more recently in the Pacific and, as a result, it will decline.
Thus, it is expected that it will produce land raids in Mexico, with a tropical storm power in the afternoon or in the evening of the month.
The torrential floods in Mexico could be significant, presenting a high flood risk.
"There are expected torrential rains ranging from 8 to 10 cm" from Baja California to the north-west Sonorei, and can reach 25 cm", according to weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north, in Mexico, as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the morning of March, as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and reaching south of Utah in the night of March.
"The main danger represented by Rosa or her remains is the extreme torrential rains from Baja California, northwestern Sonorei and the desert from the southern United States," said a representative of the National Centre for Urigane.
It is recommended that these rain will produce hot floods, which will endanger people's lives, and will bring floods of habitats into deserts, as well as earthquakes in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three adolescents and a 20-year-old man were arrested as a result of an attempted murder after a 16-year-old person was found with complaints caused by incarceration in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, Saturday, about 04:00.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is in a stable state.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested tonight in Radstock area, according to the Avon and Somerset police.

Trump said Kavanaugh faced the "much and hands" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the gentle and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting of Wheeling, Virginia of West.
Trump further stated that Kavanaugh faced the "much and hands" of the Democratic Party during its nomination.
Joi, Kavanaugh filed testimony to Congress, denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that she had been sexually abused ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also filed testimony in a sitting on her claim.
The president said Saturday that "the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, quality and courage that day."
"A confirmation vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the best lies in this generation's legal domain," he said many supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to the nomination of Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the Republican presence in the interim elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our life.
I'm not a candidate, but, somehow, a candidate," he said.
"For this reason, I express above all my positive opinion on the candidates whom you consider to be outstanding."
Trump argued that democracy is in a mission to "resist and ban".
It is recommended that the first procedural vote in the Senate since Kavanaugh's nomination will take place the following Friday, a GOP leader's assistant said to CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by the tsunami in Indonesia, the number growing
At least 384 people were killed, many of them being taken by the heavy values that hit the beaches, when a powerful tsunami and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the authorities declared Saturday.
Hundreds of people came to a festival on the beach in Palu City, when the values with a height of six meters hit the beach in the amurg, people were taken by water and destroyed everything along their way.
Tsunami was followed by a 7.5-degree cutter.
"When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people still saw their activities on the beach and did not act immediately, becoming such victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the BNPB disaster relief agency, said at a press conference in Jakarta.
"Tsunami brought his own cars, boots, houses, hunting everything on the way," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled along at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the country.
It added that some people had to climb into the trenches to escape tsunamis and survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The photos published by the disaster agency present more destroyed buildings and stores, damaged and damaged doors, as well as a water-contained mosque.
Saturday, the rehearsals continued to destroy the city found on the coast.
A series of tortures was felt in a zone with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) of Indonesia stated that the energy emitted by the power of the winter was about 200 times greater than the nuclear bomb power of Hiroshima from World War II.
The geographical structure of the city, which is located at the end of a long and narrow golf course, probably intensified the expansion of the tsunami, added its representative.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
The victims' troops were found trapped under the walls of the damaged buildings, he said, along with 540 injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said that the victims and payouts could be larger than the coast of 300 km north of Palu, a area called Dondrea, which is closer to the epicenter of the coast.
The communications were "full of confusion, without any information" from Dongrea, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," said the Red Cross, adding that his staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
He added: "This is already a tragedy, but it could be worse."
Saturday, the agency was criticised for not informing the fact that a tsunami would hit Palu, although the authorities said that the values arrived at the time of the warning.
In the posts on socializing networks, a man found at the top floor of a building may be warned suddenly that the tsunami approaches people on the adjacent road.
Within a few minutes, a water wall is hit by land, playing with these buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the material.
The tsunami and tsunami caused a major interruption of electricity, which blocked communications in Palu, making it difficult to coordinate the efforts of the authorities to save.
The army has started sending cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities have declared, but evacuated persons still need food and other basics.
The city airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has planned a visit to the evacuation centers from Palu for Sunday.
The number of deaths caused by tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800 people.
The situation is extremely serious.
While the staff Word Vision from Dodrea arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees are thrown into improvised trailers at the office court, they passed on devastating scenes, Doseba said.
He added: "They told me they saw many destroyed houses."
The situation is very serious.
Even if aid groups have begun to continue aid operations in the event of disaster, some people have complained that foreign professionals with comprehensive expertise have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to the regulations of Indonesia, the financial resources, the delivery of materials and personnel can only be reached at the place of production of a catalyticity if a national disaster zone is declared.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Red Cross of Indonesia.
"After the government says, "Yes, this is a national disaster," we can start international assistance actions, but nothing has yet been announced."
After the second night of the fall and the tsunami in Palu, friends and families of the missing hope that their loved ones will be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
Saturday, a boy was kicked out of a channel.
Sunday, rescue personnel released a woman who was under two days of ruin with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the national parapants team, trained for the Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia, two of the missing parapants pilots.
Other people at Roa Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandaji, were her students.
"In view of the experience in the field of parapanta activities, I have my own emotional experience," she said.
Gendon told how, in a few hours of the broadcast of the news about the appearance of the Roa Roa Hotel in the community of sport practitioners with parapeda, he sent desperate messages to whatsApp competitors from Palu who participated in the festival organized on the beach.
But in the right of his messages there appeared only one grey bib, and not two white bibs.
"I think that means the messages have not been transmitted," he said.

Kanye West: The rapper changes its scene name to "Ye"
Rapper Kanye West changes his scene name to "Ye".
This week, it announced the change on Twitter: "the person officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41 years old, says "Yes" for some time and uses this title as title of the album's optical album, launched in June.
This change comes before its appearance at the Saturday Night Live show, where it is expected to launch its new album, Yandhi.
This is due to the issue in place of the song Ariana Grande, which cancelled "for the sake of emotional nature", said the emission producer.
In addition to the fact that it is an abbreviation of the current scene name, West stated earlier that this word has a religious significance for him.
“ I think 'ye' is the most frequently met word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you',' said West at the beginning of this year, during the discussion on the title of the album with the Big Boy radio gazda.
"So I am you, I am new, it is about us.
It all started from "Kanye", which means the only one, and reached "Ye", which is a reflection of our good, rare, vague and whole things.
The album is more reflection on what we as individuals are."
He's one of the most rappers they've chosen to change their scene name.
Sean Combs had countless scene names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
And an former West-al-laborator, JAY-Z, changed his name, sometimes in short, others without, as well as in great letters.
President of Mexico promises not to use military forces against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military forces against civilians, once near the country of the 50th anniversary of a bloody repression against the students.
Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised Tlatelolco Plaza that "he will never use the army to suppress the Mexican people".
The troops turned to a passive market demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when students' left movements were growing in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by offering monthly grants to those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He said that the shadow and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double the funding for IA
While China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends for research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and user of artificial intelligence, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after more members of the U.S. government made announcements about IA, even if in the US there is no official strategy for artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China presented the plan last year: it proposes to be the first on IA innovation until 2030.
"Dubling the budget for the IA research would be a good start, given that all the other countries are far behind the US and that we are looking for the next IA findings," Lee said.
The duplication of funds could double the chances that the next major implementation in the IA area will be carried out in the US, Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "Superpots IA: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the Innovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's most prominent companies, Face ++.
In 1980, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an IA system that won American player Othello, which was the best in the area at the time, and later was executive director at Microsoft Research and the presidents of the Google branch in China.
Lee appreciated the previous competitions of the US governments in technology, such as Robotics Challenge of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects, and asked when it will be next, to help identify the following vision.
Researchers in the United States must often work hard to get government funds, Lee said.
"China doesn't put drinks in all of the academic leaders, but the corporations," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired notable graduates from universities to work at IA in recent years.
Lee said that the changes in immigration policy could help the US to intensify the efforts of the IA.
"I think it should be offered automatically to doctors in IA," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued a Development Plan for the New Artificial Intelligence Generations in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides financial support to persons from academic institutions such as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations offer money to researchers in the United States, but academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of the year, the Department of Defence of the United States established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, with a view to involving partners in the field and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a selection committee in the field of artificial intelligence.
This month, the U.S. Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced an investment worth $2 billion for an initiative called "AI Next".
At the same time, the NSF invests more than $100 million per year in the research of artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, no changes have been made to the legislation of the United States aimed at creating a Commission for National Security in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians will vote in referendum if they want to change the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in the framework of a referendum if they want the name of the country to be changed into the 'North Republic of Macedonia', a change that would solve an old debate with Greece, which was opposed to its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which covers a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighbouring country is a claim on its territory and has opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments reached agreement in June with the new name proposed, but opposition nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the people of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and that a polling campaign had raised doubts as to the vote, since it was possible not to reach a minimum of 50%, required for the referendum to be validated.
The question on the referendum ballot will be, "Do you agree with accession to the EU and NATO, accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is a price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that has resulted from the destruction of Yugoslavia, in order to be accepted into entities such as the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the country's future, so that young Macedonians will live free under the shadow of the European Union, because that means safer lives for all of us," Olivera Georgievska said at the age of 79 in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many Members of Parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
In order for the name to be changed, a two-thirds round is needed in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no irregularities had been reported until 13:00.
However, participation was only 16%, compared with 34% at the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of the voting rights persons presented to the vote.
"I have come to vote for my children and for our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, a voter from Skopje, the capital of the country.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, voted for the referendum on the change in the name of Macedonia, which will allow him to join NATO and enter the European Union.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, prepared a small-scale scene and placed a seat in front of the high court of those who will vote for the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with the front, not the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we do not want to be named Macedonia, we can move to other countries, such as China and Russia, and we can become part of the European Union."
Prime Minister Zaev stated that joining NATO will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, which has a rate of more than 20%.
"I think the majority will be in favour of the change of name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of joining NATO and the EU," Zaev said after the vote.
This said that a result in favour of the change of name would be “confirming our future”.
According to a poll published last month by the Policy Research Institute, between 30% and 43% of citizens with voting rights will participate in the referendum, with the number of participants required.
According to another Sunday, performed by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour of the change.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the vote must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first serious battle at the pro-vestic government's level of policy since the government's take-up last month.
Video: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City is able to cross the entire Bridgeton team and march a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to cross the Brighton team and win the Manchester City team on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Looks like Aguero was incredibly easy to walk in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker took a step in the middle of the ground at the beginning of the sequence.
He moved very quickly through three defence players from Brighton, before reaching the free side of the ground.
Then Aguero woke up by four players of the opposite team.
He managed to pass through a defense, and then he crossed many other opponents on the side of the Brighton team.
After that, he took a step left, the balloon coming to Sterling.
The English attacker sent Aguero's balloon back, which hit the ball with the right foot, able to avoid him on the bridge from Brighton, Matthew Ryan, with a ear to the right side of the port.
"Aguero faces some problems on his feet," said the reporters Pep Guardiola, the manager of the Manchester City team.
"I discussed with him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he signed a gol at that time."
But Sterling is the one who got their initial advantage for Azuri in the Premier League game.
The Goll came in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a step deep on the Brighton team's territory at that stage.
Then he took a look at Leroy Sane's left arm.
Sane pulled the balloon several times until he sent Sterling's passport, which he sent to the port.
The Aziri attacker hit the balloon to the beach just before heading out of the ground.
Manchester City will meet on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m., with Hoffenheim in the group phase, on Rhine-Neckar-Arena, in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make a joke in the game against Rockies.
With the national team removed from the competition in play-off, there were not too many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win Sunday in the game against the Colorado Rockies team, but only if there are still involvements in the play-off for Rockies, which has an advantage with a game ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
Rockies got at least an unlikely place, with a 5-2 victory against the national team in the evening, but still trying to keep their first title of division.
"Even if we don't play for anything, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere from here, from Denver, along with many, and the other team would probably play at the highest level of any point I could encounter this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in these circumstances?"
The national team has not yet announced the player who will open the game on Sunday, but according to sources, it is intended to let Scherzer first hit in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be at the opening of the game with number 34, had a warm-up session on Thursday and will be released in normal conditions this Sunday.
The Washington Environment has a score of 18-7 and an ERA of 2,53 and 300 rates in 220 and 2/3 matches in this season.
Trump expresses his support in West Virginia
The President referred to the situation regarding the decision taken by the Supreme Court in relation to Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the Republican presence in the interim elections.
"All our effort is in play in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important choices in our life.
This is one of the great, not candidate, but actually candidate, so I try to support the good candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, radical group of democracies, you see what is happening right now.
And I'm determined to regain power by using any necessary means, you can see their wickedness.
They don't care who I hurt, who has to get out to get power and control, they want to have power and control, and we won't give it."
This said that democracies are in a mission of "resistance and ban".
"And you can see this in the last four days," he said, describing Democrats as "frozens and evils, hypocrites and liars."
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Democratic Party, who is a member of the Senate's Judicial Committee, which was strongly criticized by the public.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
What do you mean?
No, um... I... wait a minute-- that was the stupidest body language I've ever seen."
The Laburist party no longer tolerates people with a different view.
People who express their opinion are no longer tolerated
It didn't surprise me that Momentum activists from my local party supported the motion of censorship in my case.
As a result, I am only one of the members of the Laburist Party of Parliament who said they were not welcome, just because we expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, received a similar treatment because he was very strict with regard to anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, the motion of censorship was critical to my address because I didn't agree with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
With regard to the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar problems, ironically referring to which Jeremy had no common opinion with previous leaders.
The Communication for the Meeting of the Nottingham East of the Laburist Party states that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of the eight-year term as a member of Parliament for the Laburist Party, the GC meetings of the evening were like this.
Unfortunately, many of today's sittings do not take place in this way, and the promise of a "better, healthier" political environment has been forgotten for a long time if it has ever been respected.
It has become more evident that the different opinions are not tolerated in the Laburist Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of what is accepted by the party's conduct.
Things began to be this way when Jeremy became leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom I had a common view of politics began to expect me to change my way of thinking and to agree with some things I would not have previously agreed with, namely national security or the single market in the EU.
Every time I speak in public, regardless of what I say, it follows a wave of abuses on the destabilization networks that call for my removal from the party, accusing central policy, telling me that I should not be in the Laburist Party.
And I'm not the only person who's faced with this thing.
In fact, I know I'm happier than my colleagues, because comments about my person tend to be political.
I am impressed by professionalism and the determination that gives proof to my colleagues who face sexual or racist abuse, but I keep their level of involvement in this sense.
One of the most disturbing aspects of this political era is the fact that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Laburist Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different points of view within the party, and with each motive of censorship or change of the selection rules, the party becomes less flexible in this respect.
Many people have urged me in the last two years to put my head down, not to be so vocal, and everything "will be fine" like that.
But that's not why I got involved in politics.
Since I joined the Laburist Party 32 years ago, when I was a student, I was moved by the fact that the lack of care given to the government of Thatcher has led to my class's improvisation, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who need them most, as local councillor or minister.
I've never hidden my political opinions, including the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East can say that my views on politics and issues that are not agreed with the current leadership are unclear.
People who have supported the movement of Friday can only say that, in the context where the country is headed to Brexit, what will affect our local economies, businesses and services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Laburist Party.
But the only message I want to deliver is not for the Momentum group in Nottingham, but for citizens whether or not they are members of the Laburist Party: I am proud to represent you and I promise you that no threat of elimination from the party or political opportunity will stop me from making the decisions that I consider to be in your best interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr football team reaches the top of the classics
Despite the fact that two recent attempts have influenced a kind of final outcome, there is no doubt about the fact that Ayr deserves to win the extremely interactive game today from Tennent's Premiership.
It's now in the top of the class, being the only team without any break in the ten.
In the end, everything was summarized in their best defense, as well as in the fact that they took advantage of the chances that appeared, which helped the gas team and thanked coach Peter Murchie.
"We have been subjected to more tests on the course of our games until now and we continue to be innocent, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "The Merits agree with the Ayr team, they have benefited from more than us."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute trial, transformed by Frazier Climo, gave him an advantage to the Ayr team, but a Galben cartoon received by Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the team, this playing at the Warriors, allowed the Melrose team to change the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of an untransformatted attempt.
Climo got a penalty for Ayr and, even at the half of the game, managed to sign up, and then he managed to convert an individual trial, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr in a break.
But Melrose started his second rehearsal very well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, translated by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The game was suspended for a few minutes because of Ruaridh Knott's serious injury, which had been pulled out of the field with targa, and since the game was re-started, Ayr has been detached through the attempt of player Stafford McDowell, transformed from Climo.
Captain Ayr's team, Blair Macpherson then received a yellow cardboard and again, the Merrose team made him pay for an untransformatted attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of a completed pressure.
However, the gas team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a gallonous cardboard because he liked Climo without menopause, MacPherson managed to march, offering the Ayr team's advantage.
Climo transformed the test, as he did again almost at the beginning of the game, after Kyle Rowe executed a "box kick" movement and sent Gregor Henry's extreme in depth for the fifth attempt of the team.
The "Still Game" site view looks ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the website “Still Game”, seems ready to move into the hospital industry after he found out that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The man, at the age of 56, plays Jack Jarvis' role in the BBC's favorite show, writing his scenario and playing with his long-term partner, Greg Hemphil's comedy actor.
The two announced that the next series, the new number, will be the last, and Kieman seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the information provided in the official register, this is the Director of the Affonorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this knowledge, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan would be involved in the "in the development industry of restaurants".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia Island hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
The mariners patrol a ship's seat full of macarals in La Paz.
Public buildings burn the white-colored steacle, like the ocean.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with the motto: "The sea is our right.
We have to get it back."
Along Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, the memory of a lost coast in Chile in a bloody conflict of the resources of the 19th century is still alive – just as the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are likely to be at the highest level in the past decade, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the necessary advantage, a spirit of unity and maturity and, of course, looks forward to the outcome with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will make a decision in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of firm discussions, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign exit to the sea, Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia – who faces a controversial fight for the re-election of the next year – also has many winners since the month's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts think it's less likely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and that it would change too little if it happened.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no power to agree on the territory belonging to Chile and has provided that it will not determine the outcome of the possible discussions.
The fact that the ICJ decision comes only six months after the final pleas have been heard indicates that this case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert at international law.
And not only that Bolivia did not succeed, but it's possible that the last four years have given it back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been interrupted by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' bleging retort weakened any Chilean residency, suggested it.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at a given time, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not replaced Ambassadors since 1962.
The former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in the Hague, rejected the idea that the decision-making process of the court was rapidly under way.
The Monday day will bring Bolivia "a wonderful opportunity to open up a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "complete the 139 years of mutual disagreement with each other," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – another of the most beloved presidents of Latin America – used maritime problem as a political support.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to go through the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place if it cannot be trusted in the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, said his country would never fire its nuclear weapons if it couldn't trust Washington.
We talked about this Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to respect the promises made during a Singapore summit with the leaders of rivals.
His comments came in the context of which US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the point of relaunching diplomatic actions on nuclear threat three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
He stated that it is a 'real vision' such as the continued sanctions and the United States' object of the declaration concerning the end of the Korean war to make the territory of the north ever surrender.
Washington has reticences to agree with the statement without the Phenian taking significant disarmament measures first.
Both Kim and the presidents of the United States, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there are a lot of exceptions that don't think that the Phoenician has a serious intention to give up the arsenal that the country considers the only way to ensure security.
Pompeo intends to visit the Phenian next month to prepare a second Kim-Trup summit.
A fashion presentation from Paris presents the latest trends in hairstyles and will be available in magazines soon
If you are looking for hair to extend your collection or protect you completely from the sun, you must no longer search.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne searched for participants in the Paris Fashion Week, launching a series of oversized and extraordinary haircuts for their spring-war 2019 collection.
The practical walls have conquered the Instagram platform in this summer, and fashion makers have sent the creatures that steal their eyes from the podium.
The building resistance square, made by Valentino, was an extravagance, colour-colored hat with a large bar, similar to a pen, in which the heads of models were raised.
Other oversized accessors have included marbled stones, a verdant hat and even a pineapple, but they are not created to protect your head against cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange measures at the time for Halloween.
Many of the colored mats had costumes and brought more to the special accessor of Hannibal Lecter, and did not wear tight shoes.
One of the creatures seemed to be a sculptor equipment, having a oxygen tube and glasses, while the other seemed to be a frozen child.
And if you want to continue to adopt such a style of dress, with oversized clothing articles, you're lucky.
The Stylers prefer a return of huge bottles in luxury fashion stores.
The super-sized walls are reminiscent of the "La Bomba", a large-scale football club, seen all over the world from Rihanna and to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the partly practical flag which appeared on all socializing networks caused the appearance of another oversized creature on the podium, respectively, of beach species, with a size as large as the model in the cost of bathing as a port.
La Riviera's "La Riviera" of Jacquemus's Week of Fashion from Paris
The visualist Luke Armitage said to the FC: "I expect to see hair and beach people oversized in the luxury stores next summer, because the fashion creator had such a strong impact that it will be difficult to ignore the request for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills, essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have a record of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results for the examination, which is supported by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 students from Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scotian Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are seeking to provide services to their students and parents at the highest level.
Independent schools propose to prepare students for higher and higher education, their choice career and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will reach his mind.
If you speak in his own language, the words will reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
On the basis of the recent results of this year's competition, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the classrooms, with the biggest promotion rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have studied foreign languages have obtained a Higher degree A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students had obtained a High Grade A certificate in Mandarin; 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish received such a certificate.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Now, foreign languages, like matter, tend to be like STEM subjects (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curriculums and other fields.
A survey carried out by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that, for the reasons that employers gave them for the fight against the occupation of vacations, 17% were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Thus, more and more, language skills become imperative for preparing young people for their future career.
With more opportunities for jobs that require foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such skills throughout life.
The ability to communicate directly to people from foreign countries will automatically place a multilingual person before the competition.
According to a poll made by YouGov over 4,000 adults from the British Sea in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and the French language was the only language spoken by two percent, 15%.
Therefore, investment in learning foreign languages is important for children today.
With more languages, especially in developing countries, children will be more likely to find significant jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach other foreign languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interest, there will always be more languages of choice within independent schools, with educational frameworks that are specialized in this area.
Independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of their future.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so that this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered as "International communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it well (Trebuie made).

LeBron will do the launch at Lakers Sunday in San Diego.
The waiting is almost over for the fans who want to see LeBron James as he starts for Los Angeles Lakers.
The coach of the Lakers team, Luke Walton, announced that James will play in the opening of Sunday's detention against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
But how many minutes he'll play still to set.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, wrote on Twitter that James will probably play limited minutes.
Following the training from the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers program of six games in the press.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need to play in prison to prepare myself," he said.
Time of Trup's electoral meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five rounds of Trump programmed next week, which includes stops in places where the electorate is in favour, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote for the candidate for his election for the Supreme Court's free place is suspended temporarily, Trump wishes to consolidate support for future elections by means of the mandate because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress after the vote in November.
In what hour will Trump's election meeting be held in West Virginia last night and where can I follow him online?
Trump's mix from Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00, East Coast time, Sunday, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trup's electoral match from West Virginia through the live video stream below on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, hearing that has become tense because of sexual misconduct charges, while the pending confirmation vote of the Senate is suspended for a week so that the FBI can investigate the charges.
But the main objective of this series of myths is to help the Republicans, who face tough elections in November, win a bit of land.
Thus, President Trump's campaign stated that the role of these five rounds next week is "to empower the volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority held in the Senate and in the Chamber of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control over the Congress is so important for its programme that the president will travel to as many countries as possible before entering the very agglomerated campaign season," said Reuters a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who did not want to be named.
Scheduled to take place in Wesbanco Arena from Wheeling, the meeting this evening could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be presented in the media in Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump visits Virginia of West, the state in which he won the elections at a 40 percent difference in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who's in the polls.
"The fact that the president came to try to promote him in the polls is not a good sign for Morrisey," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Cupa Ryder 2018: US team gives evidence of determination and continues to fight to keep the chance for simple samples that start Sunday
After three clearly dominated sessions, it is possible that the week-to-morrow test was exactly what Cupa Ryder needed.
The always oscillating pendulum of motivation is a concept invented for the sports world, but players really believe in it, with so much more in the case of competitions like this.
So, where's their motive now?
"They led us with six points, now the difference is only four points, so we are based on this drop for a little reason," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point advance, when there are still twelve points in the game.
Americans, say Spieth, feel that the game begins to change in favor of them and that there are some reasons for encouragement, among which is the most important form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and have won every three of the four points.
Spieth sent meles to the green area with a lethal precision, being an example for his colleagues.
Those Christmas candles became even more exhilarating on the scale of progress, especially when he wrote a crucial point by which he re-established the score in the fourth match, after he and Thomas were driven by two points after the first two holes.
The fight that won the game at 15 was celebrated with a similar watch, a watch that makes you think the American team still has chances.
"You just have to concentrate and worry about your own game," Spieth says.
That's how these players left them.
18 guys to leave a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but worshipful couple of Europe won four games and it seems that I can't make a mistake.
"Molywood" was the only reason they didn't need any extra hit next Saturday afternoon, but this statement is valid also for Saturday morning, and for Friday afternoon, even for the new points of Friday morning.
This performance and the way their energy seems to go about and inside the enthusiastic audience reinforces the idea that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if this would lead to a potential victory of Europeans when the sun will rise over Le Golf National.
It's preferable, both at the same time, to different tires.
The debate on the glory of the Europeans remains too late.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson passed by Sergio Garcia, the morning hero at the Fourballs trial, when he made a joke with Alex Noren.
A further beating and two doubles at the first nine geese laid their hands on the Spaniard and Sweden in a cave so deep that they were not even close to getting out of it.
Sunday, however, no one will be safe.
The samples of furballs and fursoms are fascinating and worthy of almost due to interactions between birds, data and data advice and the way a strategy can be modified.
Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage in the final day, but this feed session has also shown that the US team has the motivation to continue the fight, which some, especially those in the United States, have doubted.
Europe leads with 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will start the last day of Cupa Ryder with a significant advantage after it has closed the football games and Saturdays with a 10-6 advantage in front of the United States.
The inspiration composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offensive with two winners in front of an amazing Tiger Woods, which has increased their score so far to Le Golf National at four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to recover the trophies he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated American players who made a lot of mistakes in the morning's football test and won the series with score 3 to 1.
THE US opposed a more serious resistance to the fursome test, where it won two matches, but it could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from the 12 simple Sunday games to keep the trophi.
Fleetwood is the first European news to win four rounds, and together with Molinari, a top-named "Molliwood" after a sensory weekend, are the second to win four points from the four opening games throughout the history of Cupe Ryder.
After they threw Woods and Patrick Reed into the fireballs test, they were superseded to break down the Woods detachment and American newsman Bryson Dechambeau with a very clear score, 5-4.
Woods, who had problems in the two Saturdays, had occasional genotypes, but so far, 19 of the 29 football matches and foursomes, of which seven were consecutive burns.
Justin Rose, who retired during the morning's fourballs session, returned with partner Henrik Stenson in a foursome test and faced him with 2-1 on Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, positions one and three in the world.
Europe, however, did not have a course without obstacles on this pleasant and rich day in the south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, a triple winner of major tournaments, and Justin Thomas became the final for the Americans, winning two Saturdays.
They managed to win with 2-1 a match against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the field of furballs, then they returned later and faced Poulter and Rory McIllroy with 4 to 3 in the game, after they lost the first two games.
Just twice in the history of Cupe Ryder managed a team to recover a deficit of four points in simple samples, though, because they are the current holders of the trophie, Furyk's players just need an equal result.
However, after the second two days on the border, a Sunday contract seems unlikely.
North Korea says there is no "no chance" to disarm unilaterally as long as there is no confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister said on Saturday to the United Nations that the extension of sanctions would deepen the lack of confidence in the United States and that it is impossible for his country to abandon its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho announced the annual General Assembly of the Global Council that "significant measures to prove good faith" have been implemented in North Korea last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and testing rockets, detonating nuclear testing sites and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we see no appropriate answer from the US party," he said.
"If we can't trust the US, we won't trust our national security capabilities and, in such circumstances, we can't defeat the first unilaterally."
Although Ri rejected North Korea's family objectives about the resistance of Washington to a "exhaustible" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps, its statement seemed significant because it did not directly reject unilateral denuclearization, as it had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during a summit between a U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim committed to making progress towards a "nuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump provided security assurances for North Korea.
North Korea has sought an official end of the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has stated that the Phenian must first abandon his nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington did not apply for relief from international heavy sanctions imposed by North Korea.
"The EU insists on the option "first denuclearization" and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its objective in a coherent manner, because it even aims against "the declaration of the end of the war", Ri said.
"The impression that the sanctions can single us is an illusion that only people who don't know us.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our lack of confidence."
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump referred to by US leader to the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, South Korean President for the last five months, adding: "If the problem of denuclearization had been negotiated with South Korea and not with the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have taken place in this stage."
Even under these circumstances, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from that of last year's speech, when he declared to the United Nations General Assembly that it is inevitable to hold the US territory with rockets from North Korea after "Mr. Malefic" Trump called Kim a "mike" in a sinuous mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, which threatened North Korea last year with "the total destruction", urged Kim to start the disarmament process, but it stated that the work was just beginning and that the sanctions would remain valid until North Korea was denuclearized.
Wednesday, Trump stated that there is no planned period for this and added: "It doesn't matter if it lasts two or three years or five months."
China and Russia say that the Phenean should be paid by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: "The application of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be ongoing and without interruption until we have complete, final and confirmed decolonization."
The Security Council unanimously increased the sanctions imposed by North Korea beginning in 2006, in an attempt to block funds for nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles of the Phinenus.
Pompeo met with Ri on the colors of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit again the following month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit didn't have any good results.
When he left Phoean in July, he said that progress had been made, but after just a few hours, North Korea reported that it had done "gasteristic threats".
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to demounting a missile launch framework and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "responsive measures".
This said Kim told her that the "relevant measures" they were looking for were the security guarantees Trump promised to Singapore and that he wanted to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses on how to relax enough
A new class from Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to fight the "macho" culture in growth that makes it possible to hold all night learning sessions with a lot of caffeine.
A man of science discovered that, again, students of the most prestigious universities in the world do not even master the basic concepts of the way they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of this type of U.S.
This was inspired to create the course after holding a conference on the impact of the lack of sleep on learning ability.
"At the end, a girl came and said to me, "Why is this saying to me right now, last year?"
She told me she never talked to her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she said for The Telegraph.
The course, introduced earlier this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance, as well as general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were seriously out of sleep during the week.
The course that lasts an hour may involve a series of interactive tasks.
In a section, the picture of a room is presented, and students can click on coffee dogs, losings, sports pants and cards to tell them that the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance are affected by sleeplessness, but also about the importance of a sleep program.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive pictograms, encourages participants to think about their daily program.
"We know we can't change the student behaviour immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as everyone has the right to know the effects of smoking on health," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that makes students proud to learn all night is still there, says it, adding that modern technology and pressure imposed on students have transformed sleep privacy into a growing problem.
The dream, of a good quality, should be a "secret weapon" of a student to combat stress, bullying and anxiety, said it, even to avoid weight gain, because the vision makes the brain believe that the body is formed, which makes students feel that they are constantly starving.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create the course, after participating in one of his courses in his first year at Harvard.
That said that the course opened her eyes and inspired her to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all post-university students to complete a similar study programme before joining this institution where the competition is near.
Professor Czeisler advised students to schedule an alarm to know when it is time to sleep, as well as for hours of wake-up, and to know that the adverse effects of the "white light" are emitted by electronic and LED screens, which may cause the circadian rhythm and cause difficulties when they try to approve.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's gol dowser team Gerrard's
Rangers suffers from another case of depression in the move because Dolly Menga's strike condemned Steven Gerrard's unconventional team at a 1-0 strike in Livingston.
Ibrox's team wanted to get the first victory to move from the triumph with 4--1 won in February against St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team managed to administer Gerard's second 18-game rank as coach, which puts Rangers with eight points behind Hearts, the leader of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga signed seven minutes before the break and the non-inspired players from Rangers did not appear in any moment to be equal.
Rangers fell so on the sixth position in class, while Livingston pushed on third place, behind the Hibernian, to a difference of one goal.
And Rangers could also face other problems, because the Calum Spence tube archipelago had to be treated for a wound at the head level after an object was, it seems, thrown into the side of the visiting team's fans.
Gerard changed eight players from the ball that won easy against Ayr in the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 players from Livingstone who managed to get a match with Hearts last week and has all the reasons for being proud of the way his ball was well-instructed and facing opponents during the game.
Even if Rangers had a superior position, Livingston used the irons they had.
It should have gone only two minutes after the game started, when Menga's first step proposed Scott Pittman to the defense gate by Allan McGregor, but the middleman missed a very good opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs' deep free fight found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgov, sent him to the bar.
Rangers took control, but they left the impression that they hoped more than they trusted in their game in the last three games.
Alfredo Morelos sincerely believed that he should have received a sentence when he had sex with Steven Lawless in the fifteenth minute of the game, but the judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian request.
Rangers had only two hits on the front door, but the former porter from Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was not quite disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly's head or Ovie Ejaria's weak hit.
Although the 34-minute golfer from Livingstone did not respect the trend of the game, no one can deny that it was deserved, either for the effort to surrender.
Again, Rangers couldn't prevent Jacobs' deep center.
Scott Arfield had no response when Declan Gallagher sent Scott Robinson's honey, who kept calm and passed on Menga, who ended up with a simple beating.
Gerrard acted on the break when he replaced Ryan Kent with Coulibaly; this move almost gave him a second when the extreme centered on Morelos, but the impressionant Kelly went out of the boots to block him.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors exactly the same type of game that he prefers, with Lithgov and Halkett who intercepted centers after the center.
Holt's team could have extended the advantage in the final phase, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs' strike, and then Lithgow sent his head to the corner of the neck beating.
Glenn Middleton, booked at Rangers, asked for a penalty at the end of the game when he hit Jacobs, but again, Thomson didn't agree.
Almanah: the engineer of the Geiger accountant
And now, a page from our Almanahul Monday morning: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago (and the count of CONTINUE...), is the day when, in Germany, the physical future of John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that led to the creation of the device known as Geiger account.
An essential provision for science since then, the Geiger account has become essential for pop culture, as in the movie "Clopotes of San Coronado" (1950), in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played in the role of cowboys with unlikely science trends:
The man said, "What else is this?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger account used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these helmets, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted from radioactive activity in the minerals."
Evans said: "Yes, a lot of people hear."
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before he was 63 years old.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" night cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" the harmful cells and destroy them.
As part of treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the harmful cells
Method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, their transformation into a laboratory
These can "detect" a common protein for many cancers and then reinject
A test vaccine provides promising results for patients with a cancer range.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize nighttime cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting the immune cells from a patient, changing them into a laboratory in such a way that it can detect a common protein called HER2, then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Oncology in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest we have to do it with a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "determines the growth of more cancers", including blood, ovarians, pulmonary and colorectals, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, to remove the immune cells from patients and to “learn” them to test cancer cells, has also worked for the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West held a stand-up diary for Trump while wearing a MAGA hat, after the SNL appearance.
He didn't get out too well.
Kanye West was invited to the studio during the Saturday Night Live event after a disillusioned show in which he welcomed US President Donald Trump and said he intends to apply for the 2020 elections.
After interpreting the third song, Ghost Town, during which he wore a German Make America Great, the artist went away in a speech against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
"Many times when I talk to a white person, I'm asked, "How can you like Trump? He's racist."
Well, if I'd been worried about racism, I'd have been moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a scene in which Matt Damon played, where Hollywood stared at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee on sexual assault charges made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's cartoon film was loaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock's trying to get him over to the West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that she had problems in the streets because of her husband.
"I tried to scare me in the streets.
They said to me, "Don't go out wearing this hat."
I've been attacked!
They told me we got very low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how far I've gone?" then he said, "I'll take Superman's mansion, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try with love."
His comments drew Jews from the public at least twice, and SNL team members appeared to be crazy, reported Variety; a person in this team said to the publication: "In the study there was a complete silence."
West was invited as a replacement for the last hour for soloist Ariana Grande, whom he was loved, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West raised a lot of springs when he interpreted the song I Love it dressed as a Perrier glass.
West was supported by the leader of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the bravest spirits among us: YOU'RE NOT GLOATED."
Karen Hunter, the husband of a talk show, wrote on Twitter that the West was just, "it was himself and that's wonderful."
"I choose not to reward anyone (by buying music or clothing or by supporting art) who I think is wearing and expressing a nocturnal ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Before the issue, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, declaring that from now on it is "the officially known village of Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name; West clicks on Diddy's back, previously known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former legend of music, Prince, changed his name into a symbol and then into "the artist known as Prince's right".
Adjudication of attempted murder for an incarceration in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after another man was injected into a restaurant in eastern Belfast, Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, said the police.
The defence lawyer is waiting months in front of the Belfast Court.
The allegations will be examined by the Public Prosecutor.
Kit Harington, the star of the thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for Jon Snow's role in the violent media fantasy series of violent Tronzeals, produced by HBO.
But 31-year-old actor attacked male hero stereotypes, saying that presenting these roles on the screen makes boys think they should be hard to be respected.
In an interview for The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said it seems to her that "something went wrong" and asked how the problem of toxic masculinity could be handled in the era #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his colleague at the Tournament Office, Rose Leslie, aged 31, admitted that she is "very determined" to talk about this problem.
"Personal, I am very determined to talk about this now: where have I been wrong with masculinity?" he asked.
"What have I taught men about how to be adults, given the problem we are facing now?"
Kit believes that television could be a part of the responsibility for the growth of toxic masculinity through very male characters.
He continued: “What has he been born, and what has he been taught?
What does a young man learn from TV and street, what makes him think he should be some kind of man?
I think this is one of the great questions of our times: how can we change this?
'Cause it's clear that something went wrong with young people."
In the interview, he acknowledged that he would not play in any kind of series based on the Urzeal of the Thrones after the series ends in the spring of next year, saying that "he ended with war camps and horses".
In November, Kit will play in a new production of the True West theatre of Sam Shepard, which presents the story of a film producer and his brother, who is tender.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened to her because of the series of the Thrones is that she met her wife, Rose.
"I met my wife when I made this series, so it gave me the future of my family and my life before," said Kit.
Rose played in Ygritte's role, loved by Jon Snow, the character played by Kit in the winning fantasy series of Emmy's most prizes.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in the number of new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this disease in China, the officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted on sexual grounds, especially in the past.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced close to zero, says Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
From one year to another, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community of China.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered very widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who engage in sex with other men will eventually get married to a woman.
Many cases of transmission of diseases stem from inadequate sexual protection measures in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV medicines, as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has disclosed the data of senators of the Republican Party, talks about "hazardous minorities" and "conspiracy theories"
The representative of Maxine Waters filed Saturday charges under which a member of his team posted personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat of Los Angeles claimed that the charges are made by analysts and websites of "extreme right".
"Millions, lies and other horrible lies," Waters said in a post on Twitter.
The information disclosed included the addresses and personal phone numbers of the senators. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Tuesday, posted by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a hearing in the Senate on sexual misconduct charges against Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as Judge at the Supreme Court.
The leaking of information took place shortly after the three senators addressed Kavanaugh's questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of posts was associated with Waters' office and provided information to a member of the Waters team, reports Hill.
"These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of the team whose identity, personal information and security were committed as a result of these false accusations was not in any way responsible for the falsification of these information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie."
Waters' statements were criticised online shortly after they were made, including the former secretary for the press of the Albe House, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that he does not have the necessary temperature to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, he doesn't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be challenging.
It should not be subject to the question of the motive of the accused.
It has to be calm and quiet."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Judge Kavanaugh, criticised by Democrats, who said he seemed a little too angry during the hearing of March.
Omar Navarro, the Republican who is candidate against Waters in the mid-term elections, also commented on the situation on Twitter.
"It's important, if it's true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said her office warned "the appropriate legal authorities and entities about these false accusations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be discovered," she continued, "and that they will respond to the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any member of my team."
Johnny English Rehearsals Rehearsals: Parody without the desire of spy movies, with Rowan Atkinson in the main role
It has become a tradition to look for the meanings associated with Brexit in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new film from the series of action films that has it as its main character in the English language, which started with Johnny English in 2003 and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English.
Will this exciting satisfaction of how strange we are to become the new opportunity to export the nation?
Anyway, Johnny English, the incompetent spy with the naked eyes and face, was renewed for the second time the license to strike everything. The name of the person means, firstly, that it is a general comical creation for the cinematographic public in the developing English-language countries.
He is, of course, the secret agent who, despite his claims for luxury and extravagance, has a bit of Clouseau, a picture of Mr. Bean and a poem from the guy who contributed with a single note on the music theme of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony from London.
The person is based on the explorer and the mysterious man without a country that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's TV ads, which left chaos behind him.
This last adventure of JJ has one or two lovely moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached an helicopter dressed in an environmental armory and the rotor's wings hit his coat easily.
The cost of Atkinson's physical comedy is highlighted, but the mood is quite weak and, surprisingly, superfluous, especially because the films "serious", such as the 007 series or the impossible mission, offer with confidence comets as ingredients.
The murder seems to be more to children than adults and, for me, Johnny's wonderful adventures of English are not as adventures and smart as Atkinson's moving movie gurus when playing in Bean's role.
As usual, the prize is always that Great Britain has serious problems.
A cyber hacker has invested in the UK's supersecret spy website and has revealed the identity of English agents under cover, to the disappointment of the service agent, a sad role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last picture for a prime minister pompos and undersea, who already suffers a serious crisis due to the drop in political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything he can with his similar character Theresei May, but the scenario doesn't give him a chance to shine.
Its consultants in the field of confidential information shall inform it that all active spies have been compromised, so that an agent found in the reserve must be activated.
This is itself Johnny English's draw, now working as a teacher in a high school, which also gives lessons about how to be an employee undercover. Here are some nice guys, because English runs a school of spy in the School of Rock style.
English is brought back to Whitehall, for an emergency seat, then it's together with his weather partner, Bugh, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and valuable character, the role of Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a little frustrated.
So, these Batman and Robin have created scholarships in the Secret Service of His Majesty, they return to action to meet the beautiful dead woman Ophelia Bulletova, interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister falls in the truth of a billion-dollar charismatic technological industry that claims to be able to solve the IT problems of the British Mary: the Jason Volta nurse, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough take a look at the bourgeois adventures: Deprived in the cellars, I fire a French restaurant in fashion, create chaos when they cross Volta's luxury boat, then English decants anarchy in the form when they try to use a set of glasses for virtual reality to familiarize themselves with the inner house of Volta.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but regardless of whether it is a beautiful and colorful film, it seems to be a television production for children.
A movie that's kind of mediocre.
As in other movies with Johnny English, I can't stop asking myself: can't even the British cinema industry give Rowan Atkinson a role as his talent?
The workers deny they're planning to work four days a week, but they're paying for five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Laburist party would have a radical plan, according to which the British would work only four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
It appears that the party wants the heads of companies to benefit from the possible economies due to the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) while giving employees another day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the salary would not have been changed.
The sources say that the idea would be "opportunity" with the party's economic programme, which wants to close the balance in favour of the workers.
The four-day work week is supported by the Trade Union Congress in a way that workers can benefit from the change in the economy.
A source from the leadership of the Laburist Party stated for The Sunday Times: “The announcement of a policy review is expected before the end of the year.
It will not happen during the night, but a four-day working week is an appropriate ambition for the economic re-balance party in favour of the employer as well as in the overall industry strategy."
The Laburist Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day working week was one of the Green Party promises in the 2017 campaign for general elections.
However, this ambition is not supported by the entire Laburist Party.
A spokesman for the Laburist Party stated: "The four-day work week is not a party policy and is not taken into account."
John McDonnell, Chancellor of the Umbrella Cabinet, took advantage of last week's lab conference to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell stated that it was decided to take back the power from "indirectors without face" and "professionals" from the utility companies.
The plans of the Governor of the chamber of Umbrella also refer to the fact that the current shareholders of the water supply regions may not recover their shares in the whole, because the Labour Government could perceive "deductions" due to some of the offences identified.
It has also confirmed the plans to appoint employees in company management councils and to create property funds through which it allocates up to 10% of the private sector's own capital to employees, which will receive such an annual dividend up to about 500 litres.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal in the "60 Minutes" show if Kavanaugh's investigation by the FBI would make him reflect
An investigation by the FBI of the charges brought by Judge Brett Kavanaugh has raised the final vote on his application as a judge in the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the Republican senators could be convinced that he could no longer support him because of the FBI findings.
In a broadcast interview on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make him reflect.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said this from the beginning of the hearings; I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges appeared, and I asked him, "Are you guilty?"
The answer was decided, immediately, without fault."
Graham's vote, however, seems to be on the wall.
"I am determined with regard to Brett Kavanaugh, so there would be some explosive charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett rejects the charges," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
‘None of the persons designated by it has confirmed the report.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt that something will change."
What is the Global Citizens' Festival and managed to do something to reduce poverty?
This week, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that will be attended by an impressive group of stars, with a mission like that: the elimination of world poverty.
In addition to the seventh edition, the Global Citizens' Festival will attract tens of thousands of people on the Central Park platform, not only to follow artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the true fate of the event, eliminating extreme poverty until 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of lawyers hoping to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to receive an event free ticket (except where they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the viewers had to buy from a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to world leaders, making phone calls or other significant things that would help to raise awareness of the level of global poverty eradication.
But what happened when I was only 12 years old to reach the goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert a good way to convince them to act or is it just another case called "clictivism", a concept that refers to people who feel that they have done something by signing an online request or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, more than 19 million "actions" have been registered in 2011 from its supporters, which have promoted different objectives.
The organization says that these actions have inspired world leaders to announce commitments and policies with a value of more than $37 billion, which will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group spoke of 390 commitments and ads resulting from its actions, with at least $10 billion already being spent or stopped.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership with the British Sea of investors and intermediaries who have committed themselves to "help children grow up to their full potential", which he promised to offer Rwanda $35 million to contribute to the eradication of malnutrition in the country, after they received more than 4700 messages on Twitter from all over the world.
"With the help of the British government, the donors, the national governments and other global citizens like you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition just a footnote in the history book," said Tracey Ulman, Ambassador The Power of Nutrition, in front of many during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions were carried out in the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it will finance the project The Power of Nutrition, which will ensure nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most frequent questions on their website: "What makes you believe you can eliminate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: “There will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will fall and make mistakes.
But, like the great movements of civil rights or anti-partid rights that have taken place before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae is among the artists who will sing this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the shipping forces for a "block" to collect Russia's energy exports, the Secretary of the Interior said
Washington may, "if necessary", appeal to the shipping forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including in the Middle East, revealed US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's commitment to Syria, in particular where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why I am in the Middle East is that I want to intervene in energy sales, as I do in Eastern Europe and in southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means of managing the situation.
"The United States has the ability, through our ship's forces, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to create a block, so that energy does not come into the market," he said.
Zinke is addressing participants to an event created by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that declares "the voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
This continued by comparing how Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is practically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the use and replacement of fuels," he said, saying about Russia that "he knows a single trick" because of the fossil fuel-dependent economy.
Statements came at a time when the Trump administration was trying to increase exports of natural gas in Europe to replace Russia with a much more cheap option for European consumers.
In this sense, the representatives of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" project of the North Stream 2 gas pipeline, which, according to Trump, would transform Berlin into a "prison" in Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly highlighted the fact that the 11 billion-dollar project of North Stream 2, which will double the current management capacity of 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin stated that the fierce opposition of the US towards the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that with regard to the same things: energy cannot be a pressure instrument and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Aleksandr Novak, Russia's energy minister after a meeting with Rick Perry, U.S. Energy Secretary in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted critics from Germany, who reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
The main industrial organisation of Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with the fact that a third state intervenes in matters of our energy," said Dieter Kempp, president of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "thinks Seriously" to apply to the 2020 presidential elections, says Senator of Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, said Saturday that he must "think seriously" if he can apply to the presidential elections after the mid-term elections.
At the first meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidate.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and restore our strict government, and that's why a strong woman needs it," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously think if I can apply to the presidential elections."
Warren had something to say about President Donald Trump during the spring meeting, saying that it "corrected the country in a wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was a very vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, its candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a post on Twitter Friday, Warren said "normally we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll published today showed that no majority of Warren's voters think they should apply in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" votes in Massachusetts said that the senator should not apply, according to a poll conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such a candidate.
The Sunday showed more support for a candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support a potential candidate and 48% are against.
Other names of well-known democracies that could be nominated in 2020 are those of Vice-President Joe Biden and of Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
Biden said he will decide officially until January, reports Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the posttraumatic stress syndrome that suffers from Track Palin at a meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after he called in September.
Last night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
"The things that my own son, who has gone through since he came back... can understand the suffering of other families who feel the ramifications of posttraumatic stress syndrome and the consequences of the injuries our soldiers return to," said the audience gathered at a demonstration of support from Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this "the elephant of the camp" and said that her son and other war veterans "will return a little different, harder, wondering if there is more respect for what they and their troops from the armed forces and aircraft, as well as all the other members of the Army, have done for the country."
This was arrested last month in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of a domestic violence act and the possession of a fire weapon in Hebrew, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman of the Department of Police in Wasilla.
18 States and the Columbia District are answering a new asylum request policy
Eightty States and the Columbia District support a legal challenge to the new US policies that refuse to grant asylum to victims who are trying to escape from the violence caused by finders or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts have completed a request for a friend's visit tomorrow in Washington to support a policy challenge on asylum seekers, reports NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions process that the American Civil Liberties Union organisation launched in August against federal policy was not revealed.
She said her partner "his violent, gang members" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
The State-appointed lawyer representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produced a large number of asylum seekers in the USA, right to nations facing a generalized problem with housing and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has rejected a 2014 Council Decision on Immigration Appeals that has allowed immigrants to escape from domestic violence to seek asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy "ignores the decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"The federal law says that all asylum applications must be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a limitation imposes this principle," writes a friend Kuriae's application.
In addition, lawyers argue that the policy refusing to enter immigrants affects the US economy, saying it is more likely that it will become entrepreneurs and "give the necessary labour force".
Jeff Sessions, the U.S. Attorney General, ordered judges in June for immigration cases to no longer agree with victims who are trying to escape abuse and violence in their homes.
"Azil is welcomed by those who leave their country under persecution or fear because of discrimination based on race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or because of a political opinion," said Sessions on 11 June, when it announced politics.
The role of asylum was never that of solving all the problems facing people in the world every day, or even all the serious problems.
Save operations expected in Palu, where the number of deaths has doubled, in a race against the chronicler to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become even worse.
"The situation seems very tense," said Risa Kusumuma, a 35-year-old mother, who joins her baby in suffering from February at an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"The ambulances bring bodies all the time.
The water is not enough."
Residents have begun to return to their destroyed homes and organize their wells, trying to save everything that can be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by the magnitude 7.5 on Richter scale were overstated.
Some of the wounds, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures in the vertebral column and in the umbrella, rest outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients are treated in free air due to strong and continuous relapsions.
This has eyes full of tears when he remembers how he felt his violent nightmare breaking the hotel room from the fifth floor where he shared it with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was caught in the ruins of the wall, I think," said Haris for Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, then just quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope I'm safe."
US Ambassador accuses China "abuses" of "propagand advertising"
A week after an official newspaper in China published a four-page announcement in a US daily that praised the mutual benefits of trade exchanges between the US and China, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to distribute propaganda material.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the extra payments paid by China in Des Moines Register, the best selling newspaper in Iowa, after he accused China of joining the 6 November elections for Congress, a charge China rejects.
The statement that Beijing is trying to join the US elections marked what U.S. officials have declared to Reuters that it is a new phase in a Washington scaling campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish complaints that promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently blocked in a growing trade war, which involves price increases for imports.
The prices imposed by China as a dispute, at the beginning of the trade war, were created to affect exporting countries such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, said experts from China and the US.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and was governor in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and business people.
In a Sunday edition published in Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China "continues this abuse by publishing advertisements in our own press".
"When spreading propaganda by publishing a statement in Des Moines Register, the Chinese government does not respect the tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of expression in America," says Branstad.
"In exchange, on the streets of Beijing, you will find a few voices of the dissidents and you will not see any real reflection of the varied views that Chinese citizens have about the worrying economic tragedy of China, considering that mass media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say what paper is.
The Republican aligns women's votes before the elections from the middle of the mandate due to the Kavanaugh scandal, warns analysts
Because many of the top Republicans support and protect Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, of more sexual abuse charges, analysts have warned that there will be a confrontation, especially among women, during the upcoming elections from half the mandate.
The emotions created by this scandal were extremely strong, and most of the Republicans who have discussed this publicly intend to continue the vote.
"These reactions will not be forgotten," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, for The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's recent initiative on an FBI investigation will calm the angry electorate.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, will not forget tomorrow and will not forget in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and spokesman for the national group's progress report, said Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors scand "november wine!" while they showed up on the Senate halls when the Republicans who control the judicial committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination process in spite of the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, told Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of democracies will be very great," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-participating political analyst for the news site.
"People say they were already very big and that's true.
But it could be even bigger, especially by the votes of six female indictees from the front and the young electorate, between 18 and 29 years of age, who, although not acting upon the president, are no longer voting."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he detailed the allegations of sexual abuse brought by the nomination to the Supreme Court, the analysts suggested that it might be counterproductive if the Republicans continued the confirmation process.
"This has become a public loan," said Michael Steele, president of the National Committee of the Republican, at the beginning of last week, according to NCB News.
"It is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote or the possibility of Kavanaugh to be confirmed, but also how the Republicans dealt with this situation and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of the USA's Priorities, an electoral support group for the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be relatively divided about the party they should believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's beliefs: a little more seems to believe it later.
A new poll conducted by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents believe with respect or think it is likely that Ford's testimony was true, while 35% said that they believed with respect or that it is likely that Kavanaugh's testimony to be true.
In addition, 38% said that Kavanaugh was lying, probably or safe, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations as well as at least another person, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford made a sworn oath in front of the Senate's judicial committee that Kavanaugh abused her in Hebrew at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nominee at the Supreme Court exposed the genital organs in front of her when she participated in a party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web inventor plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web inventor, launchs a launch that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest legend project in technology, Inrupt, is a solid-based company, open-source platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt is "global domination".
"Now we have to do it," he said about the start.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal data archives" or PODs.
It may contain contact lists, programs, calendars, music libraries or other personal and professional instruments.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would be all available in one browser, all from one time.
What is unique about this online personal data archive is that the user has complete control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this " personal data consolidation".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea is that Inrupt will contribute with adequate resources, processes and skills, in such a way as to make Solid available to the whole world.
Currently, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a safety platform purchased by IBM, a team of developers working on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that he and his team do not talk to “Facebook and Google about whether to introduce or not a complete change when their business models are fully dataed over the head one time.
"We do not ask permission."
In a post published on Wednesday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee was an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even after Inrupt launch, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredible optimist for this is the next Internet," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: the clergy who won the Victoria Cross in World War I is celebrating
The only church of the Church of England who won a medal of the Victoria Cross right to fight in the First World War was celebrated in its native home after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverent Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918 in the Bellenglish and Lehacourt attack.
It was killed by a moonist four days later and never knew it was the highest honor of the British military.
A monumental stone was erected on Saturday by his two nephews during the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the nephews, Michael Vann, said he's "little by symbol" the fact that the stone will be revealed 100 years after the fact that his grandfather won the medal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led the battalion over the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a very direct and intense fire of artillery and metals".
Later, he quickly got to the line first and, with "a great miracle", opened the way for the soldiers, then attacked one of the artillery itself and managed to eliminate three of the weapons of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German lunetist on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "a thing I know I can never be equal to, but that makes me feel sorry".
This, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also landed a crown after the parade, which was led by the Orchestra of Lieutenant Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said that "it feels very honored to play a role in paradise" and added that "the value of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that many people have.
The MMA fans stayed all night watching Bellator 206, but they received animated drawings with Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine that you've been three all night following Bellator 206, an event with many stars, just so you can't follow the main event.
The San Jose event program contained 13 fights, including six on the main board, and had to be broadcast live all night in the British Sea on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, exactly when Gegard Mousasi was preparing to meet Rory MacDonald, British spectators were surprised when the transmission was replaced with an episode in Peppa Pig.
Some were not very grateful, because they stayed three all night watching the fight.
A fan described Twitter's transition to the animated drawing for children right "a kind of stupid joke".
"Governmental regulations say that this content is not appropriate for 6 o'clock in the morning, so they had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of Bellator for marketing and communication when he was asked about transmission.
"Court Peppa, yes."
Scott Cooker, the president of Bellator, said that, in the future, they will program their events in such a way that they can be followed by viewers from the British Sea.
"When I think about the rules, I think we could probably solve," said Coker.
"But it's 6:00 a.m. on a Sunday day here and we won't be able to do this until Sunday, our hour, or the moon, their hour.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, I started to receive a lot of text messages and were not all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, I thought it was a technical cure.
But it wasn't about that, it was about government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We're going to go back to five wars instead of six, as we usually do, and we're trying to offer more fans and we're over-limited.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" because of sexuality
Olympic sculptor Tom Daley says he grew up feeling that he was the least because of his sexuality, but this led him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he had accomplished only when he came to school that “not everyone is like me.”
Invited to the first issue of Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, on Radio 4, she said she was talking about gay people's rights to give them other "hope".
The sport also said that when he became a parent, he had less of the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the usual presentation of the traditional edition, will be missing a few months because of a disease.
Invited in the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that when he was a child, the others felt “lower” because "he was not socially acceptable to me to like boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, these feelings of inferiority and the fact that I felt different were the real things that gave me the strength and resistance to succeed."
He wanted to prove he's "someone", he said, so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally find out about his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympic Games has become a renowned supporter of the LGBT campaigns and has enjoyed the appearance of the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to ask more countries to criminalize homosexuality.
She said she decided to talk because she felt lucky that she could live free, without delay, and because she wanted to give other "hope".
The triple world champion said "it was taken by surprise" because she loved a man, American actor Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married last year to Oscar's winning movie, which is 20 years older than he, but said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much to such a fragile age," she participated in the first Olympic when she was only 14 years old, and her father died of cancer after three years - he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who would have passed through the same good and bad moments.
The two became, in June, the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, who, says Daley, changed "the whole perspective".
"If I had been asked last year, I wouldn't have been interested in anything but winning a gold medal," she said.
“You know what? There are things more important than gold medals at the Olympic Games.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears his father’s name, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with cerebral cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted to find out was if he received tickets for the 2012 Olympic Games in London, because he wanted to be first.
"I couldn't tell him "You can't be first," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and soon after he stopped breathing and died I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
In the following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that I wanted to spend my whole life in front of my country's spectators at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired him in his choice music, Proud de Heather Small, which encouraged him before the Olympic Games and still stimulates him.
Desert Island Discs is transmitted to BBC Radio 4 Sunday, at 11:15 p.m.
Mickelson, out of shape, was transferred to the reserve bank on Saturday, in Copa Ryder.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday, when he will play in the fourteenth and seven games from Cupa Ryder, but he will have to return to a good shape so that it won't be an unhappy occasion.
Mickelson, who plays in the bilateral event for the twenty-first time, another record, was transferred to the reserve bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and Saturdays.
Instead of being in the centre of action, as it was many times for the US team, the winner of major tournaments and shared the day between being major for co-ships and exerting his attacks, hoping that he would correct what was wrong.
The 48-year-old player had never had the right drivers, not even in the best period of his career, so it's not the best choice for Le Golf National, where the long-distance round areas are more than the wrong shots.
And if the land is not a great challenge, in the next Sunday Mickelson will face Francesco Molinari, the British Open methic champion, who joined the newsman Tommy Fleetwood and won all of the four games of the week.
Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial to Americans, leading with four points to entry into the 12 simple games, which must begin in force at this stage.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player's ability, but he couldn't have said anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, beat me up, dressed me and told me he'd be ready for tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He had a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams last week and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play in two games.
I figured out more, but that's what happened, and that's the way I thought we had to go.
He wants to play, like everyone else."
Sunday, Mickelson will skip Nick Faldo's record for most of the games played in Copa Ryder.
This could be the end of his career in Cupa Ryder, which no longer grew up in his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 games won, 20 lost and seven percent lost, although Furyk said his presence has brought some incredible benefits to the team.
"It's funny, it's boring, it's smart, it's fun to laugh with players, it's a wonderful guy in the team's dresser," he explained.
"I think young players are having fun with him, it was fun to see them doing this during the week.
His role is more important, not just in the game."
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that considerable progress could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that the considerable progress made before the first day of simple trials in Cupa Ryder can easily be transformed into an unpleasant journey.
The Danes started in the 1997 Valderram game, when the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros led the Americans with five points, but only if it managed to overcome them with a minimum difference, from 1411⁄2 to 1311⁄2.
"I recall that I had a significant advance in Valderrama; I had a big advance and Brooklyn, where I lost, and Valderrama, where I just had the chance to win," Bjorn (in the picture) said after following the 2018 team, which won with 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, and now leads with 10-6 Le Golf National.
"So history shows me, me and my team, that it's not ready yet.
Tomorrow we have to play at the maximum speed.
Let's get out of the field and do everything perfectly.
The game is ready only after the points are pasted on the table.
We have a purpose and this is to win this trophy, it must remain the target.
I've always said, we have to focus on the 12 players in our team, but we know what we expect in the other part: the best players in the world."
Impressed by the way his players worked on a difficult field, Bjorn added: “I don’t rush to draw conclusions.
Tomorrow it's all different.
Tomorrow are important individual performances, and this is different.
It's great to be on the ground with a partner when things go well, but when you're on your own, then you're tested at maximum, as a golf player.
This is the message you have to send to the players, that it must be in the best form tomorrow.
Now leave their partner behind and he has to play as well as he can."
Apart from Bjorn, Jim Furyk, captain of the opposite team, hopes his players will play better on the test simply than they did with their partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was from both parties of the same kind of return in the last days: he was in the winning team from Brooklyn, then in the loser when Europe won the "Miracle from Medina".
"I remember every word," he answered when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, managed to encourage his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow and we would like to start with some quick victories, like at Brooklyn, like at Medina.
When inert is developed in a direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those games from the middle.
We've created the corresponding battalion and ordered the players as we wanted, you know, we're trying to create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was commissioned to lead the fight: he will face Rory McIlroy in the main game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans from the second half of the programme.
"I have chosen this group of players, in this order, because I think it covers all the subjects," Bjorn said about the battalion for simple proof.
The new German war zone, re-examined
The newest cargo of German shipping forces would have to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the old warships in the Red War, but this will only happen in the year, due to poor systems and growth costs, has reported local pressure.
The entry into operation of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", a standard ship of the new Baden-Wuertemberg frigate class, was now launched until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which reads a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been introduced into the maritime forces in 2014, but the problems encountered after delivery affected this ambitious project.
The four baths of the Baden-Wertemberg class that Marina Military ordered in 2007 will replace the old brakes of the Bremen class.
They are expected to be provided with a strong tunnel, with a range of anti-air and anti-vas rockets, as well as steel technology, which ensures a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic print.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for new entrants to be able to go to missions for two years without returning to the original port.
However, the delay continues to mean that these vessels of war of the last generation, which are said to increase Germany's maritime strength, will be old before entering the service, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 Ghinionist was discussed last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Bluehm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time Marina Military returned a construction vessel after delivery.
There are not too much information about the reasons for the refusal, but the media in Germany has cited a number of crucial "software and hardware" deficiencies that would have made the warship useless in a war mission.
Software deficits were particularly important because the Baden-Wertemberg class vessels will be operated by a team of about 120 sailors, only half of the teams of the older ones of the Bremen class.
In addition, it has been shown that the vessel had too much weight, which has reduced its performance and limited the capacity of the military to add future supplies.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton vessel "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as difficult as the German vessels used in the World War II.
Alongside the weak mechanisms, and the price of the whole project, including the team's instruction, has become a cause for concern.
This is said to have reached the figure of EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion), at the initial price of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of the new ones are of particular importance in view of the latest warnings that say that Germany's maritime power is falling.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that Marina Military has "started to remain empty which can be sent to missions".
The officer stated that the problem had continued to grow over time, because the old vessels had been removed from function without being replaced with some new ones.
This is because none of the charges in the Baden-Wertemberg class have entered into force within the Military Navy.
National Trust spys on the secret life of liens
New research carried out on a Scottish Highlands property will reveal how they use environmental relief to make their way out.
It is hoped that the discoveries will reveal new things about the behavior of these inaugural mammals and will help future conservation activities.
The study conducted by National Trust for Scotland's scientists will analyze common smallpox and pigment lilies, as well as hearing and water lilies from the Inverwe Gradinile in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be expanded in key locations around the property to monitor the activity of the holiday during the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using manual detection.
The specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of the sounds made by lilyses and what certain species emit.
They will be produced and a map of the apartment and a report, to create a detailed picture, at the bottom, of their behaviour in the environment.
Rob Dewar, an consultant on conservation of nature for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal what habitat areas are the most important for lily and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the community's management work, such as the creation of the gas, and which is the best way to maintain forests for lily and other associated species.
The population of the Scotia and the whole Great Britain fell significantly in the last century.
These are risks of construction and development that affect the holes, but also the loss of the habitat.
And electric turbines and public lighting are risks, just as they are mouse caps and some chemical treatment for construction materials, but also domestic fish attacks.
Actually, the lilies aren't bright.
However, due to the fact that they spend the night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it's about taking the shower.
They use a sophisticated ecosystem technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles to their flight path.
NTSC, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is seriously concerned about the lilies.
These have ten trained experts, who conduct periodic studies, control the holes and, sometimes, perform rescue missions.
The organisation has created even the first and only reservation of tickets from Scotland, on the Threave Museum in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of lily from Scotland are found.
The husband's manager, David Thompson, says this is the ideal territory for lilys.
"Here, in Threave, the area is wonderful for lilys," he says.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there's a lot of things we don't know about vacations, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand why they need this to multiply."
This underlines the importance of looking for lilys before carrying out maintenance work on property, as simple unintended destruction of a maternal cave could kill up to 400 women and then, which can destroy the entire local population.
Lilies are protected, and killings, killings or interruptions, as well as destruction of their throats, are prohibited actions.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer in Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help him.
It said: "If we have a lot to learn about lilys and we don't know how the population evolves for many of our species."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers are preparing to give the German newspaper in court
Cristian Ronaldo said the charges against him are "fake news" and that some people "will complain" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to give in court German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese attacker and the Juventus team were accused of violating an American woman, identified by Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported Friday that the football player paid her $375.000 for not talking about an accident.
A few hours after the charges were published, in a video clip on Instagram Live for 142 million of its followers, Ronaldo, at the age of 33, said they are "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today are fake news," said the winner of the Gold Balloon in front of the video room.
"I want to make a statement using my name.
It's normal.
They want to reach the celebrities using my name, but I'm used to it.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player, laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to judge Der Spiegel for these charges, which they have called them "an unacceptable report of suspects who hold private life," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player will ask for an apology for "a moral tax equivalent to an appropriate sum for the gravity of the fact, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009, in an apartment at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met in a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he violated his ring, according to documents from the District Court of Clark Committee in Nevada.
Majorga claims that, after the accident, Ronaldo fell in his knees in front of her and told her that she was "a good boy" in proportion to "99%", and that she was betrayed by that "a percentage".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sexual relations with the accused, but that they were consensual.
Majorga claims that she was sent to the police and that her injuries were taken to the hospital, but she later accepted an understanding outside the trial because she was "tirred by the possibility of a defendant" and was concerned that "will be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman is now seeking to cancel that understanding because she continues to be traumatized by an accident.
At the time of the attack he was accused, Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This evening he was transferred to the Italian giant Juventus, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: The British Sea "and regrets the loss of car manufacturers"
The British Sea "will regret it" if it loses the status of world leader in the production of cars after Brexit, said Secretary for business Greg Clark.
It added that it is "anxious" that Toyota UK has declared to the BBC that, if Britain comes out of the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese automaker said that the impact of delays on the border in the case of a Brexit without an agreement could cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where Auris and Avensis are manufactured in Toyota, produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My point is that, if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March, production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car producers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, said they were afraid to leave the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the factory from Oxford where the Mini model is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what producers call associated risks to the supply chain in the event of an unaccompanied Brexit.
Toyota's production line works on the basis of the "fix in time": for machines manufactured by command, the pieces arrive at an interval of 37 minutes from suppliers from the British Sea and from the EU.
If the British Sea leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be problems at the border, which, according to industrial producers, could cause delays and a lack of part.
It would be impossible for Toyota to deposit more than the inventory for one day at his Derbyshire factory, says the company, so the production would be stopped.
Clark said theresei May's Chequers plan for future EU relations is "calibrated precisely to avoid these delays at the border".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best deal, which will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the present, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," said it for today's BBC Radio 4.
"The links from Toyota not only, but also from other producers, show that we must continue to use what was a very successful supply launch set."
Toyota could not determine how long the production would have to be stopped, but warned that increased prices could reduce the long-term competitive capacity of the factory and ultimately lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who works at 24-year-old Burnaston and is responsible for the United Trade Union trade union, said that members are increasingly concerned: "The experience has taught me that, after disappearing, these jobs are no longer coming back."
A government spokesman said: "I have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU."
Trup's meeting with Rosenstein could be breakfast yesterday, says Casa Alba
The high-level meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "betrayed another week", because the battle for Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court, continued, declared the House of Albă Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's interferences in the elections, links between Trump's and Russia's aid and the potential for the banning of justice by the president.
The appeals about the possibility of Trump grant to the Deputy Attorney General, thus endangering Mueller's independence, around Washington's circles for months.
Early in the month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump and the possibility of suspending presidents through amendment 25 to the US Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But last month he went to the White House, and reports say he was on his way out.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced for Thursday at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he "would rather not" grant Rosenstein, but then the meeting was scheduled to avoid a conflict with the hearing of the Senate's legal committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, filed testimony.
Friday, Trump asked for a week's investigation of the FBI's charges against Kavanaugh, which has renewed the vote in the plenary of the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared Sunday at Fox News.
Speaking of the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: “It may be this week or it may be a week, taking into account all the other things that are now being done at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'll always like to hold on to the current."
Some reporters would reply to this statement: Sanders no longer had a press briefing at the White House on September 10.
Mrs. Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that reducing the number of briefings was not caused by the antipathy in front of TV reports, which they liked to give in the show, although he added: "I don't deny that they like to give in the show."
Then, he suggested he would have broken the direct contact between Trump and press.
"The president participates in more meetings of questions and answers than all previous presidents," she said, adding, without saying any evidence: "I have analyzed the figures."
"I want more briefings," Sanders further said, but "I think it's much better for the press to have the opportunity to address direct questions to the President of the United States, not me.
We're trying to do this more and more times and you could see that we've done this many times in the last weeks, and discussions with the Presidents of the United States will replace the briefings when it's available."
Trump usually answers questions when leaving the White House or when attending open meetings or press conferences with the complainants who visit him.
It's rare for all the press conferences to be held exclusively by him.
This week in New York, the president showed why this was happening, with an improvised appearance on the sidewalks in front of the reports gathered.
A State Secretary of the Ministry of Health addressed in a letter to EU employees from the National Health Service (NHS) of the Scotia on Brexit-related fears
The Secretary of State wrote to EU employees working at the NHS branch of Scotland to express recognition on behalf of the country and the desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of Parliament of Scotland, sent the letter under six months' time to withdraw the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already taken the commitment to support the requests for a permanent residence status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "Over the years, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, waiting for decisions to be taken in this autumn.
But the UK Government has begun to prepare more and more for a different scenario, in which there would be no agreement to get out of the EU.
I know it's a very stressful period for you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Members of the European Union, but also beyond that, have valuable experience and skills that support and improve the work of the health service and also benefit the patients and the communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is under emergency surgical intervention after he suffered a stroke on his head
The Foundation of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgical intervention after he suffered a stroke on Saturday, in which his team lost him in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores team, with the score of 31-27, declared Mike Organ from Tennessee.
The main coach of the Tennessee State team, Rod Reed, told the reporters that the shooting took place shortly before the break.
"He got to the bottom line and just broke up," Reed said.
Abercrombie has put oxygen masks by the physical manufacturers and medical personnel on the tube line before he has placed it on a map and carried it from the ground for a detailed assessment.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie came out of the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no details about the type/extension of the accident" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it was produced.
Abercrombie, student in the second year, is in his first season in Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
Saturday, it was able to make five total matches before leaving the game, reaching a number of 18 places throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be treated as a higher tax on buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will pay a higher tax on buying a property in the United Kingdom, in order to use additional money to assist people without delay, in accordance with the new plans of the Conservative Party
This change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young people with the right to vote
Court of Justice shall apply to persons who are not taxable and taxable in the United Kingdom
The treasure is expected to weigh up to 120 million pounds per year for the aid of homeless persons
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher rate of early trial rate in purchasing a property in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help people without charge, as announced today Theresa May.
The change will be considered an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young people with the right to vote, promising houses with more favourable prices and seeing people with large incomes.
The higher court rate will be applied to natural and legal persons who are not taxable and taxable in the United Kingdom, and the additional money thus obtained will be used to support the Government's efforts to help people without delay.
The ceiling, which is added to the current timbre court rate, including the levels raised over two years for the second property and the property purchased for the purpose of purchase, could reach a 3% value.
The treasure is expected to bring this change to up to 120 million sterline readings per year.
About 13% of the new properties built in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for those who want to buy their first home.
More prosperous areas of the country, especially capital, have become "fathomous" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes only a few weeks ago when Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the price of the stamp to help young people buy their first house.
It accused large construction firms that they maintain high ownership prices as a result of the acquisition of land without using them and requested Theresa May to drop to the prices for affordable houses in order to solve the "house problems" of the British Sea.
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive reforms in the real estate area, including control over sharks and slowing down unreasonably evacuations.
He also wants to offer more powerful advice on building new houses.
Theresa May stated: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my priority to the fulfillment of the British vision, a better life for every new generation.
And that means solving the existing problems on the real estate market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign-owned companies, to be able to buy homes as easily as British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a house has become too distant, and life in bad conditions is too real."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to be the national team manager of Scotland"
Jack Ross, manager of the Sunderland football team, said that "his final goal" is to become, at a given time, the national team manager of Scotland.
The Scottish, at 42 years of age, is pleased with the promotion of the North-East Club, which is currently located at 3 in the First League, with a difference of three points to the first place.
This evening he moved to the team at the Luminian Stadium after he succeeded in returning to the St. Mirren football team in the first Scottish Premiership division.
"I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
We arrived in the B team of the national and about that," Ross for Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
"But I spent most of my childhood following the Scotch games at Hampden with my father and I always wanted to come back.
But I'll be part of this opportunity only if I'm successful as the club manager."
Among the presidents of Ross, as manager of the Sunderland Club, is Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyt and Paulo Di Canio.
The former director of the Alloa Athletic club said that he does not feel like the successor of such dedicated names and at a club so important, after he refused offers from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"The only thing that concerns me and that could affect my success is the question "Can I help this team come back to Premier League?"
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities of this club allow it to be in Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to do it there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel a successful man is to contribute to the club's return to Premier League."
Ross has only three years of experience in driving, after a period in which he was assisted by manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a member of the training staff at Hearts.
Then it helped Alla's club come back after she retrograded in Division C and managed to save St. Mirren from retrograde, helping the team win the champion's title in the next season.
Ross said he feels better now than in his entire career as a player at Clyde, Hartpool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was a decisive moment," he said about taking over the leadership of Alloa Club.
"I really thought I deserved the manager's role more than the player.
It may sound strange, because I had a good time, I had a good time, and I had a few successful moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them weekly.
They confront me with situations like manager, with regard to stress and pressure, but I feel it's the right role for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now that I can do this, I feel it's the best thing for me in my entire adult life."

The ideal time to drink a half beer is Saturday, at 17:30, according to a Sunday
The heat value of this summer led to an increase in revenue in the villages of the British Sea, putting more pressure on restaurants.
According to figures, pubs and bars, there was an increase of 2.7% in July, while restaurants' income dropped by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a representative of the CGA, who provided business consultation services and conducted the survey, said: “The constant warmth and participation of England in the World Cup for a longer period than the forecast contributed to a guy in July, like the previous month, when the villages registered with up to 2.8% more customers, while restaurants had a longer period.
The number of customers with less than 1.8% in the restaurant industry in June also decreased further in July.
The villages and bars serving only drinks have recorded a far greater benefit than restaurants.
And the people who serve food have recorded the losses caused by heat, but not the same size as the restaurants.
Looks like people just came out of town to consume drinks.
The sale of alcohol at all levels of bars and pubs has increased by 6.6% this month, and food has been recorded by 3%."
Paul Newman, a representative of the RSM offering services in the hospital industry, said: "These results continue the trend we have observed since the end of April.
The weather conditions and the impact of sports and social events of expansion remain among the most important factors contributing to the sales of the OOH advertising market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to record losses, although the decline in sales of 4.8% per year will add to current cost pressures.
Long canicular summer could not come at a much simpler moment for food industry operators and only time will decide whether the more moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news."
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including the new ones opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the lower number of new sites launched.
The company monitors the sales of pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operating groups, with a combined profit of over 9 billion sterline readings, which is the official standard in the industrial sector.
One of five children has a secret account on a social networking network that is hidden from parents
According to a Sunday, one of five children, some even up to 11 years of age, has a secret account on a social networking network that hides it from parents and teachers.
A survey conducted at the level of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “insta false” accounts.
Knowing the fears of sexual content
20% of students said they have a "primary" account that shows parents
One of five children, some even up to 11 years of age, creates an account on a social networking network that keeps it hidden from adults.
A survey conducted on a number of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the “insta false” accounts, referring to the Instagram photo sharing platform.
Knowing the fears of sexual content.
20% of students said that they have a "primary" and "cort" account that parents show, but that they also have other private accounts.
A mother, who mistakenly discovered her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret account, observed the post of a teenager who wanted to be “violent. ”
According to research conducted by Digital Awarenss from the United Kingdom and the Directors' Association (HMC – Headmasters' and Headmies' Conference) of independent schools, 40% of young people aged between 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them have recognised that they have secret accounts.
HMC's director, Mike Buchanan, said: "It's alarming that so many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers don't have access."
Eliidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scotia Sports Commission
Elidh Doyle was elected as Director-General, without executive power, of the Scots Committee, during the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated field and track athlete in Scotland, and Ian Beattie, President, described the change as a great opportunity for those who make decisions about sports to benefit from the vast experience that this has gained at international level in the past decade.
"Eilid is pleased to respect the whole community of athletes from Scotland, Britain, as well as around the world and we are sure that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits once they are included in the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle added: "I am pleased that I could represent athletes and hope to have a real contribution and to help the way sports activities are carried out in Scotland."
The American nationality athlete, who won the 200- and 400-metre samples at the Atlanta Games in 1996, along with the four gold medals won at the Olympic Games, is now a frequent reporter at the BBC, remained invalid after he suffered a transient exchange attack.
It wrote on Twitter: “After a month, I suffered a brain attack.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time will decide whether I will recover or whatever.
It was a titanic job, but I got back completely, I learned to go back, and today I'm practicing agility!
Thank you for the messages of comfort!"
A announcement on blood pumps comparing women with cows divides public opinion into the online environment
A tobacco company has caused the division of public opinion in the online environment with a advertising that compares mothers who are dealing with the bulk of the cows.
In order to mark the launch of a pump that would be “the first silent and portable pump in the world”, Elvie’s consumer technology company launched an ironic announcement inspired by a music video clip to present the freedom that a new pump offers to mothers that adapt.
Four real mothers dance in a full-fashioned song for cows on a melody that includes verses such as, "Yes, I'm sorry, but I don't have a code" and, "If you haven't noticed, these are not eggs, but my blood."
The rehearsal continues: “Pamp, pump, tap on the baby, pump, pump, pull the milk out of the girls.”
However, the claim, published on the company's Facebook page, has raised controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video was held with mixed reactions from those who saw it, many of them declaring it to be thrown out of the milk industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must remain pregnant and born to produce milk, except for the fact that children have been stolen only a few days from birth," wrote a person.
Elvie's blood pump is in a subtle way suitable for injection (Elvie/Mama)
Another person commented: “It’s understandable how traumatic it is for both mother and child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a blood pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone added: "A very disclaimer of nepotritis."
Other people have defended the claim, a person claiming that a "thirsty" claim has been made.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought one if we were still on.
The pumping really made me feel like a wolf.
The claim's a little unspoiled, but I took it as a trap.
But the product is great," wrote a person.
Another person commented: “It’s a fun advertising that looks at mothers who use pumps (often at work or in toilets) and feel like "wugs".
It's not a commercial that boasts or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the video clip, the group of women discovers that they have danced with discreet pumps introduced into the suite.
The concept that is based on the campaign is that many women who use the pump say they feel like the candles.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, does not have hair or tubes and is in a discreet manner suitable for fitting, offering women free movement, the opportunity to hold their children in their arms and even to get out of town while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, a partner, consultant and developer on Mother’s project, commented: “Pompa Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a shocking and provocative launch.
Compared to the mothers and milk cows, we wanted to highlight what is supposed to be the use of a blood pump and the trials in this sense, presenting, in a funny and real way, the incredible feeling of freedom that will give him the new pump.
It's not the first time the Elvie pump reaches the first page.
During the presentation of fashion creator Marta Jakubowski at the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the floor while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were transferred to hiding in a refugee camp at the border with Texas
The number of migrant children detained has increased, although the number of people who have crossed the border each month remained relatively the same, largely because the rejections and difficult policies introduced by the Trump administration have resulted in the accumulation of child placement procedures in sponsors.
Often, many sponsors are themselves immigrants without documents and fear that they will endanger the country's seat if they are asked to take the children.
The risks increased in June when the federal authorities announced that the potential sponsors, as well as other adult members of the family, must register the printers and that their data will be communicated to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official of the Vamal Authority and for Immigration and Customs Force, announced before the Congress that the agency arrested ten persons who requested the sponsorship of the minors.
Furthermore, the Agency confirmed that 70% of the arrests had no previous penalties.
"About 80% of the sponsors or members of the sponsors' family live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign offenders.
What it means we will continue to look for the respective individuals," Albence said.
In order to speed up the process of processing in the child's system, the authorities have introduced new rules, as the children must be submitted within one month of detention, and not at 60 days as provided for by the previous standard, in accordance with the conditions laid down in this Regulation.
Many will complain for the case by means of a video call, and not personally in front of a judge of immigration, to request the statute of legal residence.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they may become indifferent or depressed, which may lead to violent or attempted eviction reactions, according to employees and reports issued by the system in recent months.
Lawyers have stated that these concerns are accentuated at a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is the possibility of signs indicating that a child has problems are not observed due to the size of the unit.
They added that the transfer of children to the refugee camp without providing them enough time for emotional training or to keep them well from friends could cause them pain, many of them already suffer.
Syria requests the US, French and Turkish military forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although Syria was in the war for eight years.
Moulalem, who is also an interim prime minister, said that foreign military forces are illegally located in a Syrian territory under the pretext of combating terrorism and that "the situation will be properly managed".
"This must be withdrawn immediately and without any condition," he said during the assembly.
Moulalem insisted on the fact that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died beginning in 2011, and millions of people were displaced from their homes.
It further stated that Damascus will continue "this sacred war until we have expelled terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories".
In Syria there are about 2,000 military troops in the United States, who are particularly involved in training and counseling Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
There are also more than 1,000 French military troops in the war-laden country.
With regard to the refugee problem, Moualem stated that there are favourable conditions for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading Iraqi fears", since it decided to stay away.
It added: "I have requested the support of the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return."
"There are political influences in a problem that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support the reconstruction in Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war is established.
The United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to prolong the last group of rebels has created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has contributed to avoiding a great wave of expansion with the help of the Russians, supported by the Russians, over the province where three million people live.
However, Moulalem highlighted the fact that the agreement has a "clear deadline" and expressed the hope that military action will look at the Jewish groups, including the Nusra front, which have links to the Al-Qaeda network and which "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations Ambassador, hopes to meet soon at a first meeting of a new formed committee of government members and opposition to the drafting of a post-war constitution for Syria and to prepare the country for elections.
Moulalem presented the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee, stating that the activities of the Committee should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and issued a notice of interference.
Why will Trump win the second mandate
If we take this logic, Trump will be real in 2020, except where the destruction procedure or the scandals will end its presidential mandate earlier, which is what a large part of the free hearing is expected to happen.
In this case it would certainly be "the most dramatic final of a presidential mandate of all times!"
So far, it seems that the audience is still interested in subject.
Since 2014, first-time hearings have doubled to CNN, reaching 1.05 million and almost tripled to MSNBC, reaching 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, for the first time, Fox News television post was followed, on average, by 2.4 million people, four years ago when it was 1.7 million, and the release of "The Rachel Maddow Show" from MSNBC recorded an audience record with 3.5 million people who followed it in the series where important news was broadcast.
"This is a subject that attracts the public, because we cannot understand it," said Neal Baer, the producer of the drama series "Reservation President" from the ABC, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the capital building.
In Savoll, a comedy writer with a wide experience in the field and authorizing the paper "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She remembers a trip by Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote with Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because it makes me laugh,' he said to me.
In chaos, fun is valued.
Of course, except for anything else that is broadcast on TV, the action carried out in Washington could determine the future of the Roe Versus Wade case if immigrant families can be filled out and about the state of the global economy.
Change of position is a luxury that only the privileged public can afford.
However, you are not only a informed citizen when you arrive at the sixth watch of the debate by a committee of experts in the way Bob Woodward uses "deep background" (confidentially) resources for his book, "Fear", about the strip jacket worth $15,000 of Paul Manafort" (a "opportunity vesting object", according to The Washington Post) and the implications of the famous descriptions of Stormy Daniels's "anatomous parts".
For example, I'll never forget Super Mario in the same way.
"A lot of what makes you feel that you look at a real show and feed yourself with subjects every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive director of the media group Wheelhouse Entertainment and the founder of the "Soy Amamette", about the constantly changing distribution and recovery of the daily situation caused by Trump (declaration of a survey with the American Football Professional League, the praise brought to Kim Jong-Un's address).
Don't let you lose an episode, 'cause you'll feel like you're behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week in his home on the north coast of the island of Kaai, there were 27 degrees outside and it was the sun, and he sat inside looking at MSNBC and recording from CNN.
He could not get out of front of the television, especially when Brett Kavanaugh was going to meet with the Senate's legal commission and had to decide on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember we made some emissions out of the community in the past, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it seems I was right."

Compulsory external financial resources for the most recent intermediate elections associated with the Chamber of Representatives
As a result of a realisation of electoral districts, which resulted in two holders of the mandate in an electoral course for the same function, it is not surprising that the 17th electoral district of the state of Pennsylvania enjoys the combined financial resources.
Thus, the new suburban of the Pittsburg district has led to the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won, in another district, the special elections of the past spring.
Lamb is running against another mandate holder, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the 12th electoral district of Pennsylvania, which is above the 17th.
The electoral papers were reconfigured after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were not constitutional, with the restrictions on the districts for the benefit of the Republicans.
The new 17th electoral district course has launched a competition in the financing of campaigns between the major funding agencies of the parties, the Congress Committee for the Campaign of Democrats (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign (NCRC).
Lamb became a popular name in Pennsylvania after a sharp victory in the course of a special, maximum hearing elections, which took place in March for the 18th electoral district of Pennsylvania.
For more than a decade, the function was occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won this district with a difference of 20 points.
According to political commentators, democracy enjoys an easy advantage.
The United States took into account the penalization of El Salvador for its understanding with China, but then gave up.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a preliminary meeting with the Presidents of the Republic of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the management team of the Trump Organization.
The State Department officials decided to call the US heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of "the recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman in a statement early this month.
However, sanctions were taken only against the state of El Salvador, which received US assistance at approximately $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and the high rate of fraud and crime.
As the internal meetings have recorded progress, North American and Central American officials have extended a high-level conference, focusing on security and economic prosperity, to continue a similar meeting last year, considered a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from reaching the United States.
But by mid-September, officials from the administration's front showed clearly that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively completing any review of the sanctions for El Salvador.
Now it is planned that Vice-President Mike Pence address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to highlight the importance of the administration of an agreement to the meeting, the diplomats have declared.
And the three American ambassadors returned to the silences in El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving new messages or sentences from Washington.
A spokesman from the White House for John Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if they were kept anonymous.
Their relations were co-ordinated by an external analyst, who is close to the administration and who also spoke on the condition of the preservation of the anonymity.
Study of history
The next thing that could happen is the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstacle to justice by President Trump, which now has strong evidence made public.
It also appears that Mueller is leading his own investigation and on the investigation of the existence of an agreement between the Trump and Russia campaign on the attack on the American elections.
In the event that Congress will change, Trump will face the appropriate response within the body, even when it is prepared to appear before the voters and may, possibly, be a legal form of his colleagues.
There are many possible situations and I do not want to suggest that a "fall" of Trump is inevitable, valid and for its omologists in Europe.
There are choices we have to make for all of us on one side of the Atlantic and who will decide the duration of the investigation.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to give a coup against Hitler, only if the West was opposed and supported by the Czechs in Munich.
I failed and lost this opportunity to avoid the massacre years that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans face such critical moments right now.
What will we do if Trump sends him to the general prosecutor-in-chief Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein is in a difficult position since it was reported in this newspaper that last year it suggested the Secretary's secret registration and reflected on his incompatibility with the role of the President.
Rosenstein said the Times report was wrong.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation concerning Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court in the face of credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that will bring him to the answer to Trump?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long summer.
But I don't think we'll fail after the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish Czech origin who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied me with the ambassadorial residence.
He survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, he sent me to light Saturdays on the grassy table.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Player Graham Dorrans from the Rangers team is optimistic about the game with Rapid Vienna
Joi, Rangers will be a gas team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that victory in the Austrian game, after the impressive Spanish match against the Villarreal team from early Monday, will place it in a strong position to qualify from the G Group of the European League.
An accident on the knees did not allow middle-aged Graham Dorrans to play this season until 2-2 with Villarreal, but he thinks that the Rangers team can use this result in his advantage to achieve better performance.
"It was a good point for us, considering that Villarreal is a good team," said 31-year-old player.
"We started the game thinking we'll get a good outcome and we won a point.
I've probably been able to write at the end, but, in total, I think the equation was a good result.
I think they've been better in the first time, and we've noticed better in the second.
Joi, it'll be a big night for Europe again.
At least we'll get three points, but it'll be a hard game, because they've had a good result in the last game played. However, with support from the players, we'll probably feel more motivated and have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a challenge, taking into account my accidents and club changes, but the situation is better at the moment.
The team is good and the boys really like to be here; the training goes, too, fine.
Let's hope that we will endure, that we will leave the last season and that we will have good results."
Women have dreams of retirement savings
Despite the fact that Sunday participants knew clearly how to be concerned, few people talked to family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the study conducted by the Nationalwide company said he was discussing the cost of long-term care with his or her spouse.
Only 10% of them said they were able to talk to their children about this subject.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but does not start this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Life Insurance Company.
Here's how you can start.
Talk with your spouse and children: You can’t prepare a family to care for your needs if you don’t know the needs of time.
Work with the consultant and the family to discuss the location and manner in which you will be concerned, as these choices could represent a significant factor for establishing costs.
Involve the financial advisor: and the financial advisor can be of real help in the payment of these costs.
Your long-term funding options may include a long-term standard insurance policy, a digital life insurance policy, to help you cover these costs or to ensure your own well-being – to the extent that you have money.
Put the legal documents on the point: you come to the legal problems of the legal nature.
Get a computer on medical decisions, to appoint a trusted person who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals in this area respect your wishes if you cannot communicate with them.
Also take into account the performance of a computer with regard to your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person who will take the financial decisions in your name and who will ensure that you are aware of the facts, if you do not have the ability to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that a parent with an advanced age has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about her medications and allergic reactions?
Note these details in a written plan to be prepared.
"And it's not just about the financial side. Can you tell who the doctors are dealing with it?" asked Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of his dogs?
Please draw up a plan for all these things."
A man was shot several times with a compressed air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a compressed air gun while he went home after a night's party in town.
The victim, aged 40, is located in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdominal and hand.

Cuttlefish and tuna in Indonesia
At least 384 people died because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Palu, Indonesia, according to the authorities, and is expected to increase the number of deaths.
As a result of the interruption of the communications networks, the disaster authorities were unable to obtain any information from the Dodrea Regent, a zone in the north of Palu, which is closer to the coastal epicenter with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees on Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key information about Palu and Dodrea, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of the center of the island of Sulawesi, which is located at the end of an engust golf course, on the western coast of the island of Sulawasi, with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated 40 years of existence when it was hit by tsunamis and tsunamis.
Dondrea is a regenital that extends on a coast with a surface of more than 300 km north-west of the Sulawesi island.
Regenzia, an administrative region located in the province of Josué, has a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture activities represent the central point of the province's economy from the centre of the island of Sulawesi, in particular the coastal region of Dodrea.
Mining activities for the extraction of nickel are also important in the province, but are concentrated in Morovali, on the coast of the Sulawesi island.
Palu and Dondria have been hit by tsunamis more than once in the last 100 years, according to the Disaster Management Agency in Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami caused the death of more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dodrea.
Also, in 1996, a tsunami struck the vegetarian part of the Dondrea Regency, causing the death of the new person.
Indonesia is located in the Circulation of the Pacific, a zone with intense seismic activity.
Here are a few of the costs and tsunamis carried out in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of the island of Sumatra, announced a tsunami that struck 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half being from Aceh.
2005: a series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of the island of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, along the coast of the island of Sumatra.

2009: a 7.6-degree crater on Richter scale took place near the town of Padang, the capital of the province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: a 7.5-degree square on Richter's scale struck one of the Isle of Mentawai, along the coast of the island of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami with a height of up to 10 metres, which destroyed ten satire and killed about 300 people.
2016: a decline in intensity occurred in the Pydie Jaya Regengen in Aceh, causing pay and panic, because people and people remembered the 2004 disaster and tsunami, which fought with a large number of deaths.
This time a tsunami didn't strike, but more than 100 people died because of the damaged buildings.
2018: More powerful crossings took place on the island of Lombok, causing the death of more than 500 people, most of the northern part of the island.
The bridge destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists remained temporarily locked under walls.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested following allegations of violence.
Palin, aged 29, from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested under the suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a domestic violence claim and in opposition to arrest, according to a weekly report published by the police in Alaska state.
According to the police report, when a knowledge of this sex woman tried to call the police to claim crimes, she took her phone.

They were also charged with a Class B offence, which was sentenced to one day in prison and an amendment of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin was brought to charges like this.
In December 2017, he was charged with violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to announce the alleged aggression.

The federal prosecutor wants capital punishment for suspecting the terrorist attack in New York City.
New York's federal prosecution wants the capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City after which eight people were killed, a rare sentence that has not been applied in state for a federal offence since 1953.
It seems that Saipov, at the age of 30, used a truck hired Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle track on the West Side highway from the lower Manhattan, hitting piketons and cyclists on its trajectory in October.
In order to justify capital punishment, prosecutors must prove that Saipov has deliberately killed the eight victims and has “intensibly caused” serious physical injuries, in line with the intentional opinion on the request for capital punishment, which was sent to the Southern District of New York.
Both charges may receive a capital feeling, in accordance with the document of the court.
In a few weeks after the attack, a large federal juror accused Saipov of 22 charges involving eight charges of crime in support of organized crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation", the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov carried out the "audio, cruel and wrongful" act.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, suffering and loss for the families and friends of the following persons: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco”, according to the intention opinion.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last sentence of a case of capital punishment in the South District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with killing two drug dealers, but he was later sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last capital punishment applied in a federal case in New York took place in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two women executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit a spying act for the Soviet Union during the Great War, two years earlier.
Rosenberg's wife was executed at the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the documents of the court, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no regret in the days and months of the attack.
He convinced the investigators that he liked what he did, according to the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he felt compelled to execute the attack after watching the ISIS video clips on his phone, according to the director.
Also, according to the police, he asked for the ISIS stairwell in the hospital room.
He was accused of being innocent of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the defenders of the office who represented Saipov, said they are obviously disappointed by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply the capital sentence, instead of accepting a life sentence sentence, without any means of release, will only prolong the associated trauma for all the persons involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team asked previous prosecutors not to apply the capital punishment.
A member of Parliament who is a party to the Conservative Party claims that NIGEL FARGE must be held in front of the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised today that he would "mobilise the civilian army", during a protest at the Conservative Party's conference.
The former Ukip leader stated that politicians should "smell pressure" from Eurosceptics, following a statement by a member of Parliament Theresei May who suggested that it should be in front of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative Party, said at a demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have "exited" until now if Farage was Secretary in the Brexit campaign.
However, the challenge faced by May with regard to extreme dividends was highlighted by the members of the Conservative Party who joined another protest against the departure from the European Union organised in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to address its commitment plan, such as the Chequers plan, to deal appropriately with attacks by those who support the absence of the European Union, who want to remain in it, as well as by the European Union.
The alliances stressed that it would continue to try to conclude an agreement with Brussels, regardless of consequences, and will force the Eurosceptics and the Laburist Party to choose between its offer and "haos".
Good said in the event of the Pro-Brexit Leave Means Leave from Solihull that he wanted "the announcement of the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If things were his, I was no longer in the European Union," he said.
The Conservative Member of Parliament, representative of Wellingborough, added: "You will support Brexit, but we must abandon the Chequers plan."
Referring to its opposition to the European Union, it said: "We have not fought in the world wars to be served.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Good denied the suggestions on changing public opinion to the 2016 vote: "It is not true that the British have rebelled and that they will remain in the Union."
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Conservative Party that supports Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told the reporters: "I just want to say so: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the voices of the people.
"The public does not agree with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party does not agree with him and our activists who are on the road and who support us, firstly, in the election.
You give up on the Chequers plan and you start listening."
In a message pointing to Theresa May, she added: "Ministers who maintain their role are those who respect their promises."
During the meeting, Nigel Farage stated that politicians should be placed in a situation of "pressure" if they are on their way to give up the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It is a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"We're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them that "we're not going to let him do this."
In a letter of appreciation, he added: “I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
"We mobilize the civil army of the country that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-government and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those who support the stay in the European Union traveled through Birmingham two hours ago in the city centre.
A small group of activists raised banners written "The Conservative Party is against the Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
Lord Adonis, member of the Laburist Party, has been laughing at the members of the Conservative Party and the security problems encountered in the application of the Party at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can implement IT systems and all technology for Canada further, to digitise customs procedures, to free and unlimited trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a joke.
Brexit doesn't bring benefits," he added.
Warren is planning to think seriously to apply to the presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the United States said he would seriously consider candidates for the presidency after the November elections.
According to the Boston Globe newspaper, the democratic senator of Massachusetts spoke on Saturday about her future during a spring meeting in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for elections in November against Geoffrey Diehl, a member of the Chamber of Representatives of the Republican Party, who was co-chaired by Donald Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She was in the center of the speculation that she could defeat Trump in 2020.
The afternoon afternoon event in Holyoke was a meeting with 36 voting citizens using the Prime Minister's format since Trump took over the President's office.
A participant asked her if she was going to apply to the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come for "women to reach Washington to solve the problems of our seriously affected government, and that includes finding a woman in front of him."
A suspect was arrested in case of death caused by the death of the player Sims from the LSU team
The Baton Rouge police, Los Angeles, announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the event of death that caused the death of the Wyde Sims basketball player from the LSU.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They published a video material at the time of the shooting of Friday, asking for help to identify the man from the pictures.
Sims, aged 20, was shot and killed near the campus at Southern University, tomorrow morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death," said police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday for 247ports.
Wade tried to call his friend and he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and recognized that he was in front of the place, that he was in possession of a gun, but that he shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was taken to police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a young player, with a height of 1.98 m, who grew in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, being 10 times in the original slot in the last season and playing, on average, 17.4 minutes, with 5.6 points and 2.9 recoverys on games.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after his team helps him win in front of Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the time Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders will have an essential role to play.
Finding first position in class, Bottas had a good start and almost won Hamilton, appearing in the first two hours and inviting Vettel to attack his co-pilot.
Vettel was the first one who stopped at the box and left Hamilton at the group's queue, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes stopped at the box later and came from Vettel's back, but Hamilton managed to advance after some schemes that forced Ferrari's driver to leave the free interior, after he made a double move to defend himself to the third man.
Max Verstappen started running on the back of the truck and is located on the place close to the end of the first trip, even on the day when he was 21 years old.
Then he found himself in the front for a large part of the course, looking at a quick final and trying to pass over Kimi Raikkonen and take the place four.
Last time, he stopped at the tour with number 44, but he couldn't make the move in the last eight trips, Raikkonen staying on the four.
"It was a hard day. Valtteri did an extraordinary job all weekend and behaved like a real gentleman, letting me go.
And the team did a great job to win the Ferraris and do this double," Hamilton said.
An awful body language
President Donald Trump ironed Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday, during a discussion on her insistentness as it did not facilitate the "scream" of Christine Blasey Ford's letter, which accused Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court of sexual aggression.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate's Judicial Committee, noting that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are "bad, immoral and lying".
"The only thing that could happen and the good thing that would happen in the last days in the Senate, when you see hands, when you see people who are angry and wicked and immoral and liars," he said.
"When you see that they've published and passed the information and then I say they haven't done it.
They're not responsible.
Do you remember?
When did I ask Dianne Feinstein if she made it easier for her to "break" the document?
Do you remember her answer? She said: umm..poftim?
Oh, no.
I didn't do that."
Well, wait a minute.
No, I didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was "passed" in September, but Feinstein denied that "scuring" was produced from her office.
"I didn't hide the charges that I see about Ford and I'm not the one that made it easier for her "scream" to report," said Feinstein to the Commission, according to the Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep confidentiality and I did that exactly."
But her denial seems to have not been well received by the president, who commented during the Saturday meeting: “To be honest, it was a terrible body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing the defence of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that democracies use the charges to reach their own ends.
"I am determined to take power in any way possible.
Note the evil, immorality, it does not care who hurts and who must destroy to get power and control," said the president, according to the Mediaite website.

An air traffic controller died after ensuring the landing of a plane with hundreds of passengers during a crash
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered hero, dying after ensuring the safe landing of a plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have died and many are disappeared after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There were more powerful Replicas in the area and many people were blocked under the rest of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues had fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post from the control tour of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri in Palu, which became powerful.
This remains in place to ensure that the flight 6321 of Batik Air, which is on the track at that time, will be safe.
Then he dropped out of the air control tower when he noticed that it was about to explode.
He died in the hospital later.
The spokesman for the air navigation service provider from Indonesia stated that it is possible to decide to save hundreds of lives, according to the ABC News Australia post.
I've prepared an helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, she died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We are tired of this news," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the number of deaths could reach thousands of people, the national disaster management agency declaring that access is limited in the cities of Dodrea, Sigi and Boutong.
"We believe that the number will grow, as many victims are still in ruins and I have not had access to many of them," said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The prices up to six meters destroyed the city of Palu, following a common funeral.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said to Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance brings victims.
It's almost impossible to find possible water.
All the minimum marks are broken."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to offer help to survivors, but we don’t know what they will find in front of the place.
It's already a tragedy, but it could hurt."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu Sunday and said to the national army: “Please work day and night to complete all evacuation operations.
Are you ready?" declared CNN.
Indonesia was defeated at the beginning of this year's strike in Lombok, which fought more than 550 deaths.
A plane accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a person is missing after a plane crashed into a chain
The air carrier holding the aircraft that had landed in a cargo from the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now declared that one person was missing, after he said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the aircraft that had been wrecked.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger is missing after Saturday afternoon.
This has been mentioned as trying to find the man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details on the passenger, such as age or nationality.
The local boats were used to recover the other passengers and crew after the plane struck water while trying to land on the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Friday, the authorities said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact order of the events.
The U.S. Air Company and the Naval Forces have declared that the aircraft has slowed down the landing track and reached a nearby bay.
Some witnesses believe the plane has crossed the track.
U.S. National passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane reached a very small distance from the sun.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes also said that he and other passengers were able to cross the water, which reached the bridge, and to reach the emergency exits of the plane that is sinking.
He also said that the boaters panicked and fell and that he suffered a minor wound on his head.
The U.S. Naval forces said that the sailors who worked near to renovate a diver have failed to help, using a non-fly boat to transport people on the ground before the plane falls 30 meters below water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people died in the accident of some airlines registered in PNG in the last two decades, but none of them included an Air Niugini company's aircraft.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
Saturday, the prosecution closed the complaint with regard to the suspension of the trial for a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst in the U.S. Department of Justice, filed testimony for several hours as an expert expert in the information analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used his mobile phone records to focus on Quinton Tellis' actions at the age of 29, as well as his victims, Jessica Chambers, at the age of 19, on the night that he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night he was killed, this being in contradiction with his previous claims, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data came out that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was called in the witness box and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "had lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
The mobile phone records indicate that they were known for a week.
Rowlett stated that, shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis spread the text messages, calls and contact data of Chambers on his phone.
"He threw it out of his life," said Hale.
In accordance with the timetable, the defence will begin its final Sunday platoon.
The judge stated that he had proposed that the jury would decide at the end of that day.

Another color person?!
A widow in New York trial a couple for giving her a message after she received a "rasist" message.
A brother in New York tried to get a divorce for discriminatory reasons after he received a text message from his mother, claiming that he was “another person of color”.
The couple denied the fact that they were racist, claiming that she had given it in court for "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed surprise when she found out that her new grandfather, Giselle Maurice, was of color when she presented her first day of work in 2016.
"WOMAN! DO YOU HAVE A PERSOANCE OF CULOARE," wrote his wife, Plasco-Flaxman in a text message.
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent Maurice twice.
After considering the case, feeling betrayed, Plasco-Flaxman granted Maurice, saying that the grandfather, who is African-American, did not fulfil his duties properly and that he was expected to receive a native of the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for work day and sent home with Uber.
Now, she's given in court the couple to agree to grant and ask for a sum of $350 per day for six months, the period in which she had to live with it and carry out her business, despite the fact that this was done without a contract.
"I want to show them that they don't do such things," she said yesterday for the Post newspaper, adding, "I know it's a word of discrimination."
The couple denied the claims of being racist, saying it was a normal thing to grant Maurice, because they were afraid I could no longer trust her after they hung her.
"My wife sent her a wrong message.
He's not a racist person.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco, her husband, for the Post newspaper.
"But did you leave your children in the hands of a person whom you had sinned, even if it was a mistake?
The new-born child?
Let's be serious."
In view of the "extortion" process, Plasco stated that his wife would be born in two months and that she is in a "very difficult situation".
“Do you really want to fight a person in such circumstances?
It's not like that," added the bank investor.
While the process is under way, the public opinion accused the couple of socializing networks, judging them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's story editors were afraid that readers would not be able to identify with a resource that speaks, according to a new letter.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the paper, said the following things about writing: “It’s hard to put yourself in the skin of a person who reads it for the first time, before it’s published.
It's very funny now, after I saw that Paddington had a terrible success."
He further stated that his father, who was a cameraman for BBC before being inspired by a game plan to write the book for children, would have been optimistic about the rejection of his work, adding that the anniversary of the 60-year full-time publication of the books was a "long-term" after he died last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family”, she added that her father had a discreet pride about the success she enjoyed later.
"He was a very quiet man, and he didn't like to praise himself," she said.
"We, because Paddington was so real to him, was like having a child who had a success: you are proud of him, though it is not your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, it was always used to give Paddington his honor."
My daughter was dying, and I had to stay by the phone.
On the landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nisa, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad calls often to tell me it's very serious and doesn't think it's going to survive," Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I received a call from Nad telling me she's gonna die in the next two minutes and I have to get rid of her
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, "Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medications on her heart to continue pumping blood began to decrease and get out of her body.
Deaths shortly thereafter and the organs began to no longer function.
I had to stay there and wait, aware of everything that was happening.
I couldn't hate or dress because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, lying down after his daughter's death, got into the plane, along with other passengers, who didn't know what happened.
"No one knew," she said.
"I held my head down and the tears didn't stop crying.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I had a complex feeling of sympathy towards Nad.
I realized I needed love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two pregnant women spread various messages on a post to prevent suicides
Two women who lost their loved ones because they killed themselves trying to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys spread various messages on a post from the country of Galilee, many of which are motivated by phone numbers where people can call to receive support.
Sharon Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer depression and died at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Davis, 45 years old, lives in Lydney and says his son is going to be a promising cook with a mollusc smile.
"Everyone appreciates the smile.
They always said his smile changed your mood."
However, he quit his job before he died because he arrived at a very unhappy moment in his life.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his brother after his death.
Davis said, "I'm still thinking you're going to have a domino effect."
It created messages “to convey to people that I can call on someone or that I can talk to someone, even a friend.
Get out of here, you need to talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, Davies' friend for many years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old life partner, at least from his mother's death.
"He didn't tell me he wasn't feeling well or he's depressed," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, I noticed that it changed her attitude.
He was in a sad state in Christmas, when the children did their presents and he didn't even look at them."
She said that his death was a tremendous blow to them, but she had to overcome it: “It caused great pain within the family.
We're ruined.
But we have to go further and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in play, as a result of the start of the investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigations
"I thought that if I could get something similar to what he asked – an investigation on a limited period of time and reduced enlargement – I could have a small unit," said Jeff Flake on Saturday, adding that the commission is about to "disintegrate", on the basis of a joint block.
Why don't Kavanaugh and his supporters want a FBI investigation?
Their reticence is due to the whole of the time factor.
There are only five weeks until the 6 November elections - if, as it is suggested, the Republicans have poor results, their attempts to place him on the one who wants to win the election for the highest court in the country will be significantly weakened.
George W. Bush made all the calls to senators, to convince them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through which he met his wife, Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI concludes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to make the difference in case of equality and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea falls under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong came to power seven years ago, a South Korean parliamentarian said.
Park Byeong-seug, reading data from South Korea's Ministry of Unity, said that last year some 1,127 people fled the country, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were the stronger border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates understood by those who carry people illegally across the border.
The piano didn't make any public comment.
One vast majority of the refugees in the north are eventually offered a South Korean citizenship.
The Seoul officials state that more than 30,000 North Koreans have passed the illegal border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the protected powerful demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers illegal migrants more likely to flee than refugees and often repatriate them strongly.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still, in practice, in the war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, leaders of the two countries met in Phenian for some of the discussions they had held on the negotiations on denuclearization.
This took place after the historic meeting between US Presidents Donald Trump and Kim Jong-one from Singapore, when they agreed, in general, to collaborate for a Korean pen in the absence of nuclear weapons.
But Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States sanctions of lack of progress since then.
"If we can't trust the United States, we won't be able to trust our national security and, in such a situation, we won't be the first to defend ourselves unilaterally," Ri said in a speech addressed to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as being "stiric", stating that it is impossible to serve at the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the Democratic Minority in the Chamber of Representatives, described him as Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court as “stiric” and said his temper was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made his comments on Saturday, during an interview, at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't think of the fact that if there was a woman in this situation, it would have been declared "striking", Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's legal commission, which took place today.
Kavanaugh denied the charges that she would have sex with Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost silent and lost his voice because of the emotions, while discussing his family and school years.
He also explicitly condemned democracies within the Commission, calling charges against "a mass murder and coordinated murder", organised by angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said it is in the opinion that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve the Supreme Court, because it showed that he had a party character against the Democrats.
"I believe it is disqualified by the respective declarations and the way the Clinton family and democracy have been attacked," she said.
Pelosi was due to the subject when he was asked if he would try to stop Kavanaugh if it was confirmed and if the Democrats would win the majority in the Chamber of Representatives.
"I just want to say so: if you don't tell the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then it's not appropriate, not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court in which it is now," Pelosi said.
At present, Kavanaugh is a judge at the Court of Appeal of the Columbia District.
Pelosi added that, as a democracy, he is concerned about the possible decisions of Kavanaugh against the affordable law of concern or of the Roe Versus Wade case, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be raised.
"It is not the right time for a woman, a partner, to go to court and wait for us to say, "Wow! What wonderful!" said Pelosi.
And women have to hand it.
It's a justified diet, it's months and years of anger accumulated and can't talk without crying out.
"We cry when we're excited," Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, doesn't it?"
She continued: “I received a significant help from a woman who has an executive function, who told me that she was crying when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique according to which, when she was nervous and started to cry, she told the person she was talking to: “You might think I’m sad because you see me crying.
I'm nervous."
And then it goes on.
I've seen a great thing."
The complaints are allowed to eliminate anger, partly because they are fundamentally wrong.
One of the clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in a dominated office of men, where I started to cry because of an unexpressable rage, is that I was shot at by a woman older, a cool director before which I always felt a little afraid, and he took me to the house of the stairs.
"He should never see you crying," she said to me.
"I don't know you're angry.
I think you're sad and they'll be glad they caused you this feeling."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat in Congress of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential elections.
In 1987, when Hart was caught that he had an extra-conjugal relationship on a ship called Monkey Business and withdrew from course, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, he thought he had no reason not to even apply to the presidency.
"It wasn't a very good decision," she says laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the course, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone referred to the situation as "Alb as the Zjapada and the seven little ones."
Because the campaign was at the end, she was behind the fund-raising and swore she wouldn't get in the race if she couldn't earn $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
He found out that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to the men, they only gave him $250.
"How do they think I'm getting reductions?" she asked.
During the speech he announced that he would not officially launch a company, he was so affected by emotions – as a result of recognition for the people who supported him, the frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to draw money and to see voters in the place of delegates, but also the anger caused by gender discrimination – he lost his voice because of the emotions.
"You said I had a nerve crisis," Schroeder recalls about the reactions of the pressure to her face.
"You'd say one of my sponsors is Kleneex."
I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my funeral stone.
"The cry?"
How can Beijing benefit from the US-China trade war?
The greetings that announced the beginning of the US-China trade war have been overwhelming and, although it seems to be a long way to end it, the certs between the two countries could be useful for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued the first warning at the beginning of this year, by imposing taxes on key imports from China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important scaling took place this week with new taxes, which affected products worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds of esterline), applying in fact half of all the goods from China coming into the United States.
Beijing has been reimbursed every time, the most recent tax imposed between 5 and 10% for US products worth $60 billion.
China warned that it would respond to every hit by the United States and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will take a step back in the near future.
In order for Washington to withdraw, China has to agree with its demands, but dedication to the United States would be too humiliating for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that, if Beijing plays well, US pressures on trade war could support China in a positive way over a long period of time, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a fast political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic downturn in both countries would in fact be more dangerous than what has been suggested so far," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a group of experts.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, Minister for Foreign Affairs says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war that lasts for seven years.
During his speech from the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulalem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, conditions on the ground are more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the devastated areas of terrorists so that things can return to normal.
The existing conditions allow the voluntary return of refugees to the country where they were required to leave it because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at everyday life and their lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country in 2011 when the war broke out.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would be pleased to receive assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, it stressed that conditional assistance or assistance from countries sponsored by insurgents would not be accepted.
European team winning Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 after winning the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National from the city of Paris, France.
The United States has now recorded its sixth successful victory in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned to the first place after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn got 14.5 points, necessary to win the United States.
American old Phil Mickelson, who has made incredible efforts in most of the tournament, sent the first shot in the water at the 3rd floor of the 16th floor, down to Francesco Molinari's game.
The Italian golf player Molinari had an incredible performance in all the rehearsals, becoming one of the four players with a 5-0-0 result from the current tournament format, from 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost the game 5 and 4 in front of the player from the last place in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The first player in the world class, Dustin Johnson, lost the 2 and 1 games in front of Ian Poulter in England, which is probably his last game in Ryder's cup.
A veteran of Ryder's cup, who participated in eight editions, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the player in Europe with most winners, recording an average of 25.5 points throughout his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop.
It was a hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas that he chose me and that he believed in me.
I'm extremely happy that I was able to win again.
It's a team job and I'm glad I could be of help," Garcia said, excitedly, after European victory.
This presents to his cousin John Ram, who won Tiger Woods, an American golf legend at 2 and 1 games in the individual game, Sunday.
"I'm very proud that I beat Tiger Woods. I used to follow his games when I was a kid," said Rahm, aged 23.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 at Ryder's Cup.
A strange statistics for one of the best players of all times, who won 14 important titles, being over-exposed only by Jack Nicklaus.
All weekend, the American team threw a real effort on the golf field, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played an extraordinary game throughout the tournament.
US team captain Jim Furyk said after a devastating performance of his team: "I'm proud of them, they've even tried.
This morning, there were a few moments when I put pressure on the European team.
I've had a red fight.
Put the hat on Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
I'll work with the PGA of America and our Committee for Cupa Ryder and we'll go further.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We've got to give them the respect they deserve.
They played better than us."
News about the Red Sea: concentrations dropped in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report of the Commission on the Protection of the Fauna of Florida shows a general decline in the concentration of red for certain areas of the Tampa Gulf.
According to the Commission, uneven conditions of inflation are reported in the areas of the Pinnellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier committees – which suggest lower concentrations.
This abundance of red roses extends over an area of approximately 210 km of coast, from the north of the Pinellas Committee to the south of the Lee Committee.
Petiles can be found about 16 km along the Hillsborough committee, but in less places than last week.
The Red Sea has also been observed in the Pasco Committee.
The mean concentrations in or throughout the Pinnelas Committee were reported last week, as well as the lower concentrations in the Hillsborough Committee, the background concentrations to peaks in the Manatee Committee, the higher to peaks in the Sarasota Committee or within it, the centre to the Charlotte Committee, the bottom to peaks in the Lee Committee and the lower concentrations in the Collier Committee.
The irradiations of the respiratory cells in the Pinnellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier committees continue to be reported.
No cases of respiratory irritation have been reported in the northwestern United States of America last week.
