Ladies and gentlemen, they're worried that they're going to be covered with the carpets.
Some Members expressed concern about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of Parliament of Italy).
This concern was due to plans to change the name of the Assembly of Parliament of Italy.
Members throughout the political phase are concerned that this will sound ridiculous.
A member of the Working Party said his extended concern was "to do the same with the words Twp and Pwp".
For users outside Italy: In vowels, the word "twp" means "miss" and the word "pwp" means "precise".
One Plyde Member said that the extension was "not satisfied" and suggested alternative solutions.
A Wallos conservative stated that his extension was "a personal" regarding the change of name, but noted that the word MWP does not require much from the word "mapet".
In this context, the waal letter w is similar to the English version of Yörksair of the letter u.
The Parliamentary Commission, which is currently drawing up the draft amending the name, stated: "The final decision on any name to which Members are to be called will be a case of the Members' own".
The Law of the Government of Wales in 2017 gave the Parliament of Italy the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals which were widely accepted on behalf of the House as Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the title of Members, the Commission was called on the name 'Member of Parliament of Wales' or 'WMP', but the MWP option was the result of greater support in the public consultation.
Members are obviously proposing alternative options, but the attempt to achieve consensus may be a difficult case for Parliament's President, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the bill to change the name within the next few weeks.
The Law on Amendments will also include other changes in the functioning of the House, inter alia, rules of withdrawal from the mandate of the Member and the design of the Committees' system.
Members will decide in the final vote on the issue of their name during the discussion of the legislation.
The citizens of GDP are added to the resolution on the change in the name of the country
The voters will vote on the change in the country's name in the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The people's vote was called for in an attempt to resolve a conflict of decades with neighbouring Greece, which has its own jurisdiction called Macedonia.
Athens argues that the name of the northern part of it is undermining territorial views and has been re-responsive to its requests for EU and NATO integration.
Güorge Ivanof, President of the GDR, a war on the resolution on the change in the name, said he would not take account of the vote.
However, supporters of the resolution, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaef, claim that the change is just the price they have to pay for their accession to the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells have arrived as congregations in Harlem disappear
"People older than I talked to, say there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
Today, there is none of the two."
He said he understood the reason the bars disappeared.
"The world is socialized in a different way today," he said.
"The bars are no longer the salon of the neighborhood where the world starts regularly."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the assets will not remain as long as the officials hope "and soon or soon they will return to the point where they started".
The congregations, he added, can be replaced by numerous homes filled with people who will not be willing to help the refugee countries that have remained in the neighborhood.
"The corrupt majority of people who would buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and thus they will arrive at the day when all these churches will be completely closed, because it is impossible for all these people to move to these apartments to become members of the churches."
And the two churches were built by white churches before the Harlem Black Mother - the Metropolitical Community was founded in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The early Methodist church ceased in the 1930 ’ s.
A black church located in a nearby distance took possession of the building.
The property of St. Martin's building took up a black church under the education of John Howard Johnson, who advanced to a mosque in the 125th Street stadiums, a main commercial street in Harlem, which refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but Father Johnson's officers took the repair and ordered the van.
The educator David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and heir to the St. Martin Congregation, openly called the "Camps of the Poor."
The specialist who played the cartoon on July characterized it in some other way: "civilism" and "an anti-historical historical instrument".
Specialist Tiffany In of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first prince in the world to be played by black music, Denisio A. Lind, who was transferred to the largest prince in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Medielder said that St. Martin's church did not replace him.
What happens in the last few months in St. Martin is a complex story between architects and workers, some of whom were invited by the local leaders of the church, while others from the survey.
The directors - the governing body of the province, which is made up of the local leaders - sent to visit July a letter of concern that the visit "will endeavour to transfer the cost" to the body of the committees, despite the fact that this did not interfere with the reception of the leaders and workers sent by the church.
Some speakers expressed concern about the lack of transparency on the part of the inspection.
A 13-year prison sentence for civilians in California
Carcharia was attacked and wounded 13-year-old boy on the Sabbath during the siege of the city of California on the first day of the city, according to the authorities.
The attack was reported just before 7 p.m. near the Bicon Beats beach in the city of Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had made interviews with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the baby's screams asking for help and approached a group to get him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was just a little bit of excitement because he had a hard time, but then he realized he was crying, "Something touched me!
Something touched me!"
All the key was open," Hamel observed when he arrived at the place where the boy was.
"I called everyone out of the water: "There's a caricarium on the sea!" Hamel added.
The boy was transferred to the P.R. Hospital in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
The type of carcinogen responsible for the attack remains unknown.
Navigator Larry Jails said in the paper that the caricarium had been detected in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Jails added that the victim brings serious injuries to the upper part of the body.
The authorities prohibited access to the beach from Pointe Beach to Casabland to Suamis in Enzinita for 48 hours for reasons of research and security.
Jails noted that there are more than 135 species of carcinoma in the region, but most are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's projects impose pressure on the US cultural product market
The Sainsbury's are located with the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, putting painted sculptures against these multi-storeys, equipped with special staff.
In the context of the significant decline in the EU credit market, which continues to develop while sales of type of investment and household species indicate a fall, the largest interest rates will be tested in 11 situations across the country and will be extended to more situations if the transaction fails.
The investment in the customer sector comes as the supermarkets search for ways to fill the area in branches that have ever included televisions, small-scale ovens and household items.
The Sainsbury's said they would double their customer offer to 3,000 products, including companies such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also provide more space with letters with the company's logo, like these stations like Boots.
The Supermarket re-launchs its Boutique makeup series so that most products are vegan - something that the newest consumers always ask for.
In addition, the brand company The Fragrance Shop will try to have its products available in two Sainsbury's, the one that opened in Croddon, South London, last week and the other in Shelly Oak, in Bermiham later this year.
Electronic markets and the trend of the market for small quantities of food each day in local market mines mean that supermarkets should pay greater efforts to make the world visit them.
Mike Kup, director of the Sansbury's, said that outlet situations will always look more like multi-storeys, as Supermarques are trying to compete with Aldi and Lidl outlets with more other services than food.
The Sainsbury's placed outlet Argos in hundreds of cases, while also introduced some Habitats as they bought the two olives two years ago, a fact that supported the sale of pancakes and placed more favourable prices.
The previous attempt of Supermarquet to rejuvenate the sections of culinary and medicinal products has failed.
The Sainsbury'ss were trying to negotiate with the Boots at the beginning of the year 2000, but the cooperation ended after an operation on how to distribute the profits from the drug systems at the Allisian supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury's sold the pharmaceutical company that you owned with 281 properties in Celesio, owned by Lloyds Pharmacy, over £125 million, three years ago.
He said Lloyds would play its own role in the project, adding an extended range of multi-stakeholder companies, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four situations.
Paul Mills-Hicks, trade director of Saninsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and feel of our raffles in order to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in a highly trained staff who will be available to offer advice.
Our company has been designed to cover every need, while the smooth environment and the comfortable locations mean that we are no longer a possible destination for customers who challenge the traditional market method."
Peter Jones: a surplus after Holly Willowby's withdrawal from the 11 million £ agreement
The entrepreneur of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, is exhausted after the removal of the Holly Willobie Telepathy from the 11 million £ agreement with the company of lifestyle, so that it can be concluded in the new agreement with Marks and Spencer and the ITV.
Willobie doesn't have time for the real estate company Truly.
Their business was similar to Goop's company in Guineth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old exhibit "This Morning" announced in Instagram her decision to quit.
Holly Willowby made an exception to the main competitors of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, leaving their successful lifestyle business at the last moment, in order to devote itself to its new great agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became obsolete when the gold girl of television was accepted during a third-party conference at the central offices of his sovereignty in Marlo, Bakihamsair, that because of the new agreements - up to £1.5 million - she would no longer have enough time to be available to the company of type and sponsor Truly.
The company was similar to the Goop company of Guineth Paltrow and seemed to double the assets of Wiilobi, which is estimated to reach £11 million.
After the 37-year-old willobby in Instagram announced that he was going to leave Truly, Jones moved out of Britain to some of his former residences.
According to some sources: "Truly was far from Holly Willowby's top priorities.
Its long-term future, its income for the next decade.
Its decision to reject it was the exception of all those involved in the undertaking.
No one could believe what happened to the Third, so close to the presentation.
There is a full stock of products in the Central Offices in Marlou ready to be sold."
The experts consider that the rejection of the "This Morning" emission show, which is combined with the most commercial features of Britain, could cost millions to the company due to the increasing investment in products from mills and barley to clothes and household items, as well as further delays in its presence.
And that can mark the end of a long friendship.
Holly Willowby, mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin's husband maintain close friendship with Jones and Tara Cape's husband for ten years here.
Willowby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the President in March.
The couples spend time with his breaks, and Jones maintains a 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoby is going to become the main person in the M&S camps and replace And McPartlin in the presentation of the "I'm A Celebrity" in the ITV.
A source from Jones' close environment said last night, "We wouldn't want to discuss his professional cases."
We were strong and then we fell in love.
He was concerned about the criticism received by the media for a comment that some would consider it inappropriate for a president, as well as for his stand against the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trab make so many concessions?
Drabb said he's missing the telephony.
"I didn't give up anything."
He stated that Kim was interested in a second meeting, after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was welcomed by Trab as a major step towards the abolition of North Korea.
However, negotiations on waste disposal have been delayed.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korean diplomat Ray Young-Ho told the world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea sees no "responsive answer" from the United States after the first North Korean deployment.
On the contrary, he stressed that the United States continues to apply sanctions aimed at exerting pressure.
Trab kept a much more comfortable attitude in his speech.
"We're going very well with North Korea," he said.
"It's too much to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
We have now built this excellent relationship."
He stated that his efforts to improve his relations with Kim gave positive results - the end of the fire tests, the release of the figures and the return of the other American soldiers to their homes.
While he supported his inconsistencies in his statements about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to have a 'presidential' floor, but instead of having 10,000 people sitting outside the hall because they couldn't come in, we would have only 200 people here," Trab said, looking at the crowd in front of him.
tsunamis and tsunamis in Indonesia pollute an entire island, leaving thousands of dead bodies in their path
In the area of the camp in Lobok, for example, it was announced that there would be no need for assistance from foreign non-governmental organizations.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lobok's population was exposed, there was no national destruction, a necessary condition for the award of international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is very difficult," said Mr. Subung.
While the Save the Children organisation is preparing a group that will travel to Paul, it is not yet known whether the foreign staff will be able to work on site.
Mr Sutopo, a representative of the National Natural Disasters Service, said that the Indonesian authorities had assessed the situation in Palau to determine whether it would allow international organizations to contribute assistance.
Due to data from border controls that frequently affect Indonesia, the country remains extremely unrecognizable against the organ of nature.
While they've been building shelters for tsunamis in Athens, it's not the same in other rectangles.
The apparent lack of warning series for tsunamis in Pala, even after warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of such lives.
In the best case, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters cover even more administrative areas.
A large hospital that had set up in Lobok to hold the victims of the siege leads to Paul, but they will need at least three days to arrive at the location of the new disaster.
President Joko Woodonto was at the centre of the campaign's electoral centre to improve Indonesia's structured infrastructures and provided simple money for the construction of roads and roads.
However, there is a lack of funding for Mr Joko's administration, before the next year's re-election.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from the persistent obvious trends in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been found as groups of Christians and Muslims fight on the streets, using swords, toxes and bells, as well as other automatic weapons.

The tragic calculation of deaths from the tsunami in Indonesia reaches 832
The calculation of the deaths after the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia is 832, according to the declarations of the country’s natural disaster service prior to the sun.
Many people were trapped in the walls of the buildings that fell after the 7.5 degrees that struck the Paris area and created a 6-metre fence, said the service representative, Sutopo Puruyo Nugorho, at a kind of meeting.
The city of Paul, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the ruins of the damaged buildings.
The police took 32 years, suspect, after killing a woman with a knife.
A murder investigation began following the discovery of a woman's body at Birkengent, in Mercheind this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 B.C.E. with injuries from swords at Grayson Mose in John Stret, while a 32-year-old man was gathered as a witness to the murder.
The police asked the locals who saw or heard something to put it in the police.
Policeman Brian Oheigan said: "The investigation is at an initial stage but I would like to address an invitation to anyone who was in the neighborhood around John Strit and saw or heard something wonderful to communicate with us.
I would also like to address an invitation to anyone, especially the drivers, who may have written something on the plans from the dashcam cameras to communicate with us as they can have the information that is vital to our research."
A police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkengent and found in a building.
This evening, friends who believe that they may know the woman went to the crime scene to ask questions about the location she was found this morning.
Research is in progress as the police said it is in the process of informing closer relatives.
A guide who lives in Grayson Mous, trying to return to his apartment, was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He remained silent when he discovered what had happened.
The owners were informed that they may have to spend hours before allowing them to return to their homes.
A cop comes to tell a man that the whole area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman showed up at the stage.
They've always been saying "it's scary."
At 2 p.m., two police stations were located in the police station and one outside.
The police were standing outside the hall and watching the crowd.
Any information you have is requested to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crimestopers line at 0800 555 111 for the case 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's message to Parliament becomes the last reminder of the "recovery of history"
His exaggeration would be a fundamental right for the Taliban to destroy many of England's cultural and religious projects by its prominent four-year-old supporters.
However, Syllogos Cromwell described Mr. Crick's proposal as "anonysity" and "a desire to re-enhance history".
John Goldsmith, president of Crimwell's College, said: "In this debate on the elimination of goods, it was unlikely that the form of Oliver Cromwell would not be targeted outside of Westminster's Doctors.
The ecnocraticity of England's civil wars was neither banned nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps a member of Cromwell’s family was killed for the actions of Tom’s predecessor in the past century.
The excellent innovation of Cromwell by Ser William Hamo Thornicroft is a feature of his image in the 19th century and part of the history of a personality that many believe is worth a price tax.
Mr. Goldsmith said in The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromogle is still viewed by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a representative of the House against external pressures, in his case, of course of neutrality.
The fact that this is a completely accurate case is the subject of an open historical debate.
The only thing that is certain is that conflicts in the middle of the 17th century have shaped the subsequent development of our nation and Cromwell is a recognized personality that represents one side of the administration.
His achievements as Lord Prostate are also valuable and memorable."
Hoiros-killer hurts mortal Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a dog on a market in South-East China, according to local news reports.
The man, who was only known as "Waan", was found with a broken artery in a blood tank near a gas station in the Liupanswii market in the province of Guítsow, South China announced Morning Post on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, he is preparing to administer vaccines in pigs in Jining in the Chinese province of China, China.
He must have traveled with his brother from nearby June on Tuesday to sell 15 chickens on the market.
The next morning, his brother found him dead and discovered the door of a nearby apartment.
He said there was a large Russian dog with blood in his mouth.
The examination of the doctor confirmed that the dog that was married to 227 pounds had injured the farmer fatally, according to his report.
"My brother's feet were dead and crushed," said the brother, known as "Wow," according to Guyingang's evening newspaper.
The security camera plans show Uwan to enter the market on Thursday 4:40 p.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man doesn't belong to Owen or his brother.
One market official stated in the evening that the dog has been placed in clubs to avoid reaching anyone else, while the police collected evidence in the attack scene.
Wean's family and market authorities are going to negotiate some compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of dog attacks in humans have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a dog attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, seriously harming the man.
Ten years ago, a thousand 295 miles [295 km] ago, a farmer in Italy threw a farmer over the tractor when the farmer’s wife bit the animal to keep it away.
After the incident in which a farmer from Oregon was beaten by his dogs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not susceptible, but the taste of blood can act as a "injury".
"They've just got toys.
They're small, very strange plastics... they don't want to hurt.
We should just show them proper respect," he said.
The remains of the Russian peninsula are going to bring extensive floods in the South American countries
According to the estimates, Typhoon Rosa is sick as it moves over the coolest water masses of the northern regions of Mexico.
However, Typhoon Roussian will bring ecliptic floods in North Mexico and the South America in the coming days.
The strength of the Russian steam engine reached 85 mph, being Category 1, at 5 m East hour, the sun and found 385 miles west of Punta Ewheña, in Mexico.
Typhoon Rosa is expected to move north of the Sun.
In the meantime, a low-pressure area of the winds has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and to move east to the West Coast of the United States. As Typhoon Roza approaches South California on Monday, a tropical storm will bring a change in life to the north in South America.
The Russians will bring up 25 percent floods in areas of Mexico Monday.
Then, a change in fluid in combination with the area of low pressure near will create extensive strong floods in the South in the coming days.
Local rains of 2.5 to 10 per cent will cause dangerous floods, floods and possible flooding.
Long-term warming will lead to rainfall rates approaching 5 to 7.5 percent of the time in the area, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
Sources of 5 to 10 percent are expected at locations in the South-East, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Plums are likely to cause serious damage to the surfaces due to the different nature of the alterations.
It is recommended that you avoid any movement with your feet in the background in view of the threat of a change of background.
Strong floods can turn the rivers into hormonal rivers and the rivers will cause local floods and floods.
The low-pressure area will create some powerful local windfalls at locations in the Southern California area.
A total drop rate above 1 per cent is possible, which can cause small flow of contiguouss and ostracism on the roads.
This will be the first case of the cold season in the region.
A number of divergent tropical winds will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the apparent spreads will be late Monday and Wednesday.
The strong floods will spread into the For Corners area on Tuesday and will last until Tuesday.
In October some intense changes in temperature will be observed throughout the United States as temperatures in Arctic decline, but in tropical areas there will be a lot of high.
Sometimes this leads to very intense changes in temperature in nearby areas.
A characteristic example of intense temperature differences between Central America was observed on Sunday.
It was marked by a difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and the Army, Nebraska and between St. Louis and De Mon, Iowa.
In the next days, constant high temperatures will be observed and re-examined.
In most of the Central and Eastern America, October is expected to start with high temperatures at 27 °C from the Eastern fields to parts of the South-East.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 °C on Wednesday, about 5 degrees above average.
According to our long-term forecast for the period, there are many possibilities to observe temperatures above average in the Eastern United States until the first half of October.
More than 20 million televised Brad Kavano's hearing
More than 20 million televisors followed the ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States of America, the Friday and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which took place in the 1980s, Christine Blazi Ford, on six television networks.
In the meantime, political exclusion continued, with the television networks to stop the regular flow of the agenda for the last time on Friday: the agreement by the Commissioner of Arizona Jeff Fleck to conduct a week's research by the FBI in relation to the categories.
Ford told the Russian Justice Commission that it is 100 percent sure how at a party when he was a student of law, Kevino was attacked while he was beaten and tried to get her clothes off.
Cavanno, in a loaded statement, declared it to be 100 percent sure that something did not happen.
According to Nielsen's estimates, it is possible that more than 20.4 million televised audiences could be observed on Friday.
The company submitted the average television on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC networks.
The numbers were not immediately made available for other networks that transmitted the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen is often difficult to calculate the number of television providers monitoring a transfer from offices.
For us to see this television in the right ranges, it is a common proportion of what is being monitored by a football game of the left or the end of the Oscar season.
The Fox News channel, in which journalists strongly supported the appointment of Cabano, was advanced with an average of 5.69 million televisions during the entire day of hearing, according to Nielsen.
Secondly, ABC has 3.26 million televisors.
CBS was followed by 3.1 million, NBC by 2.94 million, MSNBC by 2.89 million and CNN by 2,52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high and after the hearing.
Fleck was shown to be a pro-competitor in the work of Friday.
Following the declaration of the Republican Metropath that it will vote in favour of Cuba, CNN and CBS cameras signed the Friday morning to test him as he tried to enter the elevator to hear from the Justice Commission of Russia.
He stood with the look down for a few minutes as he was tested, living on the television at CNN.
"I'm standing here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
He said, "You have power when so many women are weak."
Flyck said that his office had made statements and, before closing his elevator doors, he would have said more to the Commission's hearing.
All cable television and transmission networks were closed a few hours later, the vote of the Committee on Justice of Georgia on the promotion of Cabano's accession to the whole of Russia to vote.
However, Felix stated that he would only do so if the FBI investigated the complaints against the petition next week, something requested by the minority of the Republicans.
Flyck was put in a part of the conversation with his friend, the publisher of the Democratic Party, Chris Konces.
After discussions with Küns and some other Russians later, Flyck was dismissed.
Fleck's choice was valid because it was obvious that the Republicans would not concentrate on the votes for the approval of Cabano without conducting an investigation.
President Trab asked the FBI to carry out an investigation on the charges against Gabon.
British Prime Minister May accuses its critics of playing games with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused the beneficiaries of the European Union's eviction plans that they "play political games" with the future of Britain and underestimate national interest in a meeting with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Tereza May is arriving at the Council of the Conservative Party in Berlin, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
At another meeting with her own in the newspaper's front door, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson is critical of the Czechs project for Brexit, saying that the proposal to impose taxes between Britain and the EU was "completely unfair".
Firewright Sims: The police took Captain Dadeon Samson for the murder of the player in LSU
The police took a look at the death bombing of White Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Diane Simson, aged 20, was arrested and held in jail in a second-class murder category, according to the police department of Baton Rouz.
The authorities have in their hands a video from Simson's complex, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the checkout.
The police placed the glasses in the crime scene and declared that they had placed a sign from Simson's DNA, according to WAFB, in cooperation with CBS.
After Simson's response, the police said he admitted that he had hurt Wade fatally.
His insurance was limited to $350,000, according to his lawyer.
According to the preliminary report by East Paton Roussian doctor who had been killed on Friday, death was the injury of a bullet in his head and throat.
The Ministry has appointed a special working group of the police, the police station, the police forces of the South University and the citizens of the region to assist in the collection investigation.
LSU sports director Joy Alleva welcomed the local law enforcement authorities for "relianced investigation and enforcement of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
Four hundred and fifty-eight feet [1.58 m] higher than Baton Rouss, where his father, Wayne, also played LSU basketball.
It had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
On Friday morning, the leader of the LSU Wyatt's team's basketball team said the team is "conceited" and "in shock situation" from the death of Weide.
"We're always worried about situations like this," said Wade.
Explosions of the Fascist Explosion in the City of Mexico
The eruptions of the Fascist fortress from the Popokatéttel River reached the southern vicinity of Mexico’s original.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexican residents to stay away from the airport, after the activity in the state reached its peak, with 183 emissions of water and waste within 24 hours.
The Centre was monitoring various indications and small sequential data.
Images in social networking show a cross-over of cars covered with a few roofs in the vicinity of Mexico City, such as Sochimiko.
The geothermals observed an increase in the activity of the plant at 45 miles (72 km) east of the first time in September 2017.
The exhibition, known as Don Gogoo, has been active since 1994.
Police forces are confronted with Catalan autonomouss in view of the vote on independence
Six people were gathered in Barcelona on Saturday after a meeting of exhibitors in favour of independence with the class recovery units, as thousands participated in the demonstrations for the first year from the vote on the resignation of the city of Catalonia.
A group of masked exhibitors for independence, which were combined with the restoration units of the class, threw eggs and bags into the mud, creating snowy snowfalls in the streets that are usually closed by tourists.
Groups were also noted later during the day with the police to use their clubs to create the complexes.
For hours, groups of supporters of the independence of Catalonia called the slogan "We're not sorry, we don't forget" against groups of demonstrators for the unity of the country they called "I live in Spain".
Fourteen people were observed with microtraumatics marked during the demonstrations, according to the local type.
The submissions remain high in the region which supports independence one year after the proclamation of the October 1st resolution as illegal by Madrid, which, however, is derived from the autonomous Catholics.
The corrupt majority of voters chose independence, even though the approach was low with those who stood against independence to push the resolution.
According to the Catholic authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year after police authorities tried to stop voting at the electoral centres in the area where violent complications were mentioned.
Groups in favour of independence have created a ban on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for national police.
The event was carried out in other ways, and it had to be changed differently.
Narcis Termas, 68 years old, an electrician who participated in demonstrations in favour of his wife’s independence, said he no longer had hopes of winning her independence.
"We've lived one of our brightest moments lately.
I saw my parents with great joy that they wanted to vote, but now the situation is stable," he said.
Despite the fact that they noted a victory of vital importance even though limited in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties for independence were forced to maintain their power year, with many of their most famous leaders being self-determined or held in expectation of their role in the organisation of the resolution and the renewed declaration of independence.
John Puts, a 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded his motion for police demonstrations, said that the conflicts were fed by politicians and both sides of the army.
"The intensity is rising ever more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Zunkera, one of the nine Catalan leaders who were detained last year, announced his appeal to the European elections for the next year.
"My candidateship in the European elections is the best way to complain about the suspension of democratic values and the pressure we have received from the Spanish Government," he said.
London: Meeting men after car hire in a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were gathered after repeated car rental in London.
The incident took place in Bolingard Cresent on Thursday about 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Bloomings said damages were caused in the streets and the same building.
It may also have been noticed that a fire in the car has occurred at some point.
Mengka's press won in Livington won 1-0 against the Rangers.
Dolly Mengka's first golf for Livington guaranteed victory
Previously on Livington, he got rid of the Reeders by charging Steven Gerard the second year of his 18-year-olds as a manager of the Imbrogs team.
Dolly Mengka's press made the difference as Gary Holt's side changed the level with Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's team remains without a victory outside the stage in this season's campaign and faces the Harts, who have the eight-dimensional front, next Sunday.
Before this game, the Reinzers celebrate Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Friday.
Livington in the middle continues to be reluctant to play her in six games in her class, with the main procurator Holt that he hasn't liked anything since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livington misses opportunities against visitors
Holt's team should've taken the lead long before he's scored, with her ability to bring the Rangers into a difficult position.
Scott Robinson took the lead and decided to get there a little before the end, but Alan Lithcow gave up his effort to cut Craig Halcett's head away from the end.
The farmers allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could assign visitors to free prints and candles.
And that's how the important coal came.
Reinzers could not prevent a free strike, and Livington did the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to send the ball to Menga, who took the step and stole it from the center of the area.
Until that point, the Reinzers had ruled in the possession of the ball, but they found undisputed the protection of the landers, and the final camp of Liam Kelly did not face difficult situations.
This form continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos removed the ball from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's old man was pulled off of Reinzer's Alain McGregor's terminal, and Lithcow's foot came out on another free hit in Livingstone.
There were many pitches in the area of Livington and were constantly running away, while two pins were asked - after opening the ball from Halquet against the supplementary player Glen Mintelton and one hand - who were rejected.
"Excellent game" from Livington - analysis
Alsander Lamont from BBC Scotland in the field of Tony McCaronne Arena
Thematic performances and results for Livington.
All of them were extremely excellent, exceeding the expectations of this immoral course.
The style of the game and their personality changed at least after their return to top form, but the signs should also be given to the Holt for the encouragement he gave to the team with his approval.
His team had so many heroes.
President Halket was excellent, returning an extremely organized defense, while Mengka kept Connor Goldson and Joey Ourell in custody throughout the game.
The Rangers were not inspired by it.
As good as they were in the past under the direction of Gerard, they did not respond to these standards.
The last game was missing - only once they were able to pass the soil protection, and this is a warning campaign for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the department.
Anaemic emotions at the reception of Erdogan in Colombia
The climate was good on Saturday (September 29th) at a meeting of Turkey's and Germany's leaders for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's second visit to Germany, which was aimed at restoring relations with NATO partners.
They had come to a stand on issues such as human rights, freedom of type and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Colombia to start a new huge jam.
The city welcomes the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
The police prevented the concentration of 25,000 people in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters turned to see their president close.
Hundreds of speakers against Erdogan - many of whom Kurdish origins have also given today, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The ruling of the exhibitors reflects the questionable nature of a visitor who is treated by some Turks as hero and others as judges.
Road accident in Datford: death of a motorcycle after a car crash
A driver lost his life in a car crash in London.
The accident took place near the intersection of the Bested Street and Evelin Street roads, a multi-pronged road to Datford, in the easternmost part of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and the nurses of the hospital tried to help, but the man lost his life on the ground.
The conflict was noted a few months after a similar incident where a driver hit and killed a driver, who lost his life on the Cylter Street road, some 1.6 miles [1.6 km] away from the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitical Police stated that the authorities are making efforts to identify the man and inform their closest relatives.
The roads have been closed and the roads of the buses have been destroyed, while the guides have been given instructions to avoid the area.
Long Lartine Prisons: Six police officers were injured in complexes
Six police officers were injured in injuries caused by high-security men in prisons, according to the statements of the Prisons Directorate.
Trawls were thrown into the prisons of This Magnificent Long Lardin in Westernshire about 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still in progress.
Special police forces "Tornado" have been returned to deal with obstacles involving eight prisoners and who have been exposed to a party.
The police were observed with microtracies in the face during the complex.
A representative of prisons said: "A specially trained staff has managed to deal with the incident in the prisons of this Magnificent Long Laartin.
Six members of the staff were diagnosed with injuries.
We do not resort to violence in our prisons, and we make clear that those responsible will be subjected to police authorities and may impose a greater penalty."
In the prisons of this Magnificent Long Lattin, more than 500 prisoners are detained, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison administration was located in a hospital after an attack by a prisoner.
In October last year, the rehabilitation units were called into prison to be severely affected during which members of the staff were attacked with billion dollars.
Typhoon Roza threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with tropical rain forests (the areas with drought may benefit)
It is rare to touch Arizona, but that is precisely possible to happen at the beginning of the next week, as the remains of the Roza Typhoon will cross the eastern parts of the river, bringing floods into their midst.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued an extensive advance warning of floods for Monday and Wednesday from West Arizona to the south and eastern Nevada, North California and Yuta, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagastaf, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Typhoon Rosa is expected to pass right over Phoenix on Wednesday, where it will arrive late Monday with rain.
Fonix's National Meteorological Service commented on her tweet that only "ten tropical cycles have remained in a changing state of shock or low barometers at less than 200 miles from Fonix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a typhoonian in less than 40 miles away from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the U.S. National Centre of Typhoons provide for a rise of from 2 to 4 inches, with a single flow volume up to 6 inches in the Amazon Rim of Arizona.
In other regions of the South-East Countries, including the Central Walls and the Great Basins, it is possible to mark peaks of up to 1 to 2 inches, with a probability of single total rainfall up to 4 inches.
For areas not at risk of floods, the rain that Roza brings can be a blessing, as the area is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, a part of this drought is expected to be productive, as the South American countries today are experiencing harsh conditions.
According to the U.S. Intelligence Observatory, more than 40 percent of Arizona is facing at least a severe drought, which is the second highest category of drought," said weather.com.
First, Typhoon Roza will arrive at the stable in the Amazon Bay California of Mexico.
Maintaining the focus of the storm, on the morning of Sunday, Rosa will be 385 miles south of Mount Eugenia of Mexico with a maximum of 85 miles per hour and will move north at 12 miles per hour.
The bridge will meet more colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore be weakened.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive at the capital in Mexico with a sudden rise in the morning or in the evening.
An intense flooding in areas of Mexico may be observed, which will cause a significant risk of floods.
"Average total rainfall levels from 3 to 6 inches from the Bacha California to the North Sun, which may reach up to 10 inches", according to weather.com.
Then, Rosa will be guided north by crossing Mexico as a troupe again and will arrive at Arizona's borders early in the morning as a relatively low barometer, which will then pass through Arizona to reach South Jutta on Wednesday night.
"The main risk expected by the Russian typhoon or its lists is the very intense famine in Bacha California, the North Sun and the South American States," said the US National Centre for Typhoonism.
These floods are expected to cause dangerous heavy floods and tsunamis in the mountains and inland regions.
Place at Minsommer Norton: Four arrests for the death penalty
Three fugitives and a 20-year-old were gathered as eyewitnesses of a suicide attempt after the discovery of a 16-year-old who suffered from sword wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in Minsommer Norton's Exelsier Teras area, about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he remained in a "firm" condition.
A 17 - year - old, two 18 - year - olds and a 20 - year - old met during the night in the Rantstock area, reported the police to Evon and Sommerset.
The police call any person who may have recorded in a video on his cell phone what happened.
Trab says Kevin "lived the evil and the anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote in favour of Judge Cabano is a vote to reject the arbitrary and executive rules of the Democratic Party," Trab said at a meeting in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trab stated that the Cubans "lived the evil and the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the process of demonstrating it as a candidate.
Cavanno set up at Congress on Friday, refused charges and apparently moved by Christine Blaise Ford's allegations that she had been sexually assaulted ten years ago when she was pregnant.
Ford also sat in front of the audience for her claims.
The President said on the Sabbath that "the American people saw the size, quality and courage" of Cabano on that day.
"The vote on the confirmation of the candidateship of Judge Cabano is one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a legal with an excellent public service," said the group of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to the candidateship of Cabano, while speaking about the importance of the participation of the Republicans in the inter-elections.
"We have five weeks of one of the most important choices in our life.
I'm not a candidate, but it's actually like I am," he said.
"That is why I travel all the way to support excellent candidates."
Trab said the Democrats are on the mission of "resistance and ban".
The first important procedural vote in Russia on the independence of the Republic of Gabon is expected to take place later on Friday, said to the CNN a more helpful control of the leadership of the Republican Party.
Hundreds of people were killed by tsunamis and tsunamis in Indonesia, and the total number of deaths is expected to increase
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were expelled from the giant tribes that conquered the shores, when a great earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Solauese of Indonesia, the authorities declared the Kyria.
Hundreds of people had been assembled for a festival at the beach of the city of Palais on Friday, when six - foot - high peaks approached the grave of the surrogate, passing many to death and destroying everything in their way.
The tsunami came after 7.5 Richter.
"When the threat to tsunamis was exposed yesterday, the world was still on the beach and did not immediately stop, so it was hit by it," said Sutopo Pórjo Nugroho, representative of the Indonesian BNPB disaster management service, in an update to Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, carjacked, wood, houses, hit everything on the ground," said Nugrocho, adding that the tsunami had travelled to the ocean at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people dug into trees to swim out of the snow and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerobics published by the disaster management service show many damaged buildings and buildings, towers that have been damaged and destroyed and a shelter surrounded by water.
The shipments continued to hit the coastal town on Saturday.
The injuries were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Service (BPPT) reported that the energy released from the vast Persian Gulf was about 200 times more powerful than the individual bomb that fell in Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s geography, which is at the end of a zenomi can increase its size, said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and reported that hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
He said that victims were found trapped under the walls of the damaged buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 ignored.
Nukroho stated that the victims and the damages may be larger along the 300 km north of Palu, in a region called Dongala, which is closer to the centre of the siege.
The communications systems "was completely lost and there's no information" from Dongkala, he said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," said Mr. Stairs in his statement, adding that his staff and volunteers are directed to the areas they have visited.
"It's already about a tragedy and it can get worse," he said.
He was critical of the Service on the Sabbath because he did not report that the tsunami had struck Paul, even though according to officials the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In a technical video reported on in social networking, a man on the top floor of a building is heard shouting a panic while trying to warn people on the street about the coming tsunami.
In a few minutes, a water tank approaches the shore, passing houses and cars.
Reuters was not able to verify the visibility of the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a great cut in the stream, which also destroyed communications in Paul’s vast area, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts by the authorities.
The army started sending transport aircraft with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the missing continue to need unencumbered food and other basic types of first need.
The city's airport has just opened up to contribute to the healing efforts and will remain closed until October.
He's been planning a visit by President Joko Windonto to the concentration centers in Palo on Sunday.
The tsunami victims in Indonesia exceed 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although the staff of the World Vision organization from Dongkala managed to arrive safely in the city of Palu, where workers found refuge in caves located at the front of their office, passing through disaster scenes on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some medical teams have taken the heavy responsibility to initiate the recovery process of the wounded, some complain that it is not a burden to foreigners, especially experienced workers in the field of relief to travel to Paul.
In accordance with the regulations of Indonesia, the flow of funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin if the location of an interest is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It continues to be a disaster at the rule level," said Auliya Ariani, a representative of the Indonesian Army.
"When the government says it is a national disaster, we can address an application for international assistance, but there is no relevant decision yet."
As the second day after the earthquake and tsunami in Paris passed, friends and family who continue to miss out still hope that their loved ones will be the miracle that will make the story of these natural disasters less spectacular.
On Saturday, a little boy was fired by a signature.
On Sunday, the healers released a woman who had been trapped under the bed for two days, along with her mother's dead body.
Genton Subanton, the founder of the national team of the Indonesian elite, had trained two of the missing athletes for the Asian Agabus, who had been completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people in the Roa Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Madatzi, were his students.
"As an old man in the middle of the armed band, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Grenton left how, when the news about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the community of the occupied coasters, he began to send unfavourable messages to his opponents at Paul’s festival on the beach.
However, the indication on his messages was a gray symbol "n", rather than two blues.
"I think this means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Stealers spent $26,750 on the self-containing machine in Newford on the Levy.
On Friday morning, prisoners spent $26,750 from Brink's staff operating an ATM machine in Newport on the Levy, according to a Newport Police Department-type report.
The driver of the vehicle had exhausted an ATM machine to the respiratory system and was ready to deliver other money, said police officer Dennis Macarty.
While he was busy, another man "came running behind Brink's staff" and stole a bag of money that was intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects leave the scene, according to the report, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the event.
Anyone who has information about their identity should contact Newport's police, calling at 859-292-3680.
Make West: The rapper changes his name to Yye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Yee.
Following the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The one who is knowingly known as Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, has been listening here for a long time to the Chinese Yee and has used this fake name as a title for his album, which circulated June.
The change was due to its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to present the new album entitled Yandhi.
Instead of the show, the singer Arina Grande, who had canceled her appearance for "sympathetic reasons", said the author of the show.
In addition to being a summary of the professional name he uses today, West had in the past stated that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think the word 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, which means "you," said West last year, in a discussion on his album title with the radio producer Big Boy.
So it's me, it's us, it's us.
My name changes from Kenya, which means "the only one," to Ya, which is just a reflection of the good, the bad, our own, everyone.
The album is probably a reflection of who we are."
He's one of the many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sin Cobbs is known by various names, such as Paf Dandy, P. D. or D., but he announced a year that his names were Lav and Brader Lave.
A former West co-operative, the U.S.A., is also satisfied with the use of his name with or without letters and capital letters.
The elected President of Mexico is determined not to use the army against the citizens
Mexican elected President Andros Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn that he will never use military violence against citizens, as the country nears the 50th anniversary of a terrible student massacre.
Lopez Obrador was promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza Square that "he will never use the army to force the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the armed forces fired at a peaceful show in the square, killing 300 people, during a period when the left-wing student movements were gaining fame throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador was committed to supporting new Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those who study and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities would lead young people to criminal charges.
The US should double funding for technical wisdom
As China is more active in the field of technical intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on research in this field, says the investor and professional in the field of technical intelligence, which has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This statement is added to various parts of the US government's communication on technical intelligence, since the US does not have a fully official strategy for technical intelligence.
In the meantime, China has already presented its plan to become the first country in the world in innovation in matters of technical understanding until 2030.
"The duplication of the research budget for technical intelligence would be a good principle, given that all other countries lack so much of the US and we strive to make the next important discovery in the field of technical intelligence," Li said.
The duplication of the budget could double the chances of taking a country to the United States the next major achievement in the field of technical awareness, Li said at his meeting with the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book entitled "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (The superpowers of technical intelligence: China, Silicon Baley and the new world order) circulated this month from the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt issues, is the Director of the Synoving Ventures, who has invested in one of the top companies in China, Face+.
In the '80s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in a professional intelligence system that won the best American player Otello, while later he was an executive director of Microsoft Research and president of Google's annex in China.
Li acknowledged the importance of previous U.S. government technology negotiations, such as the DARPA R & D Emergency Prevention Service, and was discussed when the next event will be held to identify the following observers.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the best of the Academic Area, it's companies," he said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have taken students from universities to work on technical intelligence issues in recent years.
Li claims that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to support its efforts in the field of technical intelligence.
"I believe that an automatic green card should be offered to teachers' diplomas in technical understanding," he said.
The National Council of China issued a Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Crimeal Sciences in July 2017.
The National Institute of Natural Sciences of China provides funding for people in academic institutions such as the National Institute of Sciences and other government agencies share money with American researchers, but the quality of the academic project in China is lower, Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Ministry of Defence established a Joint Centre for the Lawgiver, which would include partners from the business and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of an Chosen Committee on the Lawgiver.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 million in an initiative called AI Next.
The U.S. National Institute of Sciences invests more than $100 million a year in research in the field of technical intelligence.
In the meantime, no progress has been made here for months in the legislation of the United States with the aim of creating a National Security Commission for the Armed Forces.
The citizens of the GDR are taking a resolution to decide whether to change the name of the country
The people of the PDA participated in the Sunday resolution to decide whether the country would become a "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a movement that would have been in conflict with Greece for decades, which had blocked the country's accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighboring country represents an initiative on its territory and has taken a lead in its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but ethnic opposers argue that the change would undermine the national identity of the Slavic majority of the population of the GDR.
President George Ivanov said he would not participate in the resolution and a miocotaz campaign has created doubts as to whether the participation will reach the required 50 percent to be valid.
The question on the vote was: "You are in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the agreement with Greece".
The sponsors of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaef, claim that it is a price worth paying to promote integration into such organisations as the EU and NATO for GDP, one of the countries that have been created since the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of GDP can live free from the European Union's embargo, because this will make our lives safer," said Olivera Gorkievska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, many Members of the House have stated that they will comply with the vote in order to become final.
A majority of two-thirds of the Parliament is required to change the name.
The State Electoral Committee stated that there were no reports of disturbances up to 1 m.
However, the participation was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, so he gave this 66 per cent of the votes cast.
"I have come to vote for my children, our position is in Europe," said 62-year-old Jose Tanevski, a voter in the first place, the Soviets.
PMM Prime Minister Zoraf Zaef, Zorika's husband and son Dusko voted in the resolution on the change in the name of the country that would open the road to the country's entry into NATO and the European Union to Stromika City of PCD on 30 September 2018.
Along with Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardkov, 54 years old, prepares a small screen and places chairs in front of scenes that have been set up by those who will be able to vote on the resolution.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join the head high, not as partners of the second category," Kavartarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we are worthy.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become a member of the Socialist Union."
Prime Minister Zaef said that NATO's entry will result in multi-stakeholder investments in GDP, which has a rate of unemployment of over 20 percent.
"I believe the corrupt majority will be good, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaef said after he voted.
He said that a positive outcome would be "the confirmation of our future".
According to a statement published last Monday by the Institute for Political Research of the MFI, the resolution would involve a percentage of 30 to 43 per cent of the votes cast, i.e. less than the required participation.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV, 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said he would vote in favour.
In order to succeed in the resolution, the participation must reach 50 per cent of the vote.
If the resolution fails, this will be the first serious blow to the politics of the friendly government, from its failure to power last May.
Next: Manchester City's Serhio Aguro passes across Briton's entire defense to make it cool
Serhio Augusto and Rahim Sterling were the defense of Briton winning the 2-0 battle for Manchester City on Saturday at Ethan Stettime in Manchester, England.
Aguro showed it's easy to cut in 65 minutes.
Argentinian attacker got to the middle of the ground at the beginning of the phase.
He passed three Briton's soldiers before he went to the open place.
Later, Aguro was found surrounded by four green players.
He crossed the border with a soldier, fleeing after a number of others outside the great area of Briton.
Then he took me to his left, looking for Sterling.
English forgourd made his first move to the area by returning the ball back to August, which used his right foot to win the bridge of Briton Matthew Ryan, cutting the right side of the right.
"Aurora faces some problems on her feet," City's editor, Pep Guardiola, told reporters.
"We said to play 55 with 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We're lucky to have a golf course at that time."
However, it was Sterling who gave the French the original advantage in the fight against Prime Minister Lig.
This ice cream came in 29 minutes.
Aurora got the ball deep in Briton's area at this stage.
He sent a beautiful old man along the other side to Liroy Sanye.
Sane kept the ball in his possession and led Sterling to the back of the shower.
The glass oven shuts the ball in the net a little before it goes out.
City faces Hoffenheim in the Chabion Lig Group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rain-Nekar Arena field in Sydney, Germany.
Serger wants to win the Rockies.
As the Nisionals were excluded from the playoffs, there was no reason to try to make another start.
But the all-competitive Serger hopes to play the Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if they continue to have effects for the Rockies on the top, as before in a game of Los Angeles Dozers in Nasional Lig West.
The Rokis have gone through the playoffs with their victory 5-2 against the Nasionals on Friday night, but they still want to lock the first place in their category.
"Although we don't have anything to win, at least we can play by knowing that the atmosphere here at dinner with the wolves and the other group will be a possible game of the highest level I'm going to face this year.
Why don't I want to compete in such a fight?"
The Napoleons have not yet announced who will be the original rapist on Sunday, but it is thought that they intend to let Serger take off the ball.
Serger, who's going to start his 34th, has made preparations on Friday and will play Sunday, which is usually a day of rest for him.

Trab makes a speech in West Virginia
The President referred directly to the situation concerning his elected candidate for the Supreme Court, Brit Kavano, in his speech on the importance of the participation of the Republicans in the internal elections.
"All we've done is bet on November.
We have five weeks of one of the most important electoral procedures in our life.
This is a very important moment, but I am not a candidate, but in fact it's like I am and, for that reason, I travel all over to support excellent candidates," he said.
Trab continued: "You see this athlete, a Russian group of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they're determined to take the power back by using any necessary means.
They don't care who hurt, who have to force them to take power and control, because what they want is power and control and we're not going to give them."
The Democrats, he said, have taken up the mission of "resistance and ban".
"And you see this in the last four days," he said, referring to the Democrats as "heavy and bad, idiots and liars."
He referred to the Committee of Justice of Georgia, giving names to the author of the Danish Republican Afghanistan, a report that was accepted with possible public experience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you find the document?
Oh, oh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting for an answer. This was a really bad use of the body's tongue, the worst use of the body's tongue I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad extension.
It is not offensive to those who express their opinion
It didn't surprise me that Momentum's activists in my local group voted to make me a fool.
In addition, I am the last of a number of Members of the Working Party who have said they are not acceptable, just because we say what we think.
My honourable Member, John Ryan, had a similar reaction because he was firmly opposed to the opposition.
In my case, the motion for a bribe was made critical because I argued with Jeremy Corbin.
For the sake of a responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, for the same questions as Jeremy had argued with previous leaders.
The call for the meeting of the workers of the South-West in Paris stated that "we want our meetings to be productive with everyone's participation".
In most of the eight years that I am a local member of the Working Group, the meetings of the General Committee on Friday night were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more flexible, more sympathetic" policy has been forgotten here and time, if it has never really started.
It is most often apparent that the different views are not presented in the Working Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether the party's leadership is accepted.
This began a little after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues whom I had previously thought we had similar political views began to wait for me to turn 180 pieces and adopt views that I would never agree with, either on national security or on the EU's single market.
Every time I spoke publicly, regardless of what I actually said, I heard a social survey, where some asked for my rejection, explained the centre's policy and told me that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And that didn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know that I am happier than other colleagues, since the comments addressed to me were usually political.
I remember the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a host of sexual or racist attacks every day, but they never tolerate it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period in politics is how abuses are viewed as more normal.
Jeremy Corbin confirmed last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of openness.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad extension and that by any proposal for a model or change of the rules of choice, the limits of the party are increasing.
They've advised me many years ago not to raise my head, don't talk too much and that's how it's gonna be all right.
But I didn't get into politics to do this.
Since I joined the Working Party 32 years ago, as a student, because of the condemnation expressed by the Thatser government that has led mostly to the failure of my whole class, my aim was to provide better public services for those who need them more, either as a member of the local council or as a minister of the government.
I never covered my policy, and I did the same in the last elections.
No one in South-West could have dealt with my political views and points of disagreement with today's leadership in any way.
To those who have promoted the proposal on Christmas holiday, what I have to say is that while the country comes against a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy on it if I trust the leader of the Labour Party.
But, really, my only message is not addressed to members of the Momentum movement in South Vietnam, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Working Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of rejection or political complicity will prevent me from acting as I think it is to the best interests of all of you.

Ir - Melrous: 38 - 17: The impenetrable Ir passes over the mountain
Two late golfers may have been somewhat disturbed by the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Ir was worth fighting in this excellent psychological battle today of the Zent's campaign.
It is now at the top of the list, the only group of ten.
Finally, it was her highest defense, as well as the best exploitation of the opportunities, which had been made for farmers, and the promoter Peter Morty had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far and we're still innocent, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Cristy of Melrous said: "Thanks to Ireland, the opportunities were exploited better than we were."
Grand Anderson's throat at 14 minutes, with Fraser Climo's conversion, brought the Irish front, but a quiet card to Scotsero Rory Huggs, who was committed to the game by the U.S., allowed Melrous to perform the numerical advantage, and Jason Bagcott pointed out a yellow without conversion.
Klimo has increased Ir's performance with penalti, before cutting, just in time, a coal with a transformation, leading Ir to a 17-5 score.
But Melrouz started the second half of the year well and Patrick Anderson's ice cream, with the turn of Bagot, reduced the preview to five degrees.
There was a long wait for a serious injury caused by Rurid Nott, who was removed by a company, and after the re-initiation, Ireland also increased the difference with a coal of Stafford McDoual, with climate change.
Additional leader Blair Mackenson took the following card, and Melrouz re-examined the digital advantage with Bruce Kolvin's glass without conversion, after a long period of intense pressure.
The farmers came back, however, and when Strawan Haxinson took a card for a train in Klimo without the ball, from the penniless line, Mackenzie pointed a yellow in the back of the attack that Ir had launched.
Klima made a transformation, as she had done almost again since the reboot, after Kyle Rowe first took over David Armstrong's lock and sent Gregory Henry away for the fifth floor of the floor.
Still Game's entrepreneur starts new careers at the station
The competitor of the Still Game Ford Kiernan series is ready to turn to the entertainment sector after it has been found to be appointed as head of an approved restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis' role in the BBC's public show, which he writes and agrees with his annual partner here and in the Greek Hembfield code.
The couple announced that the previous Friday cycle would be the last of the explosion and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Gaigland.
According to the official records, he is the manager of the company Aørømorn Limited.
The actor refused to talk about the information, although the Scottish Sun source was suspected that Kiernan wants to work with the "commissioning industry" in Slovakia.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia-based hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
The ships are sailing to the fully equipped sea captain in La Paz.
In public buildings, they're wearing smooth marks.
On the basis of the seabed from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the symbol is written: "Our sea is legally owned.
It's our duty to take it back."
Throughout the region of serious Bolivia, the monument of the monument that Gilly built after an haemorrhage for the exploitation of natural resources in the 19th century continues to be alive, as is the fate of his people to travel to the Islamic Ocean for another time.
These hopes have been expressed today more than ever, here and for decades, as Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of consultation.
"Bolivia has the power, a spirit of unity and peace, and naturally expects the outcome with positive eyes," said Roberto Kalzandilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will monitor the issue of the International Court of Justice decision in large windows all over the country, hoping that the Hague Court will decide in favour of the Bolivian ruling that Hill, after decades of rough talks, should be negotiated for granting Bolivia a government exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Vice-President of Bolivia, who gives a double fight for his re-election next year, has much to win or lose from the decision of the Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favour of Bolivia and that, even if it did, they would not change much.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no authority to grant thousands of land and has made it clear that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice is to be issued only six months after the submission of the final undertakings indicates that the case was "not too complex," said Paz Zarate, a thousand specialist in international law.
And instead of promoting further Bolivia's goals, the past four years may have been allegedly forgotten.
"Today's Bolivian government has raised the issue of access to the sea," Zarate said.
Moral's attack ritual has exhausted every lasting good deal from Hillis, he supported.
Bolivia and Hilley will continue to speak for a while, but it will be extremely difficult to make discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged taxes since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Belge, representative of Bolivia in Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was urgent.
On Monday, Bolivia will get "an excellent opportunity to establish a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility to "end in conversations of 139 years with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzandilla also refused that Morales, who continues to be one of the most popular leaders in Latin America, uses the issue of exit to the sea as a political decankey.
"Bolivia will never deny its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to go through the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear weapon, if it cannot be trusted by the US
Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Young Ho, says that his state will never abandon his nuclear weapons first if he cannot trust Washington.
He spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the commitments made during a summit in Singapore to the heads of the two States.
Ray made these comments while US Foreign Minister Mike Pobbeo seems ready to relaunch the nuclear diplomacy that had reached its end, three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's leader, Kim Young One.
Ri says that the view that continued sanctions and the refusal of the US to declare the end of the Korean War will at some point force the Norths to "wine" is a night's sleep.
Washington intends to agree to issue the related declaration, if Pionging does not take the first major disarmament movements.
Both Kim and American President Donald Trab want a second summit.
But there is a broad perception of whether Pinjiang is seriously thinking of declaring a weapon that the country considers likely to be the only means to ensure its safety.
Pombeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit in Kim-Trab.
The exhibitions of Paris fashion reveal the latest trends in the superimposed tablets that will soon be available in some area near you
If you want to enlarge the collection of hats you have or completely avoid the sun, then stop searching.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented at the parserla a series of superimposed cables for the collection of their Open-Calocair 2019, which held the exhibition at the Mods Week in Paris.
Excellently expensive hats set the Instagram this summer and their designers sent their impressional works to the bakery.
The part he separated from Valentino was a supervolcanic puzzle hat decorated with a sheet of paper that completely covered the head of the models.
Among other over-exhaustible elevators were decorated with stones, a macho hat, even a retina, but these have not been designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a series of strange masks, over time for Halloween.
Many of the massive masks had broken hands and crossed more into Hannibal Lecter than in high raptic mode.
One creature brought to the new complete equipment of spraying with air and glass, while another looked like a frozen potion in a cane.
And if you want to adopt this style of fashion with the giants, you're lucky.
Stylists provide that these huge chapels could reach central commercial roads near you.
The overcrowded hats made their appearance very quickly after the "La Boba", the fish hat with the very wide plate we've seen wear so many, from Riana to Emily Ratikovski.
The popular tree that created the excellent apple hat that set up the social networking media also sent another great creature to the bakery, a sandy beach bag almost as big as the model that moves it wearing its hat.
The narrow porcelain bag of raffles, decorated with raffles and a white leather cap, was part of the collection La Riviera Open-Calocair 2019 by Jacquemus in the Week of Mode in Paris.
The media stylist, Luke Armitz, said on the FEMAIL column: "I look forward to seeing big hats and large sea bags in commercial situations the next summer, as the designer made so much sense that it would be difficult to ignore the question of overcrowded hunters."
John Edward: Language skills are necessary for citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland have a history of academic achievement, which has continued in 2018, with a number of excellent results in the examinations, which have only been enhanced beyond individual and collective achievements in sports, art, music and other Community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Council of Independent Schools of Scotland (SCIS), are fighting to provide the best possible level of service for students and their parents.
The aim of independent schools is to prepare their students for the next and highest levels of education, the professional course they will choose and their position as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a school programme of studies by order, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable education of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela had said, "If you speak to someone in a language that he understands, then what you say goes into his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, what you say is in his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot just base our English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
On the basis of the recent results of the final exams, we find that languages are at the top of the performance boards, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages reached A.
Data collected by 74 SCIS members showed that 72 per cent of students had achieved a degree of A at random, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent who studied French, and 63 per cent who studied Spanish also had a degree A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly require children and young people in the future.
Languages today, as an election lesson, are considered equally important with science, technology, technology and the educational programmes of independent schools and others.
An EU Employment and Skills Commission study in 2014 found that, with regard to the reasons for which workers were unable to cover jobs, a percentage of the 17 percent of the labour force was affected by a lack of linguistic skills.
Therefore, the need to acquire language skills becomes increasingly exciting so that young people are ready for their future professional career.
Since more future employment opportunities require language skills, these skills are necessary in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career anyone will choose, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future, because of this right that he can deserve all his life.
If someone is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, then automatically this multilingual person will have a advantage against competition.
According to a survey by YouGov in more than 4,000 adults in the EU in 2013, 75 percent of the respondents were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a debate, while French were the only language that spoke the resolution of the respondents (15 percent).
For this reason, investment in teaching languages today is important for today's children.
Knowing many languages, especially the languages of the developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the EU by defining 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
For whatever your child is interested, there will always be some languages to choose from the independent schools, which have a specialized educational staff in this field.
The independent schools of Scotland provide an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever if it keeps them in the future.
It cannot be denied today that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be extremely important for the country's future, so this fact should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered as "national communications rights".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, multiculturality and respect for the young people of Scotland.
They have to.
John Edward is head of the Council of Independent Schools of Scotland.
Lebron's gonna make his debute to the Lakes on Sundays in San Diego.
The wait of the friends who refuse to see Lebron make his first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakers came almost to her end.
Leicester Luke Walton's promoter announced that James will play Sunday in the first game before the match period against the Danver Naggets in San Diego.
However, he has not yet decided how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton at Lakes' official website.
The reporter of Lakes McTruttle wrote on Twitter that James might be playing for a few minutes.
After a few days in advance, James was asked about his plans for the program of six games that the Lakers had to give before the competitive period.
"I don't need preparations at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
The Trab concentration in West Virginia, Canali YouTube
President Donald Trab started a series of conferences starting with Wiling in West Virginia.
It is for the first of five scheduled meetings of Trab next week, which includes districts in friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
By confirming his election for the Supreme Court to be held in wait, Trab seeks to strengthen public support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans risk losing control of Congress by voting in November.
What time is Trab's concentration in West Virginia last night, and how can you watch it online?
The Trab conference in Wiling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 μm. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can monitor Trab's concentration in West Virginia online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trab is likely to be mentioned in the hearings this week for the appeal for position in the Supreme Court, Brit Cabano, which took place in a closed atmosphere due to allegations of sexual harassment, with a vote of confirmation of Russia which has been pending for up to one week while the FBI's investigation is under development.
However, the primary objective of this series of mergers is to help the Republicans who face double income in November's elections to win some power.
Thus, the end of President Trab's campaign stated that these five conferences next week aim at "mobilizing the volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans try to protect and extend the majority of the votes they have in Russia and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so critical for its agents, which the president travels to as many cities as possible, as we lead to the multi-year period of the campaign," said Reuters, a representative of the Taliban, who wanted to remain anonymous.
The scheduled evening meeting in Wesbanco Arena of Wiling could bring supporters from "The Ohio and Pennsylvania and bring the coverage of Pittsburgh's media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the month that Trab visits West Virginia, the city that won in contrast with over 40 percentage units in 2016.
Trab is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a candidate of the Republicans in West Virginia for Georgia, who is less than in the media.
"It is not a good sign for Morissey that the president should come and try to give him an incentive to the arts," said Simon Hender, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. Group has the tendency to compete with living hopes as it leads to the Sun's singles
After three single games, Saturday's squares might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The next end of the race is a fully understood sport idea, but players believe it deeply, and especially in such an environments.
Where would they say there's the right now?
"There were six degrees ahead and now it's four, so maybe we have a little bit," Jordan Speth said as he left for the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of moving forward four degrees and remaining twelve still in the game.
The Americans, as Speth says, feel the "air on their shoulders" and have a lot to encourage them, like the giant Speth and Justin Thomas who played with each other all day and each lost three degrees of four.
Speth was a killer from the tea on the green and gives the example.
The voices of the raping became more powerful as he continued his round, bringing a critical hit to get the game four all-square when he and Thomas were down two after two.
The pressure with which they won the game at the 15th was accompanied by appropriate taboos showing his conviction that the American team is not outside.
"You have to look deep inside yourself and worry about your own game," said Speth.
It's what every player has left.
18 pieces to write a story.
The only players with more degrees than Speth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitgard, the incredible story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but valuable contribution of Europe has been achieved four to four and it seems to do nothing wrong.
"Molligound" was the only thing that didn't hit bogey on Saturday evening, but also escaped bogey on Saturday morning, Friday evening and back nine on Friday morning.
This game, as well as the way the energy seems to go to and from the horror movies, guarantees the fact that they are players who should win the Sunday and that there is no more popular player than the Flygund or Molinary to express a possible European victory while the sun is above Le Golf National.
In preference and both at the same time in different types.
The debate on European customs is still ahead.
Baba Watson and Web Sippson put the glasses in Sertzio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourball, when he played with Alex Norden.
With a bogey and two doubles at the front nine they had Spain and Sweden so deep in a hole that they couldn't get out of it.
The Lord, however, there will be no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so exciting to watch them closely because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and how a strategy can change at once.
Europe has played better as a team up to now and has a significant lead in the last day, but this game foursome has also shown that the U.S. team has the killers, despite some doubts.
Europe takes the floor 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after her fourballs and Saturday's foursomes with 10-6 against the US.
The inspired poem by Tommy Flettgund and Francesco Molinary produced two wins at a contest with Tiger Hunts and was able to take the lead in Le Golf National so far to the four levels.
The European side of Thomas Bourne, who is trying to maintain the path he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American side in the morning fourball, with a series of 3-1.
The United States was more opposed to foursomes, winning two matches, but they could not cover the difference.
Jim Furic's side needs eight of the 12 single games of the Sun to keep track.
Fligt is the first new European player to win four series, along with Molinari, known as "Moligate", after a random Saturday is only the second prize winning four levels in the first four games in the history of Ryder Cup.
Having detonated Hunts and Patrick Reid at the Fourballs, they joined their forces to defeat a powerful Hunt and the American newly formed Brixon DeShabbo with another more deadly 5&4.
Wounds, who fought in the two games on Saturday, showed random flashlights, but has lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven series.
Justin Rose, who spent the mornings on fourballs, returned to Henry Stanson's partner for the foursomes with 2&1 of the Dustin Johnson and Brooks Cape, winning the first and third positions in the world ranking.
They didn't go well for Europe, despite the pleasant, sunny day of Paris.
Three times the winner Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas set the way for the Americans twice a week.
They won a difficult 2&1 victory on the John Ram and Ian Poulter of Spain at the fourballs and later returned to win the Poulter and Rory Michaels 4&3 at the foursomes while they had lost the two pieces in the opening.
Only two times in Ryder Cup's history a group could recover while they had four degrees in the singles, although as the player, Furic is enough to succeed in maintaining the path.
However, after the second location for two days, it seems that a representation of the Lord is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it is not going to be armed alone without confidence measures.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that continuing sanctions deepen the feeling of uncertainty against the United States and that his country is not going to release its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such conditions.
RI Yong Ho said at the annual World Organisation General Meeting that North Korea had taken "a significant measure of good will" last year, e.g. the cessation of nuclear and ballistic tests, the implementation of nuclear testing facilities and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we see no corresponding answer from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way of starting our equipment alone."
While Ri has again been aware of North Korea's opposition to Washington's possible "static" approach to abortion, according to which North Korea would be persecuted as a step forward in the process, his statement was important as it did not completely exclude monopolies, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri was mentioned in Kim Young One's and Donald Trab's first summit, which took place between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim was committed to working on "the reconstruction of the Korean leadership", while Trab was committed to security assurances in North Korea.
North Korea seeks to officially end the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first "give" its nuclear weapons.
Washington was also opposed to the call for relief of the severe international sanctions imposed in North Korea.
"The United States strives to become "first decontamination" and increase pressure by threatening with sanctions to achieve their goal by exaggerating, even by opposing even the "declaration of the end of the war," said R.
"The notion that sanctions can be born to us is a dream that we don't know.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions deepen our confidence."
Rei made no reference to a planned second summit between Kim and Trab, which the U.S. leader mentioned to the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister, however, pointed out three meetings between Kim and the leader of South Korea MüJin over the past five months and added: "If the partner in the issue of abortion was South Korea and not the United States, the abortion of the Korean leadership would not have come to such an end."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from yesterday when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the goal of the U.S. country with ballistic missiles in North Korea was inevitable because the "Great President" Trab called Kim "piralman" on suicide mission.
A year in the United Nations, Trab, who recently threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, chose Kim's conviction for his courage to proceed with the disarmament measures, but said that there must be more to be done and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is abolished.
On Thursday, Trab said he didn't have a timetable for this, saying, "If they need two years, three years or five months, it's okay."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should replace Penguin for the measures it has taken.
However, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pobbeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue to be intense and inexhaustible until full, final and confirmed retirement is achieved".
The Security Council unanimously approved sanctions for North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to finance the nuclear and ballistic missile programmes in Beijing.
Pombeo met with Ri at the UN General Assembly, and then announced that he would return to Beijing next month to prepare for a second summit.
Bobeo has visited North Korea three times a year already, but his last trip was not going well.
He left Pionging on July saying that he had made progress, so that North Korea would complain to him a few hours later that he had "the requirements of a Gangster".
North Korea was committed to a meeting with Moon this month to detonate a fire plant and also a nuclear cluster if the United States took "responsive measures".
He explained that Kim Tou said that the "responsive measures" he sought were security assurances that Trab was promised in Singapore and promoted the elimination of relations with Washington.
Harvard's students follow lessons on how to enjoy enough
This year, a new lesson in Harvard University strives to all primary students to sleep more in an attempt to fight the growing mass of culture of the weekly study with the consumption of a lot of caffeine.
One academic found that students in the number 1 university in the world often do not know basic things, such as how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chisler, professor of Jatras of Harvard ’ Irish School and a qualified doctor at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the study, which he believes is his first type in the United States.
He was inspired to start the study after a talk on the effects of sleep retention on the study.
"At last, a girl came and said to me, "Why am I learning about this just now, in my last year?"
She said that nobody had ever talked to her about the meaning of sleep - something that surprised me," she said in The Telegraph.
The study, which started for the first time a year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as to improving general wellbeing.
Paul Barrera, professor of medicine at Harvard School and executive director of the university’s health services, said that the university decided to include the study when it was found that students were asleep during the week to a significant extent.
The regular course includes a series of activities.
In one unit there is a picture of a school auditorium where students click on flashy coffee, curtins, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performances are affected by the lack of sleep, as well as the importance of sleep routines.
In another unit, participants learn how long sleep can increase the risk of bleeding, headache, depression, and cancer.
A university map, with active icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behaviour of the students directly.
We believe, however, that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects when you choose to smoke," added Professor Charles.
His culture to discover because you've studied all night is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and constant pressure on students means that smoking is a problem that is becoming a problem.
The enough sleep, good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid increasing weight, as sleeping puts the brain in a sleepy state, resulting in a constant feeling of bread.
Raymond Soo, a 19-year-old califonese who studies chemistry and physics, helped Professor Chisler to design the study, following one of his classes last year, his first year in Harvard.
He said his lesson opened his eyes and inspired him to press for a lesson throughout the university.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all reform students to follow a similar programme before starting their studies in this particular competitive educational institution.
Professor Chisler advised the students to set up a notification for the time they should go to sleep, as well as a wake-up machine, and to know the harmful consequences of the "black light" emitted by electronic windows and LED lighting, which can harm the circuit system, leading to sleep problems.
Livington - Reingers 1-0: Mengka is based on the men of Gerard
The Reinzers suffered another pain outside the building, as Dolly Mengka's sweat led to Steven Jerard's detached side of the Etta with 1-0 in Livingstone.
The Imbbrox team sought to mark the first victory outside the February quarter with the season 4.1 in St. Johnston, but the Gary Holt team had just launched Gerard's second era in 18 games as a promulgator, leaving the group eight degrees behind the Harts, which is the first in the list of the Ladbrokes initiative.
Menga hit seven minutes before the middle of the day, and Reinger's obnoxious roster seemed unlikely to respond.
While Reingers is now heading to the sixth position, Livington is heading to the third, with just one angle different from the Hibernian that's ahead.
And Reingers can wait for other bullets, as Lieutenant Calum Spencer had to get first aid for injury to the head caused by an object that was thrown away from the scene.
Gerard made eight changes in the group's composition and disappointed Er in the Betfred Cup medals.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same "Libi 11" composition that took a degree from Hart last week and would be happy to see how this fine machine could blow up any resistance efforts.
Reingers may have ruled in possession, but Livington did more with the ball.
He should've cut it in the second minute when the first long walk of Menga sent Scott Pitman into Alan McGregor's area, but the middle didn't find the ball.
A deep free suit by Kigan Jacobs found President Craig Halket, but the defense officer of partner Alan Lithcow was the only thing he could do was send the ball away from the dock.
Reingers took control, but he seemed to have more hope than faith in the game in the last three years.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed he should have won a penance in 15', as he was in contact with Steven Lowells, but the defendant Steven Thompson ignored the charges of the Columbian.
Reingers had only two shots in the area in the first half, but Imbbrox's former finalist, Liam Kelly, didn't worry at all about the head of Lassana Kulibali and Ovie Ezeria's subcontinental sweat.
Although in the first 34 minutes of the battle Livi was clearly below expectations, no one can deny that he deserved the victory for the effort and only.
And Reingers failed to deal with Jacobs' problem again.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher took the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his smile and found Mengka who just made the effort.
Gerard made changes in the mid-term by getting out of Culibali and by basing Ryan Kent. The change was almost immediate, as the train dropped the ball into Morelos, but the printing Kelly ran off his line to block it.
However, Livington continued to throw his favorites into the style of the game he knows and enjoys, with the Lithuanians and the Halquets away from one long time after the other.
Holt's side could have increased the difference to the end, but McGregor was facing Jacobs himself, standing before Lithcow's attempt at the corner.
Reiner's complement, Glen Mintton, had another stage for penance to the end, as he was confronted with Jacobs, but Tomson also ignored it.
Almanac: The Empress's Frustration
A page from Almanac Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882: as today, 136 years ago and BALE ... the day in Germany the future natural Johan Wilhelm "Hans" Gajger was born.
Ggager developed a method of detection and measurement of radiation, which led to the device that is now known as Ggager's detector.
Former scientist, explorer Ggager went to the field of pop culture, such as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with competitors of the amazing rubber scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Andre, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a caver detector, used to detect radioactive metal elements such as uranium.
When you use these sounds, listen to the reaction of the people who are caused by radiation in the metal elements."
You said, "Look, it's crazy!"
Hans Gagger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, the discovery that bears his name continues her work.
New anticarcinal vaccine teaches the invisibility to "see" the problem cells
New anticarcinal vaccine teaches the invisibility to "see" the problem cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the anesthesiologist to identify the problem cells in treatment
The method includes the export of immunosuppressants from the patient and their modification to the laboratory.
They can "see" a protein that is common to various types of cancer and continue to be re-injected
A vaccine under trial presents promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman who received treatment with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize the problem cells has seen the cancer of her ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes the export of anusoids from the patient, their modification to the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein community in many cancers, called HER2, and then re-injecting cells.
Professor Jay Berzofski, from the U.S. National Institute of Carcinois in Bessetda, said: "The results show that we have a very promising vaccine in our hands."
As Professor Berzofski explained, the HER2 protein "contains the power engine for the development of several types of cancer", such as breast cancer, ovaries, respiratory and intramuscular cancer.
A similar approach to which patients are exported non-smokers and then "study" how to target cancer cells has been used to treat a type of cancer.
Kanie West was overcome by Trab, wearing a hat with the MAGA syndrome, after he showed up at SNL.
She didn't go very well.
Kanie West was admitted to the studio during a Saturday Night Live after an alternative meeting in which U.S. President Donald Trab was hosted and announced that he would be candidate for the 2020 elections.
After he also presented his third song for the night, entitled Ghost Town, where he wore a baseball hat with the Sloan Make America Great Again, he gave a reception license against the Democrats and renewed his support in Trab.
"Many times I'm talking to someone white and he says, "How do you like Trab? He's racist."
If I was worried about racism, I'd have been out of America for a long time," he said.
The SNL opened with a petition in which Matt Damon, with Hollingund's sister, announced the position of Brit Cabano before the Russian judicial committee on the complaints of Christine Blazi Ford for sexual abuse.
Although not translated, the video with West's obscenity came into the media of social networking by Communist Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to break West with this replacement.
West also argued in public that he had not been treated well at meals because of his hat.
"They made me buliming in the kitchen.
They said, "Don't go out with the hat."
They made me buling!
And they say I don't know what's happening to me," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "I don't know what's going on?
Try love."
His comments were tested at least twice by the public and SNL's factors seemed to be in a difficult position, said Variety, with a person saying in the newspaper: "The whole studio had a nervous breakdown."
West was called a replacement of the last moment of the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, Rapper McMiller, had escaped a few days earlier.
West brought a lot of people when he sang I Love It dressed as Perrier's butt.
West supported Kandas Terner, head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, who pointed out: "To one of the most horrible spirits: TO THE STANDARDS OF THE STANDARDS."
However, the exhibition's presentation, Karen Hunter, revealed that West was just "his own and that's great."
"But I choose not to replace anyone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his "scientific") who I believe is distracted and promotes a ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
The same is true of us," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it's already "the one previously known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Danny's steps, also known as Paf Dandy, Pafi and P. Diddy.
rapper Snoop Doug had changed his name to Snoop Lion and of course the music's title had changed his first name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formly Know As Prince.
Category of murder experience for the attack with a sword in the Belfasto restaurant
A 45-year-old was convicted of a murder after an attack by a gunman at a man in a restaurant in eastern Belfast in Paris.
The incident happened in Balikacamor, according to the police.
The accused is expected to appear before the First Judge of Belfast on Monday.
The categories will be examined by the Gospel.
The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, criticises toxic arrhythmia
Kit Harington is known for the role of John Snow in the violent media show of HBO, the Game of Thrones.
However, 31-year-old actor criticises the stereotype of mass hero, saying that such roles in the window are passed on to young boys the message that it should be hard to win respect.
Speaking in the newspaper The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something goes wrong" and was told how to fight the problem of toxicarness in #MeToo.
O Kit, who recently married his contractor at the Game of Thrones, Rose Lesley, also 31 years old, was admitted to have a "strong view" of the matter.
"Personally, now, I believe it very much, where did we make the mistake with the arrhythmia?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow, about the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing toxic arrhythmia due to the arrhythmia promoted.
He continued: "What is planted, and what does it teach?
What does it teach on television and on the streets, making young boys feel that they should show such behavior in order to be men?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time.
Almost something's gone wrong with our new ones."
The conference also acknowledged that it is not intended to play in any prequel or sequel of the Game of Thrones, after the end of the series of summers, saying "End in the battles and horses".
From November, Kit will compete in the renewal of the True West project of Sam Separd, which leaves the story of a film producer and his brother, who is fair.
The actor recently discovered that his knowledge with Rose's husband was the best he had ever had from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in the series, so somehow my future family and my life from here on," he said.
Roosevelt, John Snow's beloved nephew, was subjected to the character of Kit, in Emmy's series.
The couple were married in June 2018 at Lesley’s family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China refers to an increase of 14% in new cases
China reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
In the country, more than 82,000 people are affected by health services.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cross-sections were reported.
In their corrupt majority, new cross-sections were transferred through sexual contact, marking a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV virus spread rapidly in some parts of China due to transfusions of contaminated blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way was almost undisputed, as had been reported by Chinese health officials at a meeting in June.
However, compared with the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a very serious issue for the LOT community of China.
Somophilia was authorised in China in 1997, but the differences in the weight of the LOT community remain common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men having sexual contact with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of these diseases are due to insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Government of China has been committed to full access to HIV medicines, in the context of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxin Waters false that Steller has broken down data from Republican geologists, condemns "hazardous lies" and "community theories"
This Saturday, U.S. representative Maxin Waters dismissed the allegations that a member of her staff had published personal information from three Republican elders on the law enforcement websites Wikipedia.
The Republican Member of Los Angeles argued that the claims were promoted by students and websites of the "other right".
"Laughter, lies and even more horrible lies," Waters reported on her Twitter statement.
The published information is included in the address and telephone numbers of the journalist Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatz of Yuta.
The information appeared on the Internet on Friday and appears to have been published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill's environment during the hearing of the Committee of Georgia on sexual harassment against the Supreme Court of Justice Bret Kavano.
The explosion took place some time after the three geologists had denounced Kavanno.
Conservative networks, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, said that the IP address identifying the source of the entries was linked to the Waters office and published the data of a member of Waters' staff, said The Hill.
"This inalienable claim is completely true and false," said Waters.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been violated because of these allegations and false claims, was not in any case responsible for spreading these information.
This inalienable claim is absolutely true and false."
Wester's statement was quickly rejected on the Internet, among others from the former White Wyom writer, Ari Flezer.
"This mess is full of anger, Fleser wrote.
"This shows that he has no intention of being a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he didn't do, he doesn't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be a hero.
He should not question the motives of the one who accuses him.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleser seemed to compare the way Waters reacted to the criticism of the Republican judge Cabano, who was accused by his critics of being very angry at the hearing of Thursday.
Omar Navaro, a candidate for the Republicans who strives to bring Water to the inter-elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"It's great if it's true," he said.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had notified "the competent authorities and the law enforcement authorities of these false claims".
"We will do everything we can to find the responsible," he continued, "and report on all their acts that are destructive and dangerous to any and all members of my staff."
Critic of the film Johnny English Žanachtipa - a subtle design film with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit's brands in every new video with British character and this seems to apply to this revision of the franchise-cod action film with hero Johnny Ingleis, which started in 2003 with Johnny English film and replayed in 2011 with Johnny English: The Prize.
Can this humorous car about how likely we are to become the new export opportunity of the nation?
In any case, uninhibited John Ingleis could renew his permission to make them a monster for a second time. His name says it's a wider comical creation designed for non-english cinematographers.
It is of course a secret actor who, while claiming to have the reception and ways of a secret agent, brings a little to Cluzo, with a dose from "Master Bin" and some of the guy who only played one and only songs on the music theme of the film The ways of Light at the beginning of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
It is also based on the traveling and international man of mystery that Atkinson once submitted to Barclaycard's most forgotten television ads, spreading the chaos at his end.
There are one or two beautiful moments in this last film of the JE.
I liked it when Johnny Ingleis approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the kids hit his chest.
Atkinson shows his talent in the code, however, the chimory is quite subtle and strange, especially at the time when "very" cinematographic franchise such as 007 and the Risk Messenger contains more than enough comic data.
The humor seems to be addressed to children and not to adults and, in my opinion, the crazy impressions of Johnny Ingglis are not as exorbitant and close as the stock of the Ackinson movie type for the Bin era.
The eternal central issue is that Great Britain has a serious problem.
A government hacker has hacked into the super secret Internet network of British maps, bringing out the identity of all British doctors who are in a mission to great disappointment to the worker in service, which Kevin Elton is under in a sad little role for his whites.
It is the last step for a volunteer prime minister who is in love for the defeat because of political resilience: Emma Tomson does what he can best with this character that reminds Teresa Mei, but the scenario is not particularly helpful.
The information consultants inform her that, as each active survey has been discovered, she should bring back someone who has been trained.
And that means Johnny Ingleis, who now works as a director at some aristocracy school, but gives remarkable lessons for mysterious workers: here are some beautiful scenes, as England offers a record of design for a High Rock School.
Ingglis returns to Witthol for urgent information and repeats with Baf's former and late partner, whom Ben Miller submits again.
Buff is now married to an underprivileged manager, a crazy role in which Vicki Pepperdin is not fully qualified.
Thus, Batman and Robin of the vessel for this Magnificent Service return to action, meeting the beautiful and shared Ophelia Bultova, under the leadership of Olga Kirilenko.
In the meantime, Prime Minister is threatened by the charismatic billionaire technology that claims to be able to solve Britain's technological gaps: the threatening Jason Volta, which Jake Lewis submits.
Ingglis and Baf begin to ride their stock market: converted as waiters, set fire to a cold French restaurant, cause chaos as they try to survive anonymously in the Bolt's multicolored garden, and the Ingglis causes anxiety as he works to use an iconic reality device to be equipped with the inner home of Volta.
All cookies are used in this last scene, but as valuable and fascinating and, if it is, it continues to remember a little child television.
Measuring things.
And as with other movies Johnny English I wonder: can't the British cinema industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where it will actually make it bigger with his talent?
Workers lie that they are considering a plan to work for the British for four days, but pay for five days
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is going to consider a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five-day work.
The party, according to information, seeks to manage the savings achieved by restoring technical understanding (AI) to employees by giving them an additional day of freedom.
Thus, workers will enjoy three days a week without reducing their share.
Sources point out that the idea coincides with the economic agents and the plans of the party in order to return sugar to the workers.
The four-week change was approved by the Conference of the Working Groups as a means of benefiting workers from the translated economy.
Another source from the Working Party stated in the newspaper The Sunday Times: "A change of policy is expected before the end of the year.
"It won't happen in one night, but the four-day week work week is a volunteer which is reflected in the approach of the Section for Economic Re-inspection for the Workers, as well as the overall strategy of the Section for Industry."
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Committee of the Regions has been promised four-day working weeks in the general pre-election of the campaign in 2017.
However, this view is not currently supported by the entire Labour Party.
A representative of the Working Party said: "The four-day working week is not the party's policy and is not examined by the party".
The writer of the government scandal, John McDonald, used the workshop last week to develop his vision of a socialist recovery in the economy.
McDonald said he was determined to regain power from "representing directors" and "sellers" to companies of common interest.
The plans of the author of government auctions also mean that today's participants in the heating companies may not take their full share back, as a potential government of the Workers could be made in "debts" due to suspected accidents.
It also confirmed the plans to place employees in the corporate management councils and to create mutual participation funds in order to give 10% of private sector companies to officials who will receive an annual share of up to 500 stars of England.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking at 60 Minutes issue about whether the FBI investigation for Cabano could change their opinion.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Bret Kavano delayed the final vote on his appeal to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the service's decisions could affect some Republican journalists to withdraw their support.
At a meeting on Sunday, Scott Pelley, responsible for the 60-minute broadcast, asked the Republican journalists John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could be upset by anything that would have made them change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
"Yes, it does," said Kennedy.
"I said that when I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Cabano.
I called him after the incident, when the complaint came out, and I asked him directly, "Did you do it?"
He was a driver, determined, responsible."
However, Graham's vote does not seem to change.
"I've decided for Brett Cabano and I'll need an explosive category to change my mind," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it's like, "Bret's denied it enthusiast," added Graham, mentioned at Christine Blazi Ford.
"And whoever's named, he can't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see it changing something new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a rich program and famous stars, but also a equally impressive mission: the eradication of world poverty.
For seven years now, tens of thousands are scheduled to turn to the Great Law of Central Park in the context of the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Kardy Bike and Son Medie, but also to satisfy the real goal of the exhibition, which is the elimination of absolute poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is the launch of the Global Poverty Project, an international pressure group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of those actively competing against it.
In order to ensure a free ticket in the exhibition (except if they were willing to buy a VIP ticket), the interested parties had to complete a series of missions or "actions", as volunteers said, to send an email to a world leader, to call or find other essential ways to contribute to their awareness of their objective of eradicating poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen while they are still 12 years old to achieve its goal?
Is it the idea of compensation with a free society the right way to convince our colleagues to take action or is it just another case of what is called "clicactivism", when some feel that they are actually making the difference by signing an electronic request or by sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen Group has reported that more than 19 million "actions" have been registered by its supporters, promoting a number of different objectives.
It states that these actions have helped world leaders to communicate commitments and policies corresponding to more than $37 billion, which will affect lives more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group made 390 commitments and notifications as a result of these actions, which have already been distributed or concentrated at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that the secured capital has so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the basic commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British association of investors and producers who have taken the commitment "to help children fully appreciate their capabilities", promised to give Rwanda $35 million to eliminate the stigma, taking over 4,700 tweets from members of the Global Citizens community.
"With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizens community like you, we can make social injustice of subsidization a sign in history," said Trisi Olman, president of The Power of Nutrition, in public during the live society in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, following the 5,000 actions and the United Kingdom's call for better food for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project entitled The Power of Nutrition, which addresses 5 million women and children with food interventions.
Answering the question "What makes you think we can eliminate absolute poverty?", which is included in the frequently asked questions on the site,
A member of the Global Citizen community replied: "The road will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like all major human rights movements and counter-hartheads before us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful than we are.
Janet Jackson, Wickent, Son Mindy, Cardy Bike, and Janel Mona are some of the artists who will appear at the party in New York City, which will be presented by the Debora-Li Farnas and Hyu Jakman.
The US can use the U.S. War Navy for "exclusion" by preventing Russia's exports of energy - Minister of the Interior
Washington may return "if necessary" to its Military Navy in order to prevent the availability of Russian energy on the markets, including the Middle East, as U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Jinke discovered, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's blockade in Syria, where it operates after an invitation from the legal government, is a proposal for the investigation of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reasons for those in the Middle East are that they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern and South Europe," he said, according to information.
According to the Minister, there are ways and means to deal with Russian activity.
"The United States has the opportunity, with the support of the War Navy, to ensure that the maritime routes will remain open and, if necessary, to exclude them, to ensure that Russian energy will not be spread on the market," he said.
Zinke was addressed to the participants in the exhibition that was hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is characterised as "the voice of the consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia's and Iran's treatment, pointing out that they are really the same.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is a little bit of the value and replacement of the fuels," said Russia with the "one-off" character, as it has an economy based on gold fuels.
Statements have been made as Trab’s administration has taken the task of strengthening the exports of American frozen natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the most cheap choice for European consumers.
For this reason, the administration of Trab, including President Donald Trabb himself, is trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "adequate" project for the North Stream 2 that, according to the Trab, would become the Berlin "smooth" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that North Stream 2 is a project with a budget of $11 billion, which is going to double the existing volume of traffic at 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
Cremlin argues that the ongoing opposition of Washington to the project is motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exertion and that consumers should be able to choose the gas supplier they want," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with the US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position led to Germany's reaction, which stressed its commitment to the implementation of the project.
Germany's top organization for industry, the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the US to withdraw from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting with Germany's Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider the possibility of a candidate for the Presidency in 2020, says the mayor of Massachusetts
The mayor of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said on Saturday that he would seriously consider the possibility of making an appeal for the Presidency after the inter-elections.
At a meeting at Hollywood headquarters in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he is considering the possibility.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington to correct our problem government, and that's why a woman in the top needs it," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will consider the possibility of an appeal for the Presidency."
Warren criticized President Donald Trab during the meeting, saying that "she leads the country to wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trab is doing in our democracy," he said.
Warren did not weigh her words on Drabb and his appeal for the Supreme Court, Brett Cabano.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "Of course it is necessary to investigate the FBI before the vote."
A statement published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's voters do not believe that they should vote for the Presidency in 2020.
58% of the "Possible" voters of Masahushet said that the grower should not make an appeal, according to a statement by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% was in favour of such an appeal.
The publication showed more support for a possible candidate than former Prime Minister Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a potential candidate and 48% in favour of the latter.
Other popular names from the Democrats who have discussed a possible candidate for 2020 are former President Joe Bainten and journalist Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Baiden said he would have decided officially by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Peelin was mentioned in the Trak Peelin Metastas Disorder at the Donald Trab conference
Trak Pellin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after his September war.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"With what my son has been through since he returned, I can understand other families who live with the effects of the Intermediate Storm and the injuries our soldiers carry when they return to their homeland," he said to the community at the conference for Donald Trab in Toulza, Oklahoma.
Peilin described his conclusion as "a bomb ready to explode" and said of her son and other veterans that "return a little different, return more severe, return the suspects if there is respect for what soldiers, aircraft and any other member of the army have done for the country".
He was arrested on Monday at Vasila, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, an intervention in reference to domestic violence and armed robbery while he was in a position to act, according to Dan Bennet, a representative of the police department of Vasila.
18 Colombia and the region support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Fifteen cities and the region of Colombia support a legal challenge of the new US policy that refuses to provide asylum to victims who are trying to escape from customs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 municipalities and the region submitted a report by amicus curiae on the Easter in Washington, supporting a requesting asylum to challenge politics, said NBC News.
The full name of the American Civil Liberties Union for Greece in Cessian treatment has not been discovered in August against the federal policy.
He stated that her associate "and his violent sons who are members of the union" had abused her, but the U.S. officials rejected her request for an abortion on 20 July.
He was kept in Texas.
Citizens who support Greece have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers in the United States come, as countries facing serious problems with customs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy rejected the 2014 Decision adopted by the Commission on Migration (BIA) and allowed asylum seekers who fled from situations of domestic violence to submit an application for asylum.
The Secretary-General of the Colombia Region, Carl Rasin, said that the new policy "has ignored all decades of political, federal and international law".
"In accordance with federal law, all applications for asylum must be examined on the basis of the special events and circumstances of the application. Such a fraud violates this principle," said a friend Curiae.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy denying access to immigrants is damaging the US economy, claiming that it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and to "make the necessary labour force".
In June, General Inspector Jeff Jessesson commissioned the judicial prosecutors to refrain from giving asylum to victims who try to escape from situations of domestic violence and punishment.
"The asylum is available to those who leave the country of origin because of their expulsion or intimidation because of their detention, religion, nationality or participation in a particular social group or political opinion," Cesion said in his communication on politics on 11 June.
The purpose of the serpent was never to solve all the problems (study and the most serious) that people face every day around the world.
Unrecognised rescue efforts in Paul, as the number of dead is doubled despite the struggle for the survival of survivors
For the survivors, the situation was constantly deteriorating.
"It's very intense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, trying to comfort her child who had been burned, at a concentration center that had stood in the ruins of the city of Paul.
"Every minute the nurses bring other bodies.
The clean water shines."
Some residents tried to return to their damaged homes and to collect their existing water, trying to increase what they could find.
Hundreds of people were also injured by hospitals, which suffered damage from the magnitude 7.5 of Richter’s climate, were unable to cover their needs.
Some injuries, such as David Harris, who was under the command of the middle and the upper hand, remained outside the State Hospital of Paul, where the first aid was given to the roof because of the continued strong transmissions.
He was deeply moved by how he felt about his violent temper to throw the room into the fifth floor of the hotel where he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I was stuck in the walls," Harris said to the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then she kept quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope you're safe."
The U.S. president accuses China of "extreme" with "propagandistic statements"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a quarterly publication in a US daily newspaper overestimating the double trade profits between the United States and China, the US president in China accused Beijing of using the American type to monitor its proposal.
U.S. President Donald Trab mentioned last Tuesday at the China Daily auction, which appeared in Des Moines Register, the newspaper with the most sales in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of seeking to interfere with the Congress's elections on 6 November, a category China rejects.
Trab's category that Pekino tried to mix up with the US elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters that it was a new phase of the air-conditioning campaign that Washington has launched to put pressure on China.
Although it is not prohibited in foreign governments to publish declarations on the promotion of their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a climate-friendly trade war and have imposed a number of different import duties.
China's tax opponents in the beginnings of the trade war had the aim of targeting exporters in such cities as Iova, who supported the Republican Party of Trab, told Chinese and American experts.
Terry Brantt, a US president in China and a former high-ranking government in Iowa, said that Beijing had hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, as Brant wrote in an opinion article in the Prime Minister Des Moines Register, "has been subjected to this kind of threat by publishing propagandistic ads to our free type."
"In an attempt to reverse this propaganda, the government of China carries out the most valuable delivery of the freedom of speech and of the free press of America, advertising on a payment of advertising in the Des Moines Register," wrote Brant.
"On the contrary, in the vicinity of Beijing, you will find at least exclusive voices and no real representation of the different views that the Chinese people may have about the problem of China's economic path, as the media are under control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has rejected the offer to publish" his article, although he did not find out who.
The Republicans reject female voters in view of the intermediate elections due to the Fiscal with Kavanno, warning analysts
As many top Republicans continue to support the appeal for the Supreme Court of Bret Kabanno despite the complaints of sexual abuse, analysts warn that there will be a response, especially from women, to the forthcoming internal elections.
The feelings on this issue are particularly intense and most Republicans have said they would like to proceed with the vote.
These things can't be recovered," said the Grand Reyer, professor of Political Sciences at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, in connection with an article published on Saturday.
Reyer suspects that the recent move by journalist Jeff Flick (R-Arison) to request an investigation from the FBI will be sufficient to attract angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they are not going to forget it tomorrow, and certainly they are not going to forget November," Karin Jean-Pierer, senior consultant and national representative of the lead group MoveOn, said Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the speakers regularly called the "Nomebrios is coming!" on the road to Georgia, as the Republicans who control the Judicial Commission gave green light on the candidateship of Cabano, in addition to Dr. Christine Blazi Ford's testimony, said Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will reach a level of record," said Stu Rodenberg, a political analyst, on the news site.
"They say it's already high, and that's true.
But it could be higher, especially in the group of female votes cast in the press and the younger votes cast, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, while opposed to the President, often do not vote."
Even before Ford’s public statement in which he described in detail his complaints of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court’s appeal, the analysts had foreseen that there could be an reaction if the Republicans went ahead with the money.
"It's a huge shame for the Republican Party," Michael Steel, former president of the National Commission of the Republicans, said at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just for the vote on the committee or for the final vote or for whether Cabano is going to be taken out. It has to do with how the Republicans handled the issue and how it was received," said Guy Cecil, head of the Group of Priorities USA, who helped in the election of the Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat indebted to whom to believe after Fort and Cabano's statements, which seem to be more lighter than the second.
A new publication by YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents were sure or possibly believed in Ford's position, while 35% said that they were sure or probably believed in Cabano.
In addition, 38% said he believed that Cabano might or must have lied to his position, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Felix's move, the FBI had to investigate Ford's complaints and at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, said The Guardian.
In the past week, Ford set out right before the Russian Court of Justice that Cabano was attacked when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez argues that the applicant for the Supreme Court showed her her body's genetics while they were at a party, when they both studied at the Gail in the 1980s.
The World's Fever Plans to Start a New Network to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners Lee, the world's prime minister, started a startup with the aim of competing on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new trauma of this technology cycle is Inrupt, a company based on the open platform Solids of Berners Lee.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data will be stored, as well as who can have access to the information.
At an exclusive meeting with the Fast Company, Berners Lee pointed out that the intention behind Inrupt is the "world government".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses the Solid platform technology to allow users to create their "personal electronic storage space" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, work lists, journals, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a navigation program and all of these at the same time.
The only feature of the personal electronic data storage area is that it allows the user to decide who has access to the type of information.
The company calls this possibility "personalisation through data".
Inrupt's idea, according to the company's leading consultant, John Bruce, is the company to offer resources, processes and appropriate skills so that the Solid platform is available to all.
The company is by Berners Lee, Bruce, a safety platform purchased by IBM, some conventioned programmers working on the project and a community of volunteer programming codes.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners Lee said his own group didn't talk to Facebook and Google if they were allowed to make radical changes, disrupting business models in one night.
"We don't ask them for permission."
In a press release in the Medium that circulated on Saturday, Berners Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an economic system that will protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on the basis of the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Technical Institute of Massachusetts (MIT).
In recent months, Berner Lee has had a strong voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even with Inrupt, Berners Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely happy for the next time on the Internet," added Berners Lee.
Bernard Van: A Prize Prize for the Victory of the World War A · Global Voices
The only member of the Anglican Church who has received the Victorian War during World War A as a soldier was valued in the homeland 100 years later.
The opposition leader Bernard Van received the metal on September 29, 1918, for the attack on Bellenglesi and Lehacourt.
However, he was killed by a free planner four days later and never learned that he had broken the highest British military distinction.
The Sabbath became the discoverys of a monumental plaque by his two grandsons, accompanied by an escape to the North Hamptonshire Rasden.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was an "excellent symbol" that the plaque's discoveries became about 100 years after his father's terrible act for which he got the metal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the opponent van led his order to the Canal of Saint-Kenten through a very slow mix and he received a powerful fire from war weapons and volleyballs."
Later, he crossed the line and with an "excellent man" led the line forward, before hitting himself with a three-man weapon of battle.
Controversy van was killed by a German freeman on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72 years old, said his grandfather's heroic actions were "something I know I could never reach, it's something that makes you feel extremely respected."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also set up a post-mortem chair, led by the liberal new Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said that "one of the great values he had participated in the event" and added that "the men of a known hero are shown by the support he has from many people."
The MMA's crew had a night to watch Bellator 206, but they saw Pope in Urunaki
Think about this scenario: You have enjoyed watching the favorite Bellator 206, but you are pleased to see this unique sports event.
The program in San Jose included 13 games, including six in the main card, and would live in the United Kingdom, from Channel 5, in the night zone.
At 6:00 p.m., as Gegard Mussai and Rory McDonald were preparing to leave the ring, viewers in the United Kingdom remained on wheels when the explosion changed to Pepa in Urunaki.
Some were not happy at all, as they had remained awake until the first mornings especially for the fight.
One of the people on Twitter described the childhood programme as "some kind of diseased osteoarthritis".
"In accordance with the law, this content was not suitable for 6 in the morning, so the child programme should be provided," said Dave Svarts, former president of the marketing and communications company of Bellator, when asked about the transfer.
"The Pope of Urunaki, yes."
Bellator's president, Scott Koker, said that the programme would be drawn up to include the UK's theatres in the future.
"When we think of the rifles, I think we can do them," said Koker.
"But it's six o'clock tomorrow there and we won't be able to do it until our Sunday hour, i.e. their Mondays.
But we're trying.
Believe me, when the change occurred, many messages were exchanged before and after and it wasn't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
It wasn't, it was because of the regulations.
I promise you the next time something like this will not happen.
We're going to limit it to five games rather than six, as we usually do.
It's a terrible situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt "lower" because of his sexuality
Olybinique in the divorces, Tom Daily, said that he grew up feeling lower than the others because of his sexuality, however, that moved him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until the gym that "they're not all like me."
Speaking at the first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, he said he supported the rights of gays to give the other "hope".
He also said that since he became a parent, he has been interested in less than a victory in the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Yang, a regular representative of the famous radio broadcast, has been released for several months because of the disease.
As a guest at Lavern's first release, Delli said he felt "not enough" compared to others when he grew up, because "he was not socially acceptable to like someone and boys and girls."
He said: "Even today, these feelings of inferiority and diversity have given me the strength and desire to succeed."
He wanted to prove it was "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
Olybiniki's two-time slave is a champion of the rights of the LOTCI community and has taken part in the celebration of the Community's Festivals in Australia in order to invite more countries to proceed in the self-determination of homosexuality.
He said he decided to talk, because he felt lucky that he could live openly, without any consequences, and that he wanted to give it to other "hopes".
Three times a global champion said "it was a surprise" when he fell in love with a man, American cinematographer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daily married to Oscar Dustin Lance Black, who is 20 years older than he, but argued that the age difference was never a matter.
"When you go through so much in so little age" (he first shared in the Olympic Games at the age of 14, while his father died of cancer three years later) "it's hard to find a speaker who has similar good and bad times."
The couple adopted a son in June, Robert Ray Black-Dally, and Daily said he changed "all his vision."
"If you asked me last night, I only wanted to win the gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than the gold Olympic metals.
My gold Olympic metal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from cancer at the brain.
Daily said his father did not accept the fact that he would die and one of the last things he asked was if he had issued tickets for the 2012 Olympics in London, as he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him "Dad, you won't be near us to sit in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and only when he stopped breathing and was dead I finally admitted that he wasn't innocent," he said.
The next year, Delli won the 2012 Olympics and won the gold medal.
"I knew it was what I dreamed of all my life to compete in the Olympic Games in my homeland, there was no better feeling," he said.
This was also inspired by the choice of the first song, the Proud of Heather Small, who refreshed him when he was preparing for the Olympic Games and even caused an atriol.
The Desert Island Discs is released on BBC Radio 4, every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The outside shape of Michelle will sit in the pack on Saturday at Ryder Cup.
U.S. Phil Millson will mark a director on Sunday, when he will play his 47th game at Ryder Cup, but he will have to improve his performance so as not to remember him for the wrong reasons.
Michelson, who participates for the 12th time (number of directors) in the games that are held every two years, was urged by President Jim Furrick to sit in the fourballs and fours of the Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of action, as usual for the United States, the winner five times spent the day breathing from the lines and "working" his game hoping to fix his problem points.
Without ever having the most responsible driver even at the end of his career, the 48-year-old game is not suitable for Le Golf National's close field, where distance is often difficult.
And as if the earth’s difficulties were not going to come to an end, Michelson, in the same race of Sunday, faces Francesco Molinari, a British Open champion, who collaborates with the leading Tommy Fletgund to win their four matches this week.
If the Americans, who were four degrees below the start of the 12 singles, can take the lead with a good start, the game of Michaelson can be of critical importance.
Furic expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say anything else.
"He took the role he plays today, hit me friendlyly on the back, put his hand around me and said he'd be ready for the morning," Furic said.
"He's got great self-confidence.
His name is in Hall of Fame and he has offered too much in these groups, both in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't count on him to play two games.
I thought more, but we ended up there, and we thought that we should be pregnant.
He wants to go out there like everyone else."
Michelle's gonna go through Nick Faldo's record for most major games in Ryder Cup.
He could have noticed the end of a career in Ryder Cup that didn't reach his personal record.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 tickets and seven months, although Furic said his presence had benefited the team.
"He's funny, charlatan, spiritual, he likes to make jokes and he's excellent in the group room," he explained.
"I think the younger players were also having fun with him this week. It was funny to see it.
His contribution is not only in the game."
The leader of the European team, Thomas Bourne, knows that the great adventure can soon be lost.
Thomas Bourne, the leader of the European team, knows from his experience that a great adventure that starts from the singles of the last day in Ryder Cup can easily turn into ice.
Danos made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where a group with leader Seve Balesteros managed to win five degrees against the Americans, but only when he was able to cross the final line with different states, winning 1411⁄2-1312.
"Remember for yourself that we had a great advance in Valderrama, we had a great advance in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but only after violence," said Bourne, in the picture, after following the 2018 generation to win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and to lead 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So the story will show to me and all the members of the group that this has not been over.
We're going ready tomorrow to give them everything.
We'll go out there and play right.
Nothing's done until you see the dimensions on the board.
We have a goal to win this step, and we're focusing on it.
I always say I focus on the 12 players of our group, but we know very well that there are also the same good players – the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players in a difficult field of golf, Bourne adds: "I wouldn't be too busy to predict the outcome.
Tomorrow is another castle.
Tomorrow's measuring the individual performance, and that's something different.
It's great to be in the field with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there alone, then you're testing your rights as a golf player.
This is the message you have to deliver to players, how to get the best out tomorrow.
You leave your partner behind and he has to give them everything and show him the best of himself."
In contrast to Biorn, Jim Furrick from the opposing team would ask his players to note better personal performances than those they had with their partners, except Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas, who won three degrees from the four.
Forric himself has survived the two sides of the revolutions of the last day, as he was in the winning group in Brooklyn before the unexpected era, as Europe did its miracle.
"I remember every song he said," he answered when asked how Ben Crenso, the leader in 1999, had comforted his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want a quick start like in Brooklyn, like in Medinah.
When we get this right, there's a lot of pressure in the internal conflicts.
We decide our series accordingly and we play with the series that pleases us, we will try to do our magic tomorrow."
Thomas has taken the lead in the fight and faces Rory Michael in the top game, with Paul Kessi, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fletgund and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans on the top of the series.
"I went with this group with this series because I think it covers all the way," Bourne said, justifying his options for the singles.
New delay for the new German warship
The new fleet of the German Navy should have been deployed in 2014 to replace the old warships of the wartime period, but it is not to be taken up until the next year, due to inadequate systems and the cost involved, indicate the local means.
The position in the service of the Rhineland-Pfalz fleet, of the entire Baden-Wuertemberg fleet, has been suspended by the first quarter of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which calls for a representative of the armed forces.
The ship would have had to have entered the Battle of the Sea in 2014, but the delivery problems were definitely for the success of the pilot project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships that launched the 2007 War Navy will replace Bremen's oldest fleets.
They will bring into force rules, a series of anti-aircraft fires and fires on board, as well as some steelth technologies, such as reduced radar, super-powered and audio signatures.
Other important features are that the frequency of maintenance works is reduced, as it will be possible to use new refrigerators for up to two years other than German lemons.
However, further delays mean that although the military ships are considered to be the last technology, which will allow Germany to demonstrate its external power until they are finally placed in service, Die Zeit says.
The F125 damaged fleet became a prime target last year when the German War Navy was officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss Navy in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the ship after delivery.
There has been no known much information about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned a number of significant "software and materials" that would put the warship in danger if they were used in a war mission.
The software problems were particularly important, since the Baden-Weerttemberg vessels have a total of about 120 ships, only half as compared to the oldest Bremen fleets.
It was also discovered that the ship has a much larger weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
The Rheinland-Pfalz fleet of 7000 tonnes is believed to have the double weight of similar ships used by the Germans during World War B.
In addition to the inadequate equipment, the cost of the entire project (including payment training) was also a matter.
It is said that it reached the threshold of EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion), while the original budget was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems confronting the new fleets are particularly important since Germany's maritime power is being undermined.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bartles, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Marine War "will have no ship for missions at all".
The officer said that the problem was solved over the course of time, because the old ships were loaded, but there were other ships to replace them.
It was claimed that none of the Baden-Weerttemberg flagees could be included in the Battle of the Sea.
The National Trust hides the secret life of the Nights
A new research carried out in a village in the Netherlands of Scotland seeks to discover how nightbirds use the place when they follow their food.
The enlargements will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique pharmaceuticals and will contribute to the planning of future environmental protection measures.
The study of National Trust scientists for Scotland will explore the habits of the common nanonoxer and micronite, as well as the coffee of the doveton and mustard in the Inverwe Gardens, in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at fire stations around the building to monitor night activities throughout the season.
The NTS staff and volunteers will also carry out active research using malicious detection.
The analysis of the sound of all recordings by experts will determine the frequency of night calls, as well as what kind of behavior they have.
Then a map of the site and a report will be created to form a detailed picture of their behaviour in a climate climate.
Rob Dwar, a natural environment protection consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are more important for the night and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the management of habitats, such as the creation of habitats and the best way to maintain forests for nighttime and other related species.
The night population in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have been significantly reduced over the past century.
They come from building work and development projects that affect the areas where they feed and destroy their habitats.
The fireplaces and lighting are also dangerous, as are the collective films for flies and some chemical operations of the building materials, as well as attacks by poisonous cats.
Nights aren't actually empty.
However, because they walk at night, their eyes are more useful than their eyes to catch their soul.
They use an advanced audio recording technique to detect signals and obstacles in their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important buildings and 76,000 square miles throughout the country, is considered very important at night.
There are ten trained experts who conduct regular studies, inspect the parties where nighttimes are observed and sometimes enjoy them.
The organisation has also created Scotland's first and only refuge for nightly nights in the village of Treve, in Dumfris and Galway, where they live eight of the ten species of Scotland.
The owner of the building, David Thompson, says the building is the ideal place for the nights.
"Here in Treve we have an excellent area for the nights," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many big trees and an ideal habitat.
There's still a lot we don't know about the nights, so the work we do here but otherwise will help us understand better what they need in order to increase their population."
It considers it important to take the first control of the existence of nights before each household maintenance work, since destruction of one and only small wood could kill up to 400 mothers and children, possibly eliminating the entire local population.
Nights are protected species and are prohibited from killing them, interrupting them or disrupting their safety, or destroying their forests.
Elizabeth Ferel, director of Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, encouraged the public to offer his help.
He said, "They're going to learn a lot about our nights and many of our species just don't know the development of their population."
Ronalto rejects complaints for rape, as his lawyers are preparing to send a German newspaper
Cristiano Ronalto described the complaints of violence against him as "fake news", saying that some "will want to be self-defence" exploiting his name.
His lawyers are going to send the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the complaints.
The attacker of National Portugal and Juvente is accused of violating an American named Catherine Magorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the complaint, she was brought to pay $375.000 to buy her secret and not to mention anything about the incident, said Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking in a live video in Instagram at 142 million times after the complaint, Ronalto, 33 years old, described the references "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-time winner of the Bulas Cross in the camera.
"They want to defend themselves and operate my name.
It's natural.
They want to be famous using my name, but this is part of my job.
I'm happy and everything's fine," added the player laughing.
Ronalto's lawyers are preparing to send Der Spiegel for the allegations he published, which have been described as "an unacceptable reference of statements affecting private life", according to Reuters.
Justice Christine Schertz said that the player would demand compensation for "a moral damage due to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of private life in recent years."
The alleged incident is that it occurred in June 2009 at a resort at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at a evening entertainment center, Ronaldo and Magiorga returned to the player's room, where he was taken to rape her in spite of the documents that were filed at the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Magorga claims that Ronaldo fell into the knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was at "99 percent" a "good guy", but he offered the other "one hundred".
The documents state that Ronaldo admits that he had sexual contact, but that he was sensitive.
Magiorga also claims that she went to the police and the hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to an outlaw solution, because she "was afraid of possible objections" and was concerned about her "public settlement".
The 34-year-old says he's trying to reverse the solution, as he continues to suffer from a metastasis due to the underlying situation.
Ronalto was willing to take a transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester Yunuyend at the time of the alleged abuse, and this summer was transferred to the Italian Yuvendes by means of an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "will forever change the loss of automobiles"
The United Kingdom "will change forever" if it loses its reputation as a world leader in the car industry after Brexit, said Minister of Enterprises Greg Clark.
He added that it was "sudden" that Toyota UK told BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its workshop in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car industry said that the impact of cross-border delays in Brexit would be possible without an agreement to cost jobs.
The workshop in Bernaston, where the Auris and Avenis models of Toyota are built, provided nearly 150,000 cars, of which 90% were issued in the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain departs from the EU at the end of March, production will cease at our workplace," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's Director-General in Bern.
And other car industries in the United Kingdom have expressed fear of leaving the EU without agreement on cross-border trade, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close Mini's workshop in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems relate to risks to the supply chain in accordance with the car industry in Brexit without agreement.
The Toyota production line is followed by just-in-time. The replacements can be reached every 37 minutes by suppliers in both the United Kingdom and the EU for cars built after order.
If the United Kingdom abandons the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be difficulties at the borders, resulting in delays and lack of equipment according to the sector.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep a deposit in her workshop in Derbyir one day, the company said, so the production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Tereza May's project on the future relationship with the EU "works specifically to address cross-border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want the best possible agreement that will allow us not only a temporary success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4.
"The information that comes not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that it is necessary to ensure the continuity of the supplies."
Toyota was not in a position to say how expensive it would be to stop production, but warned that in the long term the additional cost would reduce the competitiveness of the labour market and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Chuvallara, who works here for 24 years and is the unionist official of the Unit at the workshop, said that the members of the body are increasingly concerned: "From my experience, if these jobs are lost, they will never recover.
The representative of the government said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trab's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, reports the White House
The important meeting of Donald Trab with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rozenstein can "exist another week", as the dispute continues for the appeal at the Supreme Court, Brit Cabanno, announced the High Court.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Miller, who investigates the Russian intervention in the elections, the relations of the Trab assistants with Russia and the possible interference of justice by the President.
The possibility of Trab disposing of the supplementing General Prosecutor, putting Miller's independence at risk, feeds on Washington's cotton here and for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times said that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of having a girl to record her talks with Trab and make it possible for the president to be removed on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
However, last Monday, he went to the White House through references that he intended to leave.
On the contrary, a meeting with Trab was announced on Thursday, which was then held at the United Nations in New York.
Trab said he would "preparate" not resolve Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed in order not to agree with the hearing procedure before the Committee on Legal Affairs of Georgia, in which both Kevin and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blazi Ford.
On Friday, Trab ordered the FBI to carry out an investigation within a week on the charges against the Republic of Gabon, thus delaying the implementation of the vote by the whole of Russia.
Sarah Sanders, a representative of the Trab type, appeared on the Fox News Sunday TV show.
I asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "There has not yet been a date, perhaps this week, but perhaps another week of data from all other cases involving the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, otherwise I'd like to always inform the guy."
Some journalists have responded to this statement: Santer has been making a press release in the White House since 10 September.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why this is happening.
Sanders replied that the limited frequency of the information was not due to the "printing" of television journalists, although he said, "I will not disagree with the fact that they are shown."
He then left it to mean that there would be an increase in direct communication between Trab and type.
"The President gives more consultations than any previous President," he said, adding, without adding: "We have looked at these numbers."
Information will continue to be carried out, Sanders said, but "if the guy has the opportunity to address direct questions to the President of the United States, this is exactly better than talking to me.
We try to apply it often and you see that we often apply it in the last few weeks and will take the place of the type of information you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trab often receives questions when leaving the White Sea or participating in open meetings or type meetings with official visitors.
Individual types of meetings are rare.
This week in New York, the president must have shown why this is happening, with a counter-argumented and unambiguous appearance before the mainstream journalists.
The Minister of Health sends a letter to EU citizens working in Scotland's National Health System through fear of Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to EU citizens working in Scotland's National Health System to express their gratitude to the country and to welcome them to remain and after the United Kingdom was removed from the European Union.
Jean-Friman, a member of Scotland, sent a letter while there were fewer than six months of absence of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed to cover the cost of applications for a permanent residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Mr. Friman wrote in her letter: "During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on eviction continued and led to expected decisions on the phenomenon.
However, the Government of the United Kingdom has also intensified preparations for a possible non-compliance scenario.
I know that this period must be especially difficult for all of you.
That is why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of every official in relation to nationality.

Christian Abercroby is being subjected to urgent surgery after a head injury
The defense of the Tennessee State Tigers team Kristion Abercrobi was subjected to an urgent surgery after he suffered a head injury in the battle of Saturday, where Tennessee State Tigers received a score of 31-27 from the Vanderbilt Commodores, as reported by the newspaper Tennessee, Mike Organ.
The main trainer of Tennessee State Round Reid told reporters that the injury occurred a little earlier than a minute ago.
"He came to the pago and just dropped down there," said Reed.
The nurses and medical personnel gave Abercrobi oxygen to the package and then placed it in a container and carried it back for further evaluation.
One of Tennessee State's officers told Chris Harris from the WSMV TV station in Necessian Nasville that Abercroby was released from the surgery at the Vanderbilt Center.
Harris added that there is no "a lot of information about the type/extension of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrobi, a second-year student under a limited participation regime ("redshirt"), extends his first season to Tennessee State after his translation from Illinois.
He made five total tuclins on Saturday before he left the game, thus reaching the 18 total tuclins for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher discount on the United Kingdom’s assets market
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher discount on the United Kingdom’s assets market, while the additional financial amounts will be used to provide assistance to foreigners, in accordance with the new plans of Toris
The measure will enhance the success of the Corbin Army in attracting young voters
The increase in the final rate will be imposed on buyers who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects it to collect up to 120 million pounds per year - to provide assistance to refugees
Foreign buyers will start to pay a higher discount on the United Kingdom’s real estate market, while the additional amounts will be used to provide assistance to customers, as Tereza May reports today.
The measure will be considered as a test of the success of Jeremy Corbin's campaign to attract young voters with promise to provide more economic incentives and to target the high-level voters.
The increase in the end of the card will be imposed on natural and legal persons who are not taxed in the United Kingdom, while the additional financial amounts will strengthen the government's campaign to combat the lack of footholds.
The increase, which is imposed at the current end of the taxation, together with the higher tax rates that were introduced two years ago for the second-home market and for housing for employment, may be reached by three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance expected that the measure would amount to up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of young people in London are bought by people who are not resident in the United Kingdom, leading to price increases and making it more difficult for first-time buyers to enter the real estate market.
Many rich regions of the country - especially in the first place - have become "full-fashioned" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy is introduced just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction of the final card, so that more new people could get their first home.
He informed the large manufacturing companies that they had kept the prices of the high prices of landless land, but he urged Mr. May to cancel the ceilings in economic housing to restore Britain's "gravitational power".
Mr Corbin has proposed a series of impressive reform proposals, including controls on property and prohibition of "responsibility".
It also encourages greater powers in the councils to build new houses.
Mr. Mei said: "I told Persi that I would rely on my ministry to restore the British dream - to improve life for every new generation.
And this leads to the creation of the settlement market for assets.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and companies who have built abroad to buy houses as easily as hard workers British.
For too many people, the dream of home ownership has become much longer and the need for lack of land remains abundant."
Jack Ross: "My complete ambition is to promote the Scottish team."
Santerrat's leader, Jack Ross, says his "full ambition" is to become a producer of the Scottish national team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotszes is encouraged by the challenge of stopping the group of North-East England, which is currently in third place in the League One category, three degrees below the top.
He moved to the Light Station on Wednesday, after he had previously referred St. Miren back to Scotland's previous competitive season.
"I wanted to compete for my country as a player.
I got a call for the second national team, and that's what Ross said to the Scottish BBC at the Sports Sound radio broadcast.
"But I grew up seeing the Scottish team in Habden and then with my father as a child, and that's what always took me back.
But this opportunity will come only if I have success in providing groups."
Among the Russians in Sanderland are Dick Andvocat, David Mojies, Sam Alardis, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keen, Gus Poguet and Paolo D. Kanio.
Aloa Atletic’s former lecturer says that he did not feel guilty when he was called to address such a set of names in such a large group, having previously rejected approaches from Bernsley and Ipsuit Taun.
"At this moment the success for me will be measured on the basis of the answer to the question "Can I bring this group back to Prime Minister Lig?"
Because of the structure and facilities of this group, it belongs to the Premier Lig," he said.
"It's not easy to get her there, but I'll probably think myself successful here only if I can bring the group back there."
Ross started his career as a teacher just three years ago, having spent a period of time as an assistant trainer in Dbarton and a 15-month period at Hart's preparatory staff.
He then helped Aloa to return from the third grade and led St. Meren from the bottom of the submission to the conquest of the Initiative in the next season.
Also, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player in Clint, Hartpool, Volker, St. Meren and Hamilton Acanthemicol.
"It was probably a real road," he said encouragingly to take the position of Aloa's promoter.
"I really believed it was more appropriate for me to be a coach than a player.
It sounds strange 'cause I went well, I made a lot of money out of it and I've come up pretty high.
But playing it can be hard.
You've got to get a lot on a week's basis.
I'm still in trouble with the anxiety and pressure of the job, but my teacher's work is entirely equal.
I always wanted to prepare myself and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I felt with myself all my adult life."

The best time for beer is at 5.30mm on weekends, according to research.
The thermal fuel boosted the profits for Britain's tested dad but brought more pressure on restaurants.
The fathers and the bars noted an increase in sales by 2.7 percent in July, but the profits of restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent, as the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, from the CGA consulting company, who focused on the data, said: "The continued sunlight and the largest of England's expected participation in the World Cup was the result of July to follow a similar tradition as last month, in June, where Dad's profits increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were even higher.
The reduction by 1.8 percent in the income of the restaurants in June just left it to July.
Fathers and bars serving alcohol have gone far better, with the corresponding data from previous years gone far beyond the corresponding data from restaurants.
Fathers serving food also spent the summer days, although not as active as restaurants.
Looks like the world just wants to go out for a drink.
In all managed dads and bar, the oil sales increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while food sales decreased by three per cent."
Paul Neuman, from the RSM company's breath and hospitality analysts, said: "These results confirm the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of important social or sports events remain the biggest factors in terms of sales outside the home market.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to be difficult, but the decline in sales by 4.8 percent per cent per year will be particularly encouraging data on the continuing cost pressures.
The long summer summer could not have been seen in a worse time for operators in the station area and the time would show whether the lowest temperatures we have survived in August would give us a multi-dimensional expansion."
The overall increase in sales to fathers and restaurants, including new businesses, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the distortion of trade names.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales index for the United Kingdom’s pop, bar and restaurants collects and analyzes data of 47 active groups, with a total turnover of more than 9 million euros in England and is the established point of reference of the industry.
One out of five children maintain secret accounts in social networking, hidden by their parents
As research reveals, one out of five children - even 11 years of age - maintain secret accounts in social networking, hidden from their parents and teachers
A study of 20,000 Gymnasium students revealed an increase in the fake Instagram pages.
This vision stimulated the fear that sexual content is being abused
Twenty percent of the students said they have a "primary" account to show their parents.
One of the five children - even 11 years old - create accounts in social media, which are kept secret by adults.
A survey of 20,000 Gymnasium students revealed a significant increase in fake Insta accounts - it is a reference to the Instagram photo reporting site.
This observation stimulated the fear that sexual content is being abused.
Twenty percent of students said they keep a "primary" account to show their parents while keeping private accounts at the same time.
A mother who had successfully found her 13-year-old daughter's secret website placed a banner that allowed others to beat her ("see me").
The study conducted by the Digital Airness UK and the School Directors and Directors Board (HMC) in independent schools found that 40 percent of the students between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, while half of them admitted that they had kept secret accounts.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many refugees are under the pressure to create Internet sites where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilind Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in the Soviet Council of Staff.
Elylind Doyle was appointed as an executive adviser to the Scottish Council of Staff at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most popular actor in Scotland, and President Jan Bity has trained her election as a great opportunity for those who lead the tragedy to benefit from her wide experience at international level in the last decade.
"Eylind enjoys great respect for all the Scottish, British and world-wide society of Steve and we are sure that Sweden's stand will have a great benefit from its accession to the Council," Betty said.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the gold medal at 200 and 400 meters in the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, earned a total of four Olympic medals and is more regular at the BBC, remained on the average after a premature medical crisis.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I went to the capital.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will show me how late I'll be.
It was awesome, but I was completely tired, I learned to walk again, and today I'm taking advantage of it!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Dissemination of motherhood comparing mothers with females leads to the online common opinion
A parent company has shared the Internet opinion with a publication comparing mothers born with females.
In order to launch the so-called "worldly first railway and satellite transport", Elvie's consumer technology company has set up a chimory release inspired by a video clip to show the freedom it offers to pregnant mothers to the new tower.
Four real mothers dance in a bunch of wild animals full of song, with a song that includes poems such as, "Yes, I match myself, but you don't see any heaven" and "If you didn't notice, these are not masters, they're my asses."
The choir continues: "Take it, take it, lay it down, lay it down, lay it down, lay it down, join my ladies."
However, the publication, published on the company’s page on Facebook, has brought an online response.
With 77,000 previews and hundreds of comments, the video has produced dramatic reactions from viewers, as many say it does not take seriously the "frick" of the milk industry.
"It is a very unfortunate decision to use eggs to publish this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and born to produce milk, but their babies steal them a few days after birth," someone said.

Someone else said: "It's apparently harmful both for the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why don't we use them to publish hotels for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone added: "A publication entirely out of reality."
Others were convinced of the publication, while a woman was admitted that her song seemed "depressive".
"I think it's a very smart idea.
I'd buy such a toilet if I was still hungry.
The feeling made me feel exactly like a wolf.
The announcement is a bit of a joke, but I didn't let it go.
It's a smart product," someone wrote.
Another said: "It's a strange publication that aims at mothers who are breast-feeding (lying in their workplace or toilets) and feel like "floats".
It's not about advertising that generates or endorses the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women discovers that they were all dancing with the distinctive terraces inside their suites.
The logic behind the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who have breast milk say they feel like wolves.
Elvie, however, is completely untraceable, has no legs and no tubes and puts distinctively into a nursery, allowing women to move, hold their babies and even get out during pregnancy.
Anna Balarin, co-chair and Executive Director of Nature at Mother, said: "The Elvie Desert is such a revolutionary product that deserved a delicate and challenging launch.
By making a comparison between pregnant women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breast milk and all the challenges it has, at the same time showing the incredible feeling of freedom that will bring the new climate.
It's not the first time Elvie's tent becomes the first cell.
During the London Week of the Week, a mother of two children appeared at the parlor for the design fashion Marta Jacubovski while using the product.
Hundreds of children of immigrants were moved to the Texas border by train
The number of migrant children under detention has reached the highest levels, although the monthly border crossings remained relatively stable, in part because the strict rhetoric and policies introduced by the administration of the Trab made it more difficult to combat children with conservatives.
Traditionally, most caregivers are themselves immigrants without travel documents and are afraid to go ahead and ask some children and thus endanger their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk was introduced in June when the federal authorities announced that the superintendents and other adult members of their home would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be communicated to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Customs, announced before Congress that the service had taken ten persons who were asked to keep homeless adults.
Later, the service confirmed that 70 percent of the prisoners had a white criminal record.
"At least 80 percent of the people who are either conservative or members of the guardian's home are in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to exploit these people," said Mr. Albens.
In view of the speedy transition of children, the officials introduced new rules in accordance with which some of these children should appear before a court within one month of the start of their detention and not within 60 days, as they previously did, in accordance with refugee workers.
Many will appear through an informal conference, in the position of self-representation, in order to develop their claims for a legal provision before the court's authority on matters of transfer.
Those who believe that they do not meet the conditions for exemption will be dismissed immediately.
The more children remain in custody, the more likely they are to be arrested or treated, which may lead to violent seizures or withdrawal experiences, according to refugees and reports from the system in the last months.
The participants said that these concerns are rooted in larger facilities such as Turin, where indications that some children are having difficulty are more likely not to be exposed because of the size of the facilities.
They added that moving children to a wheelchair without having enough time to prepare their children psychologically or to discourage their friends can damage the wound they are already fighting.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish "holding forces" to be removed immediately
Speaking at the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walden Al Muelem also called on the Syrian refugees to return to their homeland, although the war in the country is still in its fortnight.
Muelem, who also serves as a complementary prime minister, said that foreign forces are found anonymously in a perpetuated area, in the preparation of the fight against terrorism and "to get a proper response."
"There must be immediate and open conditions," he said at the meeting.
Muelem continued that "the war against terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions of others have been displaced from their homes.
He said that the Damaskos would continue to "give this sacred battle until we defeat all the Syrian terrorists" and from both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily educate and inform both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the territory of the country's war.
On the question of refugees, Mualem said that the conditions were good for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "screaming fears" that forced refugees to stay away from their country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicalizing a matter that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union warned that no aid would be granted for the reconstruction of Syria if a political agreement between Ashund and the conflict to end the war was not reached.
The UN diplomats report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a de-commissioned zone in the last great prime minister of the rebels in Idlib created the opportunity to promote political discussions.
The Russian Agreement has prevented an extensive attack by Russian-supported foreign forces in the province, where three million people live.
Muelem, however, pointed out that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military operations would aim for giants, including the warriors of Al-Qaida Metopo Nusra, who "will be expelled".
The UN Special Envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to the establishment of a Transitional Constitution for Syria and to prepare the way for the elections.
Muelem laid down the conditions for the participation of each government in the Committee, saying that the Committee's work should be limited "in reviewing the articles of the current Constitution" and warned that no intervention should be taken.
Why Trab will win a second rank
With this logic, Mr Trab will win the 2020 elections again unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, the motion for a model and the scandals are first completed by his presidency.
Something that would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic film of all time!"
Until now, there are no signs of the teasing.
Since 2014, television numbers in the high-level television area have been exceeded by reaching 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled by 1.6 million in MSNBC.
The Fox News television network has an average of 2.4 million televisions in the high-television area, while it had 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen and the MSNBC release "The Rachel Maddow Show" has saved television numbers on television, with 3.5 million televisions on important nights.
It's a fire that people are attracted to because it's something we don't understand," said Nil Beer, a producer of the ABC's series of action "Designed Survivor" where a minister becomes president after an attack that destroys Capitol.
Nel Skovel, a leading comic book writer and author of the book entitled "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different theory.
It remembers a trip by train to Boston before the 2016 elections.
Her manager said he'd vote for Mr. Trab.
He asked, "Why?"
"He answered "Because he makes me laugh," said Mr. Scowell to me.
Someone can even have fun with the chaos.
Of course, contrary to what happens to television series, scenarios coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roo against Weide case if immigrant families can also restore the health of the world economy.
The change in frequency is a multiplicity that only the most privileged television users can enjoy.
But above the definition of the informed citizen when you find in six hours a special group to discuss the use of "polluteral meetings in the kitchen" by Bob Woodworth for the book "Fear" ("Fobos"), Paul Manaford's bomber jacket from a stack of $15,000 (“a full of eggs", according to Washington Post) and the consequences of the glossy descriptions made by St.
I, however, will never see Super Mario again the same way.
"What makes and gives you the feeling of the reality of you is that it gives you something every night," said Brad Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the television program "Pawn Stars" about the constantly changing actors and daily changes in Trab's performance (starting fire with N.F.L., reminiscent of Kim Young One).
You don't have the ability to lose any cause, otherwise you stay behind.
When I met Mr. Flais this week, it was a Sunday with 26 degrees Celsius outside his house on the north coast of Hawaii, but he was locked in view of MSNBC while he was driving CNN.
It could not continue, not when Brett Cabano intended to be present before the Committee of Justice of Georgia and the future of the Supreme Court was secured by a clause.
"I remember that we did those terrible explosions before, and the world said, "This will mark the beginning of the end of Western culture," said Mr. Flaiss.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right at last."

External money goes into the most limited measurement for the intermediate choices
It is not surprising that the 17 electoral region of Pennsylvania in Congress receives a flow of funds, thanks to the re-registering of the electoral regions of Congress, which has put two members of the Congress at the same position in force.
This recently redesigned pre-accession area of Pittsburgh is represented by the Democratic Representative Conor Lab, who was expelled to another region in special elections held during the opening.
Lab is a representative of another active representative, Republican Keith Rotfos, representing the former 12 electoral region of Pennsylvania, which is largely composed of the new 17 electoral region.
The maps were reopened after the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which ruled in January that the former regions were acting in opposition to the interests of the Republicans.
The electoral review in the new 17th electoral region has set up a financial competition campaign between the largest financial divisions of the parties, the Democratic Committee for the Congress (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republic of the Congo (NCRC).
Lab became a public in Pennsylvania after he won a border victory in a special electoral review that took place in March for the 18th election region of Pennsylvania in Congress, followed by many people.
This position was held by Republicans for over a decade and President Donald Trab won the region for 20 degrees.
Political analysts give a clear warning to the Republicans.
The United States considered the possibility of punishing El Salvador for its support in China, but did so back
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, causing bitter reactions from Washington.
Mr. Trab had a warm meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Barella in June 2017 and maintained a hotel in Panama until the colleagues had represented the management group of the Trab Organization.
St. Dipartement's officials decided to call the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama because of "precious decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", as Heder Newer said earlier this month, the representative of the service type.
However, the imposition of sanctions only against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received some 140 million US dollars as US aid in 2017, among others for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in economic aid and targeted restrictions on transit visas, would be offensive to the country of Central America, with high unemployment and homicide rates.
As the internal meetings were being developed, the officials of the North and Central America mentioned a high-level meeting that focused on security and economic well-being as a result of a corresponding concentration taken by the country of the past, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent the transfer of refugees to the United States.
However, in mid-September, most administrative speakers made it clear that they wanted to proceed to the meeting, giving a substantial end to the idea of imposing sanctions on El Salvador.
President Mike Pence is going to address the meeting, which has already been scheduled for mid-October, in an indication of the importance of the conference on governance, as the diplomats said.
And the three United States delegates returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal consultations under the terms of anonymity.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst located near the administration, who also spoke under the terms of anonymity.
Read History
The following pressure may be the report of Special Adviser Robert Miller on the abuse of justice by Mr Trab, for which very strong evidence has already been published.
It is reported that Mr. Miller also turned his research into possible competition between Mr. Trab's pre-election campaign in relation to the Russian attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trab will be found guilty before this body, as he prepares to re-declare the presidency in the next elections and perhaps finally before an ordinary court.
The 'yes' are many and I do not think that the fall of Mr Trab, neither of his colleagues in Europe, is inevitable.
There are choices we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will decide the course of this war.
In 1938 German officials were ready to act against Hitler, if the West had opposed him and had supported the Czechs in Monaco.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of killing that followed.
The flow of history is turned around by such points of camp, and the security path of democracy is accelerated or shaken.
The Americans are now faced with enough of these camping points.
What should we do if Mr. Trab discharges the Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds Mr. Miller's research in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since he wrote in that paper that last year the president proposed a secret hearing and that he felt unworthy of the position of the president.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the issue adopted by the Times was controversial.
"How will we respond if the F.B.I.'s investigation of Brit Cabano is not complete or fair or if it is established in the Supreme Court in addition to the basic categories of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that will put Mr. Trabb next?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter a far-fetched realm.
But because of the lesson I've learned, I think we're not going to fail.
My mother was a Czech-Slovakia Hebrew who was transferred to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had ever taken refuge in my privileged home.

Graham Dorans of Reingers is pleased with the fight against Rapid Vienna.
Reingers accepts Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, after the impressive isle in Spain with Vijarial earlier this month, will give her many possibilities for the 7th Group of Europe League.
A wound in the neck prevented the medium Graham Dorans from making his first appearance in the season until his score 2-2 with Vigieral, but he believes that Reingers can use this as an opportunity for greater success.
"It was a good time for us because Vigarial is a good team," said 31-year-old.
"We went to the game believing we could do something and we went out with a degree.
Maybe we could run away at the end, but, in general terms, Islam was a relatively legal outcome.
It was probably the best in the first half and we were the best in the second half.
Now, Thursday is another big European night.
Well of course, we can take three degrees, but it will be a difficult game because they brought good results in their last game, but, with the world in view, I'm sure we can put our powers and make a positive outcome.
The past year was certainly difficult because of my injuries and changes made to the same group, but there is a positive feeling now.
The group is good and the kids enjoy it, the supply is good.
Let's hope that we can put our strengths now, leave the next season behind us and succeed."
Women lose their sleep because of their fear of pension
Although the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they would like to be looked at, few discussed it with their family.
Almost half of the participants in the Nationalwide survey said they were discussing with their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they've talked about this to their children.
"People want to take care of their family, but they don't take the initiative to engage in the discussion," said Holly Snower, president of the National life insurance company.
Start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes very early.
Work with your council and your family to discuss where and how to get attention, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Give your financial advice: Your advice can also help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Your long-term insurance options may include a traditional long-term pension insurance, a hybrid life insurance at a market price to help you cover these costs or security with your own assets - enough to have money.
Set up your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes.
Make a comprehensive health care issue so that you can see a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that health professionals will comply with your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Also, collect as much as you can to do for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make decisions on financial matters by your side and ensure that your accounts are paid, if you are not able to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is facing an extremely serious health problem and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergic reactions?
Please refer these details to a written plan so that you will be ready.
"Not only are the economics the issue, but who are the doctors?" Martin was asked.
"Who are the drugs?

Andrea received many fires with a plane gun at Ilfracomb
A man received a lot of guns with a plane gun as he walked to his house last night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the area of Oxford Grove of Ilfracomb in the state of Devon, when he was shot in the neck, neck, and hand.
The police described the event, which took the country at 02:30 B.C.E., as a "lucky event".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries he suffered are not dangerous for his life, and the police call for witnesses.
Synonyms and tanamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a violent earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Paul on Friday, according to official sources, while the number of victims is expected to increase.
With communications to stop, humanitarian aid forces have not been able to obtain information from Dongkala, a region in the north of Palo, located close to the centre of Richter’s 7.5 degree airline.
In Palo, more than 16,000 people were expelled after the disaster.
Some important information on the island of Sulawezi are following:
Palau is the capital of the central Sulawei province, located on the edge of a narrow hill on the west coast of the island of Sulawezi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was on its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongkala is a resistance that extends over 300 miles [300 km] of actogram into the southwest of the island of Sulawezi.
The resistance, a level of administrative separation below the principle, was estimated to have a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sectors of the economy of the central Sulawei province, especially in the coastal region of Dongkala.
The development of nickel is also important in the region, but more is met in Morrowi, in the face of the Sulawei region.
Palo and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Service.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
She also hit the western Dongcala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ocean at the foot of the lake of Fire and is often affected by lakes.
Some of the most recent tsunamis and tsunamis are the following:
2004: A great earthquake in the western corner of the Indonesian province of Atsech in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226.000 people along the Pacific Coast, while over half of them were in Atsech.
2005: A series of powerful restrictions hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of May and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of dead people on the island of Nicaea, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 degree of Richter’s climate struck the southern part of Yavas, the most complex island of Indonesia, causing tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 degree of Richter’s climate with a focus near the city of Pandang, the capital of the Western Summit.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 - degree peak of Richter’s climate struck one of the Mediwi Islands, near the Sumara, causing tsunamis of 10 feet, which destroyed tens of villages and cost the lives of about 300 people.
2016: A low level of stress struck the area of Pindi Jaja in Athens, causing destruction and panic, as it brought to the world memories of the destruction experienced by the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that fell.
2018: Great earthquakes struck the island of Lompok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily displaced.
Sarah Peelin's firstborn son gathered for domestic violence
Trak Peillin, the oldest son of Alaska's former governor and candidate for the presidency of Sara Peillin, was gathered for an attack.
The 29-year-old Peelin, from Vasila of Alaska, was brought together as a witness to domestic violence, a protest against domestic violence and opposition to the principle, according to the report published on the Sabbath by the police (Alska State Troopers).
According to the police report, when a woman's acquaintance was tried to call the police to complain about the crimes she was committing, she got her phone off her hands.
Pailin is temporarily held in the Mat-Su temporary detention facility, with a guarantee of 500 dollars, as mentioned at the KTUU TV station.
He appeared before the judge on the Sabbath, where he said "surely, innocent" when asked, as the network says.
Peilin faces three categories of category A disorder, which means he can be sentenced to one year's imprisonment and a financial fine of $250,000.
It is also responsible for category A fraud, which is charged with one day's imprisonment and a fixed amount of $2,000.
It's not the first time there's a criminal charge against Peillin.
In December 2017 he was accused of an attack on his father, Todd Pellin.
His mother, Sara Pellin, called the police to accuse the attack.
The case has already been brought before the Veterans Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was subjected to categories of domestic violence, a ban on the criminal offence of domestic violence and possession of weapons, while he was in a position to do so.
His companion claimed that he had fed her in the face.
Sarah Peelin was criticized by the better groups in 2016 when she joined her son's violent behavior with a metastasic anxiety caused by his service in Iraq.
Seismo and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people lost their lives after the earthquake that struck the island of Sulawezi in Indonesia on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 degree of Richter's climate caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks have stopped, while the number of dead is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake struck near the center of Sulawezi, located in the northeastern part of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
In social networking, a video is being circulated from the time of the disaster.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a holiday on the beach in the city of Paul when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal importers demand the frequently subjected death penalty for monitoring the terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty in Saiful Saipof, the suspect for the terrorist attack in New York that cost the lives of eight people - a rare punishment that has been imposed on the community for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipof, 30 years old, has been using a rental truck of the company Home Depot to carry out an attack on a train along the West Side train in the Netherlands, by crossing legs and trailers that were found on his way on October 31st.
In order to justify the death penalty, investors should prove that Saipof killed the eight victims "by purpose" and caused serious physical injuries "by will", according to the death penalty declaration issued at the Court of the South of New York.
And these two categories cancel the death penalty, according to the script.
Weeks after the attack, a federal prosecutor brought Saifov against category 22 of categories, which included eight categories for the murder of a criminal organization, a rule often applied by the federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime and a category of violence and destruction of vehicles.
The attack called for "a significant design and advance," the investors said, describing the way Saipof had done the attack as "a cruel, harsh and impetuous."
"Saifulo Habibulavits Saifoff caused damage, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Clives, An-Lor Decant, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferutsi, Ernan Diego Mentosa and Alexander Damian Panuko," as noted in the statement of proposal.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the New York Court of the South Region has held a trial for a case that calls for the death penalty.
The defendant, Halind Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug dealers, but he was finally sentenced to the same imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was imposed on a federal case in New York was in 1953 in the julias and Ethel Rozenberg, who were executed after being sentenced to a joint execution for the Soviet Union during the summer war two years ago.
The two Rosenbergs were executed on the electric train on 19 June 1953.
Saipof, a citizen of Uzbekistan, seemed indifferent the days and months following the attack, according to legal documents.
He told the prosecutors that he felt satisfied with his action, according to the police.
Saipof told the authorities that he was inspired to end the ISIS video attack he saw on his cell phone, according to the category.
He also asked for the importance of ISIS in his hospital room, according to the police.
He said he was innocent of the 22 categories listed in the category.
David Paton, one of the federal public ministers representing Saivov, said that he was "exposurely disappointed" with the decision of the Intangible Authority.
"We believe that the decision to impose a death penalty instead of accepting the declaration of imprisonment for equal punishment with no possibility of detention would simply extend the harm caused by the events for all involved," Paton said.
The Saipof's defense team had previously asked the importers not to ask for the death penalty.
A member of the Toris says that NAITZEL FARATTZ should be the head of the negotiations for Brexit
Nigel Farage was ordered to "initiate the people's army" today during a conflict conference at the Toris conference.
The former leader of the United Kingdom Independent Party (UKIP) said politicians should "feel pressure" from the Eurosceptics, as one of Teresa May's Members said he should be the head of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Member Peter Bowen told exhibitors in Bermigham that the United Kingdom "would have already gone" so far if Mr. Faraz was the competent Minister for Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mr Mei in her efforts to agree with her deep-rooted Members was emphasized by the fact that supporters of EU Stay in Toris were involved in a separate conflict conference against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain control of the Czechs' agreement plan through attacks by Brexit's supporters, supporters of EU and EU asylum.
The opponents continued to continue their efforts to reach agreement with the Brusselsians, despite the reactions and to force the Eurosceptics and the Workers to choose between the package and the "haus".
Mr. Bowen said at the dispute conference Leave Means Leave in Solichal that he wanted to fly "the Czechs project".
He said he should have been given a title of kindness to Mr Farage and had been given responsibilities for negotiations with Brussels.
"If we were the boss, we'd have already left now," he said.
A member from Wellington added: "I will support Brexit, but we must fly the Czechs project."
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to become successors.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr. Bowen rejected the allegations that the common opinion had been amended by the 2016 vote: "The fact that the British people have changed their minds and that they want to stay is absolutely true."
The deputy of Brexit, member of the Toris Andrea Jenkins, was also present in the exhibition and told journalists: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Czechs project does not have the acceptance of the broad community, the opposition is not going to vote, does not accept our party and our activists who descend on the streets and choose us below.
Please leave the Czecher plan and start listening."
With a strong message to Mr. May, he added: "Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Faraz said at the conflict conference that politicians should be forced to "feel the pressure" if they are willing to present the decision adopted by the 2016 resolution.
"There is still an issue of confidence between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to give Brexit and we're here today to tell them "We won't let you fuck her if you do that."
In a message to the encouraging crowd, he added: "I want you to make the order of our politicians, who are willing to give Brexit, feel the pressure.
"We're moving the people's army of this country that has given us the victory with Brexit and we'll never be comforted until we become an independent, head and supreme United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the supporters of EU residence in Bermigham had attended a free conference in the city centre.
A few activists attacked the Toris against Brexit after the group's meeting this weekend.
The Member of the Working Group of the Adonis closed the Conservatives for the security issues they faced with a party's application at the beginning of the meeting.
"It is the same people who tell us that they can put in place the information systems and all the technical means needed for the E.E. Agreement. – Canada with integration, for non-target borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute natural.
It doesn't mean good Brexit added.
Warren plans to consider seriously the possibility of making an appeal for the presidency
America's President Elizabeth Warren says he will seriously consider the possibility of candidates for the presidency after the November elections.
The Boston Globe report says that the President of the Republics from Massachusetts spoke about her future plans during the conference at the Western Massachusetts headquarters on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trab, commends his election to November, contrary to the Republican representative of the town of Jeff Dil, who co-sponsored the Trab campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is considered intense that it can be remedied with Trab in 2020.
The presentation on Saturday evening was her 36th meeting with voters using the headquarters structures since the start of the Trab's appointment.
A speaker at the conference asked her if she was planning to make an appeal for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come "to go to Washington women to build our dissolved government, which means that a woman should be found in the top."
Collection for the deadly bombing of the LSU Sims
The police in Baton Rose of Los Angeles announced on Saturday that a suspect would be arrested on the death row of LSU Weind Sims in Paris.
The police department of Baton Rouss announced the arrest of Diton Sippson, 20 years old, at a press conference at 11 μm (Easter Zone).
They had published a video of the bombing on Friday, asking for help to identify the man who appeared on the video.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot dead near the University of Southern University before Friday.
"Weind Sims suffered a bullet wound in his head, which led to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to the 247sports website.
Weide invested himself in defense of his friend and was shot by Sibbson.
Sibbson was rejected and admitted that he was found at the point of possession of his gun and declared that he had shot Weind Sims.
Samson was assembled without opposition and is held in the Police Department of Eastern Baton Rouge's community.
The third-year student Sims with a height of 1,98, who grew up in Baton Rouss played in 32 games, with 10 performances as the main player in the previous season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Gran Prei of Russia: Louis Hamilton goes for a world title, as his team's instructions gave him victory on Sebastian Fettel
It became clear from the moment Valteri Botas passed before Louis Hamilton on Saturday that the commands of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the fight.
At the funeral, Botas had a good start and almost stopped Hamilton, as he was confident of his position on the first two revolutions and called on Fettel to attack his mob.
Fell went first to the pit and let Hamilton run into the sky of the tower, which should be definite.
Mercedes went to the streets a round and then left the Bethel, but Hamilton went out after a race race, which forced Ferrari's driver to leave immediately the internal cause of the risk of being in breach of the double movement in order to secure the third season.
Max Ferstapen began his last position and was seven at the end of the first round today of his 21st generation.
Then he remained first for a large part of his fight, as he held his lattices in order to finish quickly and pass before Kimmy Raquinen in fourth place.
He finally went to the pits on the 44th round, but he couldn't increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, as Raquinen came fourth.
It's a hard day because Walter was fantastic all Saturday and he was a real boss who let me go.
The team took them very well and did it one-two," Hamilton said.
The body's language was very bad.
President Donald Trab closed journalist Diane Fanstein's conference on Saturday for his conviction that he did not violate Christine Blazi Ford's letter, which condemned the appeal for the Supreme Court of Freetown for sexual assault.
Speaking at a conference in West Virginia, the president was not referring directly to the statement made by Ford before the Committee of Justice of Georgia, explaining otherwise that those in Russia have shown that people are "unprofessional and atheists and liars."
"The only thing that could happen could also be this beautiful thing that happens in Russia the last days, where you see the anger, you see people who are angry and mean and stupid and lying," he said.
"When you see ads and explosions and then they call you "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Fanstein, did you break up?
Remember her answer... you missed the document-- oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't break it."
Well, half a minute.
If we're out... no, we're not out," added the nurse with a smile.
Fainstein received Ford’s letter containing details of the categories against Cavano in July, and it was earlier released in September - but Fainstein refused to leave her office.
"I didn't exaggerate Dr. Ford's categories, I didn't break her story," said Fainstein to the committee, as reported in the newspaper Hill.
"He asked me to keep her as active as he asked me."
But her rejection did not seem particularly to say to the president, who had studied during the Saturday session: "I'll tell you something, the body's language was very bad.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst language I've ever seen."
Continuing to support the appeal for the Supreme Court, which was accused by three women for sexual harassment, the president left it to be understood that the Democratics use the categories to serve their own purposes.
"They are determined to take the power back by using any necessary means.
You see the evil, the stupidity, they don't care who hurt, who have to walk to get power and control," said the president, according to the editorial website Mediaite.
Elite Lig: Dandy Star 5-3 Belfast Jaants
Patrick Dwyer put two glasses for the jeans against Dandy.
Dandy Stars was awarded an award for her daughter in the Battle of Easter at Elit Lig from Belfast Jaans, winning the river with 5-3 on Dandy on Saturday.
Jaanths took a easy ride with two glasses with a suit from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boviger.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kauni brought the island for the farmers before Dwyer restores the Jaans advance.
Francessa Bushar was the same for Dandy, and then two golfers from Lucas Lundwald Nilsen secured the team's victory.
It was the third time in Elliet Lig in the season for Adam Kiff's men, who came with a 2-1 score winner at Dandi in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth session between the two groups, with the Jainds winning the three previous games.
David opened the track in the fourth minute at 3:35 with Kentall McFol's assistant, while David Radersford gave the truth that Bovier doubled the preview four minutes later.
In an adequate period of full action, Sullivan put the earthly group back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Markward gives the truth about the equation from Kauni at 15:16.
Davidyer secured the jeans for the first time when he got his second gorilla for the night at the end of the first period.
The group of geologists was shaken, and Bushar re-examined with a wave of demonstration power at 27:37.
Connie and Charles Korkorran joined their forces to help Nilsen give the victory to Dandi for the first time in the fight to the end of the second period, and he assured him of the victory with the fifth goal of his team in the middle of the last period.
Janets, who have already lost four of the last five matches, are playing at their site with Milton Kens in their next match on Friday.
An air traffic controller loses his life in order to freeze hundreds of aircraft crews
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is declared a hero, as he lost his life in his attempt to secure the safe landing of a aircraft that has carried hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed, and many are ignored because of a huge earthquake that hit the island of Sulawezi in Pasquei, causing tsunamis.
Heavy shipments continue to plague the area, and many have been trapped in ruins in the city of Paul.
However, although his companions were trying to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Günwan Aung refused to abandon his position at the control guard station that was moving, at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palo.
It remained in its position to ensure that the flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was then located on the landing route, could be safely landed.
Then he got out of the control room when he thought he was gone.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia's representative, Johannes Sirett, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as he put Australia's TV network ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter from the Balikpapan in Calimandan to transport him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before he came to Paul's helicopter.
"We're confused with his death," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the dead may be thousands, while the country's disaster response service indicates that access to the cities of Dongala, Siggy and Butong is limited.
"The number of corpses is believed to be rising, as many bodies are still under the soil, while many of them have not been able to reach them," said the service representative, Sutopo Pujo Nugroho.
The six - foot - long battle that took place destroyed the apostle Paul, who was about to complete a mass march on the Lord’s Evening Meal.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute a patient brings bodies.
The clean water is low.
Mini Market is all gone."
Jean Gelfant, president of the International Star in Indonesia, said to the CNN: "The Indonesian Star fights to save survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
What happened is already a tragedy, but it can be much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joe Woodonto, came to Paul on Sunday and said to the army of the country: "I ask you to work tonight to bring in any work related to the expulsion.
Are you ready?" said the CNN.
Indonesia was hit by a previous year by rapes in Lompok, which cost the lives of more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says that a man is ignored after the plane crash in Limne
The air carrier flying to a private airport in Micronesia now reports that a man is missing, while earlier he said that 47 passengers and payment crew had safely evacuated the existing aircraft.
Air Niugini in a press release stated that from Saturday evening he is not in a position to find the remains of a man who is a burden.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find a man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more information on the carrier, such as his age or nationality.
The other passengers and payees were helped by the regional boats after the flight to the water as they were trying to reach the airport of the island of Tsuk.
The authorities told Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were in the hospital on Saturday and their condition was stable.
The demands of conflict and the exact similarity of events remain unclear.
Both the U.S. Air Company and the U.S. War Navy said the plane was added to the harbor outside the approach route.
Some witnesses thought that the plane was trying to reach the destination.
American carrier Bill Janes said the plane fell very low.
"That's very good," said Janes.
Janes said that he and others were able to move forward through the water that came to them as the means to the emergency exits of the floating plane.
He said that the meetings had been beaten and they were crying and he was suffering from light injuries in his head.
The U.S. War Navy said that some ships working there near to improve a waste were also helped in the dispersion by using a wooden boat to transport people to the dock before the ship landed at about 30 feet (100 feet).
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have lost their lives in airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none of these conflicts affected Air Niugini.
A researcher describes the night's time schedule when a woman lived
H accused authority completed her arrest on Saturday at the retrial trial of a man who was accused of losing his life in 2014 by a woman from Egypt.
U.S. Ministry of Justice Analyst Paul Roullet set hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He taught the Irish how he used mobile files to track the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Telis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Roulette said he received files from several mobile phones that showed that Telis was with Cheiber on the night of her death, investigating his previous allegations, as said by the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with the Siberian cell phone the time he claimed to be with Michael Sanford's friend, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sasford set up a witness on the Sabbath and said he wasn't in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked him if Telis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said "he lied because my truck was in Nasville."
Another objection was that Telis said he met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The mobile files showed that they were only known for a week.
Roulette said that some time after the death of Chambers, Telis described the messages, calls and communications from Chambers on his phone.
"He wrote it out of his life," said Hail.
The supersede is about to begin its invasion of the sun.
The judge said that it was estimated that later that day the court would be brought to trial.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view it has of the species, filling their music with positive messages.
High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hip hop has escaped from its roots, which were political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to his tracks and make the conscious hip hop public again.
Artists such as the Fugees and the Common win a recent reconnaissance in the United Kingdom through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
And another black one?
Dana in New York tells a couple who rejected her after she received a "racist" message.
A bride from New York is being treated as a rapist after she received a message from her mother, where she was last accused of being "another black man."
The couple are denied that they are racist, like being treated with "extreme."
Linsi Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was disappointed when she realized that the new Dante Jigel Morris was black, while the last one appeared for the first day of the work in 2016.
Mr. Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mr. Morris and even twice.
As soon as she realized her ship, the former Minister, Mr. Plasco-Flaxman, dismissed Mr. Morris, saying that their next dance, which was an American, had not done any good work and was waiting for a Filipino position, according to the New York Post.
Mr. Morris was paid for her one and only day's work and then sent her home with Uber.
Now, Mr. Morris has taken an action against the couple asking for compensation for the termination and has ordered compensation of the $350 class per day for the eight-year work period as an internal dance for which he had initially been arrested, although without a contract.
"I want to show them that, look, you can't do such things," said the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's going to be a different treatment."
The couple objected to claims that they were racist, saying it was reasonable to dismiss Morris, as they feared that they could not trust her again after they approached her.
"My husband sent her something she didn't want to send.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco's husband in Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've hurt, even wrong?
Your newborn baby?
Come on now."
Comparing the treatment with "extreme," Plasco said his wife was born just two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
"Would you follow someone who is in this situation?
It's not that kind," the bank investor added.
While the legal case is in progress, the Court of Justice of the Common Opinion has tried to condemn marriage in the media of social networking, condemning them for their behaviour and logic.
The audiences of Pandington threatened that the audience would not be interested in a deaf person speaking, as it reveals a new letter.
Bud's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to get into someone who read it for the first time before his release.
It's a lot of fun when you know what we know now about the great success of Pandington."
She said that her father, who was working as a secretary in the BBC before being inspired to write the young book from a Lutheran archeologist, was pleasant for his work, adding that the 60th year of his edition was "glycpic" as her father left his life behind.
As for Pandington, which he described as "a very important member of the family", he added that her father was blind to his subsequent success.
"He was a very quiet man and was not surprised," he said.
"But since Pandington was so real in his eyes, it was almost like having a child who corrects something: you're proud of it even though it's not your own destiny in fact.
I think that's how he saw Pandington's success.
Although it was his own creation and his imagination, he always gave the impression to Pandington himself."
My daughter died and I had to tell her instead of the phone.
After the surgery, her daughter was transferred to Nikais Louis Paster 2 Hospital, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad kept calling and told me that he was very bad, that he didn't have a lot of hopes to do it," said Mr. Ednan-Laperuz.
"Sometime, Nand called me to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to congratulate her.
And I did.
I said, "So, I love you too much, honey.
I'll be near you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep her life’s heart going slowly and out of her body.
He had already died a few hours before that time, and now they've all come down.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it all happened.
I couldn't scream, cry or cry because I was disturbed by families and the world.
I had to stay calm."
Finally, Mr. Ednan-Laperuz, who has so far fled for her daughter's loss, survived the plane along with the other passengers, who forgot the test she was experiencing.
"No one knew it," he said.
"I had my head down and they ran down all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was in the plane, it made me feel compassionate about Nand.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Women who suffer the loss of their own people hold cards in their pockets to prevent suicides
Two women who lost loved ones in suicide try to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Saron Davies and Kelly Humphreys are sitting in a corner of the Welsh map with soothing messages and telephone numbers that can be called to receive support.
Mr. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I feel everyday," he said.
45-year-old Mr. Davis, who lives in Lindney, said her son was a promising boss, with a transversal smile.
"They all knew thanks to his smile.
They always said his smile lighted the room."
However, he quit his job before he died, as "he was in a very bad situation."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he had spent his life.
Mr. Davis said, "I'm just worried there's gonna be an impact."
Mr. Davis created the cards to let the world know that there are people out there you can go and talk to, even if they're your friends.
Don't stay quiet - you have to talk."
Mr. Hamfreys, who's a friend of Mr. Davis here for many years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old cousin, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt tired or depressed or something," he said.
"A few days before the Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He had caught a foot in the Christmas day - when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look at them in the eyes."
He said his death caused them a terrible wound, but they had to pass it: "He's solving the family.
It's against us.
But we all have to keep fighting."

The future of Brett Cabano is uncertain, as the FBI is starting research
"I thought that if we could actually succeed something like what she asked - a limited length and limited object research - we might be able to bring a little unity," said Mr. Felix on Saturday, adding that the committee was afraid that the committee would be resolved by a partial vote.
Why did Mr Kavano and his Republican supporters not want to do an FBI investigation?
Their osteoporosis is due entirely to time-consumption.
Intermediate elections are only five weeks, on 6 November and if, as expected, the Republicans do not go well, they will be significantly weakened with regard to their efforts to succeed in the election of the person they wish at the country's highest court.
George Walker Bose calls to the Georgians, urging them to support Mr. Kabanno, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bos and through it he met his wife, who was the personal writer of Mr. Buse.
What will be done after adding to the FBI report?
A vote will take place in Russia, which is currently 51 Republicans and 49 Republicans.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kabano can take at least 50 votes in Russia, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to take the majority and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of leftovers in North Korea falls under Kim's authority
The number of survivors from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Young One arrived in power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, reporting data from the South Korean Ministry of Integration, said 1.127 cases were reported last, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strictest border controls between North Korea and China and the highest debts of mobile persons were serious factors.
Penguin has not made public comments.
In the corrupt majority of the remnants from North Korea, the service of South Korea is finally offered.
Seoul reports that over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the borders by name since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them operate through China, which has the largest border with North Korea, which is easier to deal with compared to the heavily protected Austratic Zone between North and South Korea.
China considers illegal immigrants to be refugees and often ignores them through violence.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are typically still in war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier in the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Piongyang to discuss the negotiations on abortion, which have been delayed.
This meeting was followed by a historic meeting between President Donald Trab and Kim Young One in Singapore, where they agreed to cooperate in the elimination of the Korean army.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Rim John Il accused US sanctions of missing progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these circumstances, in no case will we leave our country alone for the first time," said Mr. Rim in his address at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Peloisie calls Brett Kavano "extreme", says he is incapable of serving at the Supreme Court.
The President of the Council of Representatives Nancy Pelozi called the appeal for Supreme Court Brit Cabano "extreme" and said that it was unfair to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelozi made these comments at a meeting on Saturday in Texas Tribune Festival in Texas.
"I couldn't but think that if a woman was treated in this way, they would call her "extreme" when Pelozi spoke about the position of Cabano before the Committee of Justice of Georgia on Friday.
Kevino, with a strong urge, rejected the charges that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blazi Ford when the two girls were both.
During his arrest, Kevino was deeply depressed, and he almost cried and we stopped his voice as he spoke about his family and school years.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats to the Committee, characterizing the categories against him as a "territory and coordinated political killing character", which was organized by liberals who have been reminded of Hillary Clinton's etiquette in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelozi stated that he believed that the position of Cabano proved that he could not serve the Supreme Court, as he had shown himself to be predicated against the Republicans.
"I think that he himself avoided himself with these statements and with the way against Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelozi responded when asked if he would try to make a complaint against Cabano if his appointment was confirmed and if the Republicans receive the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this - if he doesn't tell the truth at Congress or the FBI, then it's not only appropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for the court at which he serves at this moment," Peloi said.
Kavanaugh is a judge in the Regional Court of the Columbia Region (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals).
Peloi added that as a Republican, he was concerned about the possible decisions of the Kabano on the Affordable Care Act or on the Roo against White case as a conservative judge.
In the hearing discussions on the confirmation of his appointment, Cabano refused to answer questions whether he would refuse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not time to go to court for an alien, pre-prisoned man and wait for us to say, "It's not great?" Pelozy said.
And women must have it in their possession.
It's a reasonable breakdown, months and years of organization and it can't get it out of the inside without crying.
"We cry when we remember," said Mr. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't find it unusual, do you?"
He kept saying, "It helped me very much to a woman who was in control somewhere, who said that she cried when she was crying, but she had developed a technique according to which when she was crying and started to cry, said to the person she was talking to, "You may think I'm upset because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And that's how he just kept going.
And it seemed great to me."
Degrees shall be allowed as part of the organ in part because they are on a explained basis.
One of my deepest memories of a work I did earlier, in a office where men ruled, is once I cried out with an unquenchable throat and took me out of the hospital with a bigger woman - a cold-headed manager I was always scared of - and took me to a glass.
"Don't let them see you cry," he said to me.
"They don't know you're fired.
They think you're upset and they'll be happy because you've lost it."
Patricia Srenter, then a Democratic Ambassador from Colorado, had cooperated with Gary Hart in his campaign for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested for forming an extramarital relationship with a ship named Monkey Business (Bromodulcia) and ended the game, Mr. Srender, deeply disappointed, thought that there was no reason not to consider the idea of establishing the same candidate for the presidency.
"It wasn't such a wise decision," he told me, crying 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the choir, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone described the situation as "The Hyonate and the Seven Horses."
Since the campaign had already begun here for a long time, it was back in funding and so it was decided that it would not have entered the electoral corps if it had not collected $2 million.
The fight was lost.
He discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave it to $250.
"Do they think I have an excuse?" he asked.
In her speech that she announced that she would not start an official campaign, she was very excited with feelings - grateful to the people who supported her, disappointment with the system that made it so difficult to concentrate money and target voters rather than for representatives and anger with sexism - which was part of the team.
"You'd think I had a nervous cloning," recalls Mr. Srenter about the reactions of the guy against her.
"You'd think Klenex was my partner.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my phone?
"You lied?"
How the trade war between the United States and China can do good in Beijing
The cheerleaders of the trade war between the United States and China were exhilarating, and while the war is still much to end, a settlement between the two countries can benefit from the long term, experts say.
American President Donald Trab delivered the first warning good earlier this year, taxing basic Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest climate was developed this week by imposing new taxes on US$ 200 million (150 million) in the form of taxes on half of all products imported into the US from China.
Pekino always returns fires to a species, while recently it imposed taxes of up to five to ten percent on the value of $60 million.
China is determined to withstand American fires, and the world's second largest economy is not likely to put it down soon.
In order to make Washington subject to his demands, he would have to comply with their demands, but to publicly persuade the US would be too embarrassing for Si Jining, China's president.
However, according to experts, if Beijing can play its cards correctly, US pressures in the context of the trade war could be negative for China long-term with reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a vital political decision either in Washington or in Beijing could create conditions for economic collapse in any of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than observers have accepted in the past," said Abigail Greys, a research associate with a research center in Asia, at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims to be prepared for the sudden return of refugees and calls for assistance in the reconstruction of the affected country (and more) war.
Speaking at the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walden Al Mualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The Government continues to restore the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore regularity.
All the conditions are now met for the prompt return of refugees to the country they were required to leave because of the terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily life and livelihood.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have ended the country since 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al Mualem said that aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country is acceptable to the Syrian government.
However, he stressed that he would not receive aid under any conditions or aid from countries that supported the investigation.
Europe closes the victory in Cyprus Reinder in Paris
The European team won the Cyprus Reinter 2018, winning the US team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 in the Le Golf National field, outside Paris in France.
The U.S. Group has been hosted 6 consecutive times in European territory and has been winning the Cyprus Reinther in Europe since 1993.
Europe took the first place again, as the group of Danish leader Thomas Biorne reached the 14.5 degrees needed to defeat the United States.
The star of the U.S. team Phil Michaelton, who fought hard in the greatest time of the tournament, threw his ball into the water at par-3 16 pieces, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian player of Golf Molinari took over all his rounds and thus became 1 of the 4 players who succeeded 5-0-0 since the modern form of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Speth was hosted at 5&4 from the lowest in the European team player's category, Dano Thorn Olsen.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, succeeded 2 and 1 against Ian Potter from England, who could play the last game in Kibello Reinter.
Spain's eight-year-old Cyprus Ranger, Sergius Garcia, was the most successful European of all times in the tournament with a total of 25.5 degrees.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stay.
It was a difficult time.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we took the cell back.
It's all about the group, and I'm glad I was able to help," said Garcia, condolenced after the European victory.
He gives the dog to John Ram's co-compatriot, who won the American golf team Tiger Hunts 2&1 in a solo game on Sunday.
"I feel incredible about how I won Tiger Gunts, I grew up to admire this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
Guant was also lost in his four games in France and now has a career director at Küpello Ranger 13-21-3.
I'm not statistical about one of the biggest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles and only Jack Niclaus has passed it.
The U.S. team has been struggling to find a goal throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who played high-level golf all over the tournament.
American leader Jim Farick spoke after his group's disappointment, "I'm proud of these kids, they've taken it.
Some moments this morning we pressed enough on Europe.
We fought hard.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a big leader.
And his 12 players played very well.
We will reconvene, I will cooperate with the US PGA and the Cyprus Reinder Commission, and we will proceed ahead.
I love these 12 kids and I'm proud to be their leader.
We have to accept it.
They were better than us."
