A Republican strategy to hamper Obama's re-election
The Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
The Brennan Centre now considers this last myth a myth and claims that electoral fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die because of the fall of a ray.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In that sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
In contrast to what is happening in Canada, American states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
And in the same line, a majority of American Governments have enacted new laws that have made the process of registration or voting difficult since 2009.
This phenomenon was extended after the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
Consequently, 180 draft laws were introduced during 2011 restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, as well as an American citizenship test.
On the other hand, these laws reduce the voting periods, invalidate the right to be registered as electoral on the day of graduation and withdraw their right to vote to citizens with previous criminal acts.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required the voters to present an identity document with a photograph.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
In 2008, the United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
As a result, the Republican authorities were forced to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported draft law in 34 states to force voters to submit a photo-based identity document.
It is important to bear in mind that, contrary to what is happening in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the social security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people aged 21 million, do not have any identity document with photographs issued by a government agency.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 are missing an identity document with these characteristics.
Often, however, the acquisition of the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.
New restrictions affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people who earn less than $35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over 65 years of age, and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have a photo identity document.
And there's more.
In many states students, voters who vote most against democratic candidates cannot use the identity document with photographs issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs to vote in the Republican parties to use documents issued by such clubs.
Before 2004 no state required citizenship proof to vote.
Arizona was the first state to present this requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly seeking to limit the Spanish vote.
It seems that two of the three Spanish voters support the democratic party.
On the other hand, the Republican legislators supported certain laws in 2011 that abolished electoral registration on the same day as the ecrutinium in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a service of assistance to electors who wanted to be enrolled.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, electoral registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 have achieved that the registration rate of new voters will fall in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states that promoted the reduction of the voting period per advance.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the last were only 13 per cent of the state voters.
In the case of the Spaniards, the same would be true.
These represent more than 11 per cent of the voters, which is equivalent to 24 per cent of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, representing 76 per cent of the elected, represent only 46 per cent of the citizens voting in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters are strongly opposed to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
In this regard, democratic governance has blocked several legislative projects.
The U.S. Ministry of Fiscal intervened in order to suspend the most controversial laws.
It was possible, in part, to limit damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 States adopted the law requiring the submission of a photo-identity document.
However, it is inevitable that the new rules adopted will make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democrats claim the party's character of the laws that have been voted, as it is clear that they intend to influence the outcome of 2012 in key states.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Centre shows that the states that have adopted those laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral college to reach the presidency.
It is too ready to state with certainty whether these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this regard, measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostatic cancer detection: Is the test done or not?
In fact, the PSA test presents, on occasion, wrong results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which unnecessary medical interventions are decided.
It is more than enough to make men doubt, already reticent of themselves, whether or not the detection tests should be performed.
Whether the test is done or not?
We have asked for advice from the experts.
In the studies conducted in the United States, there was a high rate of contact between sample groups, so it was difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
On the other hand, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality among patients who had been detected and who did not.
The study, with a follow-up to 12 years, further demonstrated that there are between 30 and 40 per cent possibilities to suffer metastasis if the detection test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend testing from 50 years of age, or from 40 years if your father has had prostate cancer.
Afro-American men have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indistinguishable.
It is really necessary to ensure that the patient understands the risk level of his cancer. It must be offered all possible options and not necessarily treated prostate cancers that do not address long-term life, in which case it must be chosen better by active monitoring of the disease.
Today many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, since that cancer is not aggressive or endangers their life.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if this progress is made, we offer them treatment.
We have more often determined the criteria necessary to determine who should be treated.
I recommend that the test be carried out in any case.
But it is important to talk to your doctor to determine whether the test should be performed.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Association of Urology, a tool to evaluate the pros and contrasts of the PSA test.

Prevention of Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous prescription to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risks of suffering from disease.
We believe that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30 per cent of cancer could be prevented.
"If no one smokes, that rate would be at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, a Canadian Society spokesman against cancer.
Instead, we assessed that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Society against Cancer, the fight against smoking continues to be a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
The tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It also constitutes a risk factor for other types of cancer.
It greatly harms people's health.
"Today for today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
One hopefully: 10 years after you quit smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced to half.
The weight
Fatigue and obesity also favour the occurrence of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and right, esophagus, pancreas and aneurys.
"Research shows that regular exercise of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they add.
The feeding
The Agency also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they scale the risks of having a colorectal cancer.
Charcoal products should also be avoided.
Conservation of the meat for your ahumid, dry or salt may cause the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage the body's cells and lead to cancer development," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamins and cancer.
However, its investigations are currently not final.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not been clearly determined either.
On the other hand, Mr. Beaulieu stressed the importance of discussing the concerns and past family history of each one with his doctor.
"Doing the detection test doesn't cause cancer."
The Higgs mailbox in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson generated a great excitement last summer, and rightly.
In fact, it is believed that this boss is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is about the particle whose existence is foretold by the standard model: our better or "bader" explanation of the nature and behavior of the matter, which has not yet been observed imperially.
But for the physicists it's not quite clear that it's Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it looks very much like Higgs' boss who preaches by the standard model.
Moreover, new data revealed this week at an important physical convention held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data is missing to be completely safe.
In any case, we assume it's Higgs, because the possibilities of making mistakes seem small.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and inexhaustible law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to break that rule and do not try too much, because it will end with harm.
Although the physics of particles is a very complex world, it has proved that there is also a law of these characteristics: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantic state"; a "state" which consists of a large way of some of its characteristics.
Physicals classify particles in two categories.
On the one hand, we find ourselves with the good citizens called Fermiones, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
And on the other hand, they are the bonsons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found in the same place at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories that, of course, is extraordinary, the bosones are divided into two groups: the moons, which we will not talk about here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature are spreading and by which the Higgs boson would be in some way impertinent.
These bosses, I would like to underline here, are not the exotic bugs we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronic, it is thanks to an extraordinary balal: the photo or the "light particle" that acts as the "message" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a particle with an accelerated electric load or change direction, "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a little like when we throw a stone into a tank.
In this "disorder" is born an electromagnetic wave (of light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photo; that is, one of the "force-porters" boons.
More stable field
The same happens with the Higgs bosone, with the difference that it is from another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" for this bosoon to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To enable it, it needs to reach extremely high energy, a little as if it were of a heated state in which only one green rock could be let down by the surface.
As a result, there is a huge acceleration of particles like the CERN (the big hemisphere is a 27 km angle of circumference!) to reach such energy levels.
Analogue with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like the Imams, do it, but others don't: a piece of paper, for example, will never be held by itself at the door of a snow.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the rest (like the photo, of course) do not have it.
Now, what can all these investigations bring?, asks Mrs. Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to distinguish between MS observations and predictions.
On the other hand, many sincerely wish to be found, since the smallest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that shuts down certain corners of the model.
This must be said, there are still huge gaps, such as it does not offer any explanation about gravity (ups!) or the dark matter, which corresponds to about 80% of the universe's matter (other ups!).
But we haven't found such differences in the CERN until now.
Effects
The effects of such research in our day are difficult to predict, but we do not think that we are mistaken in saying that there will be no one.
To see: at the beginning of the 1960s, laser pioneers in the laboratories did not completely question the revolution that their work would cause.
They interviewed scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle said, who worked in the Bell laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and that he developed the first continuous laser (the first were pressed) in 1962, the laser was generally considered a "laborator device".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also proceed from all instruments surrounding the investigation.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a light capturer in 1969 during his research on optics.
Although it was not at all its original intention, this capturer now serves as "eye" for all the digital devices of the world, which was valued by the Nobel physics in 2009.
That doesn't mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC are necessarily to transform our lives, but it's never known...
Palliative care. The best way to die... ▸ Le Dubor
In his Commission on the Death of Dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed as soon as a bill is prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to do.
Deor has tried to see him looking.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Monteregie.
The prostate cancer he was destroying had given him a breath of two years.
"They've given me five years of life, but I've already taken seven," she relates, made a pass, buried in her bed at the Victor-Gadbois Palliative Care Center in Beloeil, where she arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be ready for this," she continues.
The disease has caused him harm: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on his own.
Sitting in front of a pleasant breakfast, accept the assignment to help him eat.
Valiente, she even smiles, talks to strangers who pay attention to her, takes medications and offers her a bath.
The validity of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to be treated with diarrhoea, it's humiliating," he confides.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for that disease.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man is walking on foot," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois center.
Returning to your childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the person's ability to accept that repentance," he said.
Because, according to the majority of people working in palliative care, the great moments have a place in the heart itself of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer "curative" care.
The greatest fear of Mrs. A., 89, is to die "conscious and angry".
But the disease has made her discover to her children.
"I have good kids," he adds.
"There are no more desires for me in this life," he says, before accepting that a male is placed to help her breathe.
And wait, the next few days, for the last visit of her son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, care for the body and help with food.
They are palliative care given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help make his death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, because we all know we're gonna end up dying someday.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the center.
It is the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When you die, you are offered oral injections with brandy or Pepsi, according to demand.
Diabetes are no longer controlled by their sugar rate.
Death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday night we served him a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, her son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the center of Victor-Gadbois, the days pass without ever being equal.
On the side of a 94-year-old man who enjoys his last family meeting in the patio, well placed among his guests while all drink to his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two children, after trying hard to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under 45 years of age who have cancer," worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbosarvent centre come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem with access to palliative care
77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to relieve suffering when a patient reaches the terminal phase of his or her life, either at home, at the hospital or at a care centre.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois centre and the community of palliative care at the home of the Grand Montreal, are almost exclusively specialized in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great lack of respect for Quebec's health care, which makes many doctors specialized in palliative care fear the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by emissaries of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has circled around to demonstrate his opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone has the right to quality palliative care before it is accepted to proceed with euthanasia.
"Recently," she says, "I've seen a patient spend 14 days in Emergencys suffering great pain without having done what is needed to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients want to die only because they don't get adequate care."
And at the same time, many oncologists struggle with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognostics.
Hélène Richard's survival expectations were already low when he gave up a drug-induced chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my uncle that I wanted to stop treatment, she told me she was very sorry she wanted to stop fighting," she said.
"But she had told me that there was nothing more to do!"
There are no superpowers
Dr. Martel believes that 90 percent of the patients who ask for death are grateful to their caregivers who have not responded to their demands once they have relieved their pain through a palliative care team.
But it has to be said that palatial care is not absolutely all-powerful with regard to the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the home of Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often take advantage of the palliative session, which serves to sleep with the patient until the time of their death, either in a sporadic or permanent manner.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of suffering.
More and more, unsatisfied disease will have the possibility of having this palatial session.
The sick who are not relieved say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia", but "I want them to comfort me".
The implementation of this report has been possible through a periodic review of Canadian health research institutes.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Travel network officials, BTP entrepreneurs, policy fund collectors and experts from the Italian Mafia have, day after day, what they know of a formidable "system" of which they form part of the construction industry, staff, politicians, unionists and mafios.
A "industrial" which came out too dear to Quebec's contributors, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It's funny how the system is pumped once we've chased the big media," ironically Jacques Duchessneau, who was a member of Quebec and former chief of Montreal Police.
He led the establishment of the 2011 scandal, which was possible through a thorough investigation into road contract abuses in Quebec, which the first liberal minister, Jean Charest, had only allowed to delay.
The Duchessneau report established a direct link between industry, clandestine financing of the parties and corruption among officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport has saved thousands of dollars in contracts," including some of its attempts to stay with a proportion.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already fallen to two mayors", adds, while it is expected to be able to "demand existing strategisms behind individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also implemented with its government intervention team, investigators and analysts.
This unit also operates in the police of the "Marteau Army", which, since 2009, have made Montreal's "cartel of the Alcantarate" fashionable at the time of contract inflation.
In recent weeks, the unit has been registered in a series of accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city of the Aföröres.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his post of mayor of Laval, Quebec's third city.
It is suspected that reimbursements have been reimbursed in exchange for public contracts.
It has been formally accused of engineers from the Montreal travel network and Italian-origin entrepreneurs, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has caused confusion when explaining to the Commission the mechanism of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal for three years to an intermediary related to the Mafia that transferred the money to the Montreal Union, the party of mayor Gerald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito distributed money to register and synergy during the 2000 years, offering more than $88,000 Canadian dollars (about EUR 68,000) to provincial parties, especially liberals in power.
He also admitted that he had organized an illegal fund collection for the former liberal minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of the auction contracts
In Montreal, the "corruption system" worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a public worker, explained it perfectly before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey parties and business associates from the construction sector for a total of $736,000, all of which in exchange for auction contracts whose costs affect.
Other travel network officials have admitted that they received money to charge invoices between 30 per cent and 40 per cent for extra counterfeiting.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately having taken the heavy look at a parallel budget and filled his sheets of money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay abandoned the beginning of November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first election policies that made the alarm sound.
As a mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, he has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal land acquired by $5 million and sold by 1.6 million to promoters in full real estate boom.
70% of the money of the electoral campaigns was fresh money
From the investigation that will finally be carried out, she ensures that it takes "from a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by hormones, to stop the gangrene and fish for criminals".
And add that the process is "slow, but positive."
We are cleaning the wounds but we would need a clean research unit in Montreal and be very careful not to repeat questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regular.
Jacques Duchessneau, for his part, states that "the officials have stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is concerned primarily about the role of "political elections in the current of the strategy".
Estimating at 70% the proportion of Sucio money allocated to the funding of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironizes: "They have told me that that is no more than a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit contributions to parties to $100, but that will not change the grant, according to him, "until electoral costs are strictly limited, there will be money flow in politics".
It recommends a complete review of the public procurement and funding system of the parties: "We cannot fall below; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with more solid foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story pushes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchessneau invites those who look at the mirror.
"PSG is not the Barcelona FC!"
This period has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would you explain that progress?
It could be explained by an individual consciousness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Day-to-day advance to your side.
Technical personnel have also contributed a lot to me.
And these elements force me to daily raise the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
Everything's going very fast in the football.
But I don't like it.
From my beginnings at the InF Clarefontaine Preformation Centre to my step by Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress in action.
He will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
The recruits of this summer are accustomed to arguing at very high level parties.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti is very helpful to me about my position.
He's supported by allies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I did.
Ancelotti is the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no equal in League 1 and is among the best European trainers.
It has a great experience and has won many titles with the best clubs.
He's worked with big players.
I think other titles will be taken in Paris.
In January he had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he has in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about PSG in the first part of the season?
At League 1, Lyon has removed us from the lead position.
But we're still in the embassies.
One of our greatest goals is the League of Championships: we have classified us for the final octaves with style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
Let's try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have much to say to many and very good European teams.
We want, to begin, to finish our first link to the Opporto so that we can get the return of the final octaves.
Can PSG become a large European club in the short term?
He's got the budget...
To become a large European club, Paris has to gain titles and be there for a long time.
Today for today, that's not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is being delivered to its means to ensure that this project is concrete.
Don't win the fight on League 1, like in the last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we're going to invest all our efforts in bringing us that title of champions.
We don't get far in the last time.
In May we were disappointed, because we had excellent conditions to end first.
We had a strong period.
We're done with 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better time.
This year I think it'll be good.
Even if large teams like Marsella, Lyon and Burdeos fight for the title, I think we have weapons to carry it.
Do you think the media expect more than the PSG?
It is normal to expect a lot of us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We've totally accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, which still happens with things to blame us is a little frustrating.
We ask what people expect most.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the Barcelona FC!
We're trying to launch a game project.
A team is built in time.
In the League of Championships, we have demonstrated that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City that, after two seasons, it has not been able to classify itself for final octaves, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the invested sums, we would imagine you with 15 points of profit to the day.
That would be to ignore our opponents and France's champion.
Lyon and Marsella, who were not well in the past, have been "inspired" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is passionate.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have finished carrying the trophie.
The PSG seems completely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's success.
We better say we have a Zlatapendence.
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that he makes many calls.
He's come to prove it's the star of League 1.
And he has proved in all the teams that have passed that he is a great player, a global star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men he has around him.
What you've done is really exceptional.
That motivates others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, also allows us all to make progress.
How have you lived the Eurocopa 2012 with the French team?
It's been a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Eurocopa.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating game time.
I saw things over there and I got strengthened.
Today I can play good games in the selection.
That's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the blues.
We learned the lesson from what happened in Ukraine, and we must have exemplary behavior today.
What vision do you have from the first month of Didier Deschamps in front of the blues?
Getting results.
They are well located in the World Classification Group.
The selector is rigid, close to the players and inspired to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal to classify us for the Eurocopa.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will take the election to Brazil.
Did the empate (1-1) of October 16 in Spain serve as a base?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone's got a fight for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had never had a game like this all my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
This is contrary to current monetary exchanges based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technologies, political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is currently a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the form of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files equal to the same.
Some 200,000 transactions have been recorded using 15,000 network computers.
And almost a thousand websites accept Bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The rate of the bitcoin, after reaching the top of $30 (€23) in June 2011, fell to $25 months later, before returning to around $10 (the rates are calculated on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It is not surprising if we compare it with the world's changes in real currency or in financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, the bitcoin was described as "the virtual currency with greater success", "which competes with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with virtual currency types such as "credits", used to advance in a video game that can be won by playing or can be purchased (and even on changing occasions).
The Facebook social network has also developed this type of system.
But in any exchange, a central authority controls and deals with changes.
With the bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously depositors of accounting books, verifiers, currency stations and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses.
A user can choose a different direction for each payment, thus guaranteeing the anonymous.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that Bitcoins changes are contained in the public account book, which is distributed across the network.
The key point is to write that new transaction in that book.
This is due to the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a kind of temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding that supplementary line.
This is a phase of file split, i.e., of transforming a large file into a shorter and unique numerical loop.
Computers "cogen" the new transaction and add a number before "drop" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular needle (most important at first).
Once that number is found, the other nodes can easily verify that it is good.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of other transactions; any change would change the hole.
If, in order to make a fraud, a user would like to pay twice the same very fast money (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would be orphan, since both have different oils.
The computer that resolves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this reward is divided into two regularly, likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is, therefore, limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred million, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in the power of calculation.
The life of the network already has its heights.
The websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in storage.
"The error used does not affect the same protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real money-payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But the money actually presents the same defect.
Weight actors such as Wikipedia reject payments of this type.
Others, such as the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounting and showed that about 80% of bitcoins are not around.
In November, the giant giants were released.
"The $30,000 has changed," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who turns the bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on this coin, believes enough in the potential of this technology in addition to the transaction network.
Your system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a mobile payment without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which will make it cheaper.
The carrier also manages its identity and can therefore remain in the anonymous.
The system is easy to start in trade, which do not need to install new terminals or software.
It's enough to provide them with a direction that a phone can "photo and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who ensures thousands of users.
There is a general motion for revision of the hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
"There will be a time for Bitcoin to be imposed, but in 2013 there could be a change," he predicts.
On the other hand, in its report, the ECB intends to reassess the various risks, which are considered high today, if this money is successful.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kaspisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans must leave by the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army withdraws possession of its territory and that the Afghans choose their future, without expecting any of us.
We have punished especially the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And for ourselves, with our 88 murdered soldiers, more wounded and mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugees in Pakistan, but often also with peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in the Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if for their reasons the Yihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks or Thais are united.
Tolerated, sometimes even assisted by local insurers, these will no longer be the case when the Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which has been observed from the height of the hills planted with almendra thanks to the French credits, has been ordered.
The trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without any attack by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban afluence in Kabul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistibility between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country around the fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Its country control had been seen as a sort of liberation, the return to security.
Afghans have paid the price of the darkness of their peasants overflewed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today.
The old Mujaidins, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, being made with government lands to resale them as solar for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from the couple of huge US subcontracting contracts.
They are untrustworthy; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, hope for a government that is not formed by thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have learned to take advantage of American generosity: the escape of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their advantages.
With about 65% of its population under 25 years of age, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state colleges are filled with both girls and children.
There must be work for those young people who do not want to return to the darkness of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All of them, including armed opposition, are equipped with mobile phones. The television and its publications presenting a modern world have great admiration throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to lead the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet war are already concerned about the reconstruction of provincial militias, who will flee from central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains and strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of Western nations; however, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralised state, with a strong presidential power, by removing the position of the first minister existing since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular due to the elections planned in April 2014.
However, its country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even earlier.
No industry has restored its services, no packaging has been fixed, and major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing but fruit and vegetables are produced.
The priority lies in the private initiative.
In a country destroyed after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The dream that Afghanistan had enormous mineral wealth was expanding.
And that only added to the feeling that the Westerners were there to get rid of them.
No power to extract iron or copper minerals from the ground and no means of transport to export them through the mountains, no mining operation is available.
The Chinese have almost abandoned Mes Aynak's copper mines, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the vast Buddhist settlement and remain there as the most important employers in the province.
There will also be a need for Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country in which imports and exports are largely dependent, to restore their normal relations.
The French troops broke up on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: schools of girls, schools of children, a French department at the University, the French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, health and agricultural areas and support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the aim of "winning the hearts and spirits" and carrying out the impossible task of bringing aid and offensive actions together, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cymic), deleted in 2012, has brought and brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation in tens of mountain areas.
These works, eager to obtain local work, have helped to contain the resurrection: rice, posos, potable water, reforestation, fruit trees, solar protection and increase in crop areas.
What will we remember after two million euros in military spending?
A more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very hard in these valleys, which are often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
For them to be freed from the resurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small civilian, well controlled aid and to reach them directly.
A Constitution with forces in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in relation to the constitutional declaration, which gives it provisionally full power, it has decided to play all over it.
He took the whole world by surprise at Wednesday, when he announced that the Constitutional Assembly would vote for its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had given the Assembly two more months to complete its work.
And nearly two years ago, Egypt used a provisional text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial examples.
This new initiative has done more than increase the country's share.
For his opponents, the president continued in his "autocratic delirie" and continued "traiting his word" and "peturing the right".
By their partners, it is ensured that it is a step towards a faster end to the institutional and political crisis and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forced the brothers to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to recover a popular and democratic legitimacy while the Polish cause damage throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour of him, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this resource has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the people of Egypt: "or they vote for my text or I keep the full powers", powers that they are supposed to achieve with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in this strange environment in which 85 members of this Constitutional Assembly, Islamist in the vast majority, voted yesterday.
Most liberals did not attend the call.
By mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they thought they could not evaluate their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, replacement members, were added to all the arrests in the morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
As I expected, the articles voted in favour of unity.
The commentators are grateful, on the other hand, for the fact that one of the few discrepancys of the day has been expressed practically at the time of the prayer, so that several members of the committee came to the conclusion that the clock of the Constitution was wrong.
The text, which yesterday was still voting, contains 234 articles.
Article 2 of all views remains the same as the 1971 Constitution, which states that "the principles of the Sharia constitute the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "the principles" could be replaced by "the rules", which would have allowed a stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their good will and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
The liberals hold it out of hypocrisy and consider it to be nothing more than a advertising article.
According to them, the Islamicization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which confers on the University of Al-Azhar a consultative role, in particular for all who must confirm their compliance with Sharia laws.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "people called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the premises of a theocracy."
The fear of liberals is further increased by the fact that the next director of this university would be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution we are in the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on that text are not ignorant but university students, some of whom are formed in the French system," explains Alexis Blueet, who prepares a thesis on the constitutional transition from Egypt.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, as the terms employed imitate the religious vocabulary.
"We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that could be raised in the future would be the extent to which civil judges are competent to speak above all of this."
In addition to its religious nature, yesterday's text has received many criticisms regarding the extended powers entrusted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers will claim that they are few in comparison with those who were during the previous regime.
Another point of conflict: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the revision of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
There will also be no ban on the processing of civilians in military courts, as requested by the human rights defence associations.
They also expressed their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberal.
The crime of blasphemy remains and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially in the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, under the heading Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only positive has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with Article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
Although the President of Egypt had to go out in the evening on television, demonstrations were planned for this afternoon.
State Chief's party members showed up on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await the holy land, the world's obligation and a salt sea
The Promised Land combines the majesty of Bible truths with modern comfort and a noble nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons for visiting Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal pill" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of Jesus ’ miracles: the turning of water into wine in the wedding, walking over the water, covering the storm and the full nets.
At the same time, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the largest number of holy places is in Jerusalem.
The believers here use the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (Latin "Via Painful Life").
Starting at the Fortaleza de Antonio, the Pretoria, where the trial was carried out, and continues along the streets of the Old City, he goes to the Holy Sepulcro in Mount Gólgota, the place of the crucifixion, the Stone of the Union and the place of Jesus ’ burial.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian obligation of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place for the Jews, the Wall of the Lamentation; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
As tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with their wishes, which will then become reality.
Perform a vertical journey
The ruins of the Massed Fortaleza were what remained of a secret shelter against the enemies, which Herod the Great ordered to build in 25 C.E. for his family.
It is located on the mountain slopes at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there by their own means, only those who dedicate themselves to the ladder.
The others can reach this historic summit in the fungal.
And in the north of the country to a height of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermón ski station, where in winter there is a great flow of tourists.
To that end, bus services are offered from the foot of the hill.
The total length of ski tracks is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, on the top of the mountain they were supposedly inhabited by pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
On a single trip, you can't visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Israel Parliament).
It preserves the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls or Scrolls of Qumran, discovered in the caves in the desert of Judea, and some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological parts.
It is worth visiting the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
In its exhibition of paintings there are links of impressionists and expressives such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha pool, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish bathrooms with models of visitors and bathers at that time.
In Caesarea it is worth passing through the exclusive private Ralli museum, where the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí can be admired.
There are no tourist guides or memorial stores there.
The entry is free, and donations are not categorically accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas cameras.
Get into it and find you in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And they call the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea even in winter months, the water temperature is not lower than 21 degrees and the air is warm up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is still warmer and there it is bathed throughout the year.
Of course, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point of the planet: 417 m below the sea level.
The blue waters there are a salmon that easily sustains up to those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes of the surrounding areas are really beautiful.
People come here to go through treatment courses with salt water, salt and curative bars and strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergy, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronquitis, diabetes and to order their nerves.
Touching the mysteries of the past
It preserves the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
For her it was the famous sea route that united Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to the legend, he was here where Noah built his ark and Perseo saved the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists like to walk through the narrow streets that bear the names of the signs of the Zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your "imism" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa there are recently married couples from all parts of Israel, including other countries to take pictures.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can pass through the Roman theater, "take" the strength of the crucified.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The theater, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Remember Tourists
If you travel to Israel, don't worry if your English leaves much more than you want: in this country about 30% of the Russian-speaking population.
Money for this trip is not recommended to carry it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to sharks (currently 1-3$,8 sharks).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast transit and in Haifa there is the only subway line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Low City with the High City.
In fact, it's a underground funnel.
Traveling in any type of public transport costs 6 sachets and this price can be made by crossing for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, Sabbaths are celebrated on the Sabbath.
From Friday night to sunset, markets and shops will close and public transport will interrupt their work.
But Sunday morning begins a new working week.
In many coffees, restaurants and hotels, only kosher food is served, which excludes meat from cheese, marsco, fish without shoes and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There it offers a wide selection of dishes based on beef and goat meat, soups and dishes prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a large variety of salads, the falafel, which are molluscs, fruit and vegetables.
In the streets of the Israeli cities there are no street dogs.
Instead, there are many well-fooded cats that "have their tastes" impertinently.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of the parked cars.
The roundabouts love the competitive places and do not reject the golosins.
The rental of a car, depending on the brand, will cost $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audio A6, Volvo S80) a day.
Besides insurance, it's $15 a day.
And the renter of a bike will deliver you 15 sachets a day.
The entrances to the museums cost an average of 30 sachets.
Israel in Numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
Most of those who arrived to travel and rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, an amount exceeding 51% at the same rate as in 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will bring you to Moscow: immigrants save for language
While Members and human rights defenders are discussing the consequences of the mandatory review law, fearers who trade with "false" certificates have already appeared in the country.
Each year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Your only goal is to earn money to help your family who have stayed at home.
Since 1 December a law has entered into force, whereby each migrant must carry out an examination to verify their knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, community services institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, with time, as promised in the Federal Immigration Service, exams will be mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, it will not be sufficient to make the language review, unless it is also the Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Language knowledge should be confirmed even in order to receive and renew the working permit.
Citizens of the countries where Russia is the official language are excluded.
Those who obtained their certificates of education and diplomas before the Soviet Union resolution in 1991 shall not be subject to this law.
Benefits, fetility and rights defence
The network of review centres will operate under the auspices of the Institute of Russian Language Pushkin, the University of Amistad de los Pueblos, the State University of Moscow, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants can be tested in all cities, and now in Russia more than 160 centres of this type are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights defenders, long before the law came into force, were able to ask the press this question: And what will it really bring?
What changes will result from the obligation to know the language, both for the Russians and for the immigrants themselves?
Firstly, the representatives of the Immigration Service respond, which will allow the number of people suffering "working slavery".
Many people today talk about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of his rights must be initiated before his departure.
Only an organized selection system will allow the problem of migrant workers to be resolved in 90 per cent of cases.
The problem is that immigrants have no profession, education, language, or medical control.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebrev says that the immigrant's future will be condemned to find people who, with the intention of helping him, put a "paying trip" into an exciting and tight coat, where he and dozens of others like him consume for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received a number of complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they promise something, but when they arrive, they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they do not pay their promised wages," the Chief of the Employment Immigration Directorate of the Tajikistan Immigration Service, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't come in, boss!
However, while so many citizens of Central Asian republics wish to work in Russia recognize not only that they do not know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also that they write in their own language with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much your fault but your own misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, tayyikos can be given the pleasure of receiving normal primary education.
This is due to their families even having nothing to give to children, because they don't talk about wearing them, wearing them, and buying them what they need for school.
Upon reaching adolescence, these boys will be able to work for the first time.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they'll recognize it.
"One feels humble and lower."
However, with regard to the law on language, rights defenders point to an important point.
The examinations will be carried out only for immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no review and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome or prohibiting the passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that getting official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause is in bureaucratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legislation costs money: from twelve thousand to twelve thousand rubles.
However, a false registration can be made quickly and for just a thousand and fifty rubles.
Russian police employees know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and the cases of extrovation appear.
"We ask hundreds or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," commented the journalists of Tajikistan's citizen Umed Hushkadamov.
"Let's go, don't be touchy, buy a painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the law on the language, it was demonstrated that not only immigration registration documents could be false.
Several "false" language knowledge certificates have already been affected by the Federal Immigration Service staff.
The faked documents had been printed in standard colour printers.
Of course, new owners did not receive the gift: each immigrant, wishing to facilitate the work of passing the test, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official review procedure, which will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for a future is to protect the system against corruption so that "diplomas" cannot be bought, government officials and rights defenders convince.
To date, the authorities may promise migrant workers that they could not have successfully completed the examination of the first time to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian immigrants will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
The percentage of offences committed with registered weapons is quite low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes that the law be applied more rigorously with regard to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the government's reaction to the recent incidents: To appreciate shootings during wedding celebrations where there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, in which Apretar seven people lost their lives.
The police want to prohibit the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons from 18 to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma Security Committee and combating corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the reforms in the law on the possession of weapons would be brought to the Duma of the State in the near future.
Not all are satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by implementing the "hard hand policy".
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, require that such "unreasonably security" measures be rejected.
The percentage of vandalism acts with the use of registered weapons is minimal, commented to the BBC news service of Russia, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 fire crimes were committed during six months of 2012 by internal bodies, compared to the total of 1168 crimes recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are sure that stricter legislation in the field of civilian weapons will not be an inconsistencies for the offender to be led into the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow any weapon can be found at low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Providers: from factories to offices
The black arms market is provided through several channels.
The main channels are years, says Colonel Víctor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and in the Supreme State.
Screenshot of the web site that accepts weapons requests
The first, "army of the army or military", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were shot by Russian officials and the same caucasians," Baranets says.
The following type of "black weapon" is arrested by criminals and representatives of security forces.
Baranet explains that here are the weapons seized from police storage and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons are on sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
"There are evidence that some fires have been caused primarily to cover the lack," one exmilitar commented.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their arena granite.
"They have now disseminated private arms factories that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
One more source of the black market is contraband.
A large number of guns and amplifiers come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"They are there with their own production, sometimes artesanials, and a mafia that has organized the flow of weapons has been formed," explains the former military.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts have calculated what is the approximate participation of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problems Analysis and Planning of Public Management.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and of Rosstat, criminal bibliography and public access data from portals whose theme revolved around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market weapons have arrived there "on account of officials whose work is related to weapons", says the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the weapons originate from armed conflicts, 14 per cent of the cases are stolen during arms production and 5 per cent correspond to "illegal archeology".
The dependant of one of the arms stores, who asked his appeal not to be mentioned, said that the weapons found by illegal excavators have not been bought from anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers are directed to military stores when they need a game.
Through some offer, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
The removals of the record and the passage above the valley.
"This takes the gun to the city and sells it to 900 euros per unit with two carriers," we read
"But, of course, the police are doing so much of all matters, so periodically, when the crime detection plan has to be met, they make evidence purchases to illegal arms dealers," adds the dependant.
"As in a luxury shop"
The seller and the buyer often find themselves through knowledge.
"Visit web pages and blogs until a guy I've proposed to go to "Begovaya" platform where he would be a man who would take me to a "squinita" where we could negotiate.
From the price of the weapon, I'll only get in there."
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the shop manager. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him much."
In the markets there are sellers, but there is also a need to arrive, we say "on behalf of Mr Ivanovich, who asked him to tell him that a tooth had fallen on his daughter."
I can even get a pair of steel handles through a trusted person.
He also provides them to me only because he knows I'm not going to let you down.
New ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Viktor Baranets was tested in the role of the purchaser of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when an article was available on this subject.
The schematics, according to their words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there wasn't "all."
"I felt like a luxury shop," recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Baranets, does not offer a cat for free: everything that is available can be tested.
I, as potential customer, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a white one.
"Give me the opportunity to shoot and when I'm sure that the weapon is well shot, we start negotiating," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofo Store
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No document or personal meetings are required for this purpose.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write on the headline "Buy a gun or a trigger."
There users make their requests and ask questions.
And sell the minors?
"No permission, of course," asks the user "Iván" (contained spelling).
"Compro gun TT. Moscú", literally formulated his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of physical websites and captures two hands to those who want to buy firearms.
And the people go, like wild fish towards the grass, and then, to extract carbon in Siberia.
military commentator and excommunicator Viktor Baranets
I have heard about these systems: the website is generally registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People make requests.
The buyer makes the payment through an automatic cashier.
"In response, they send you a photo and instructions for you to know where the weapon is hidden," reported NGO Press Secretary Dmitri Kislov.
Victor Baranets claims that if a request is made online, one will remain unarmed and put him in prison.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of physical websites and captures two hands to those who want to buy firearms.
"And the people go, like wild fish to the grass, and then, to extract carbon in Siberia," he says.
Macarov per $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, experts say one can spend from $100 to 900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms", a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
A month and a half is to be expected.
It is sent from military storage by middle-ranking officers.
According to the official statistics of the ministry, compared with the January-October 2011 period, the total number of these crimes in Russia was reduced by 7 per cent, which is 22,900, and the number of cases identified as theft and destruction of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8 per cent.
Fast-food restaurants and supermarkets in the United States are under arrest.
Up to a quarter of U.S. teenagers find their first jobs as cats in "McDonald's"
In the last days, a wave of protests have been launched in the United States against low wages in Walmart's supermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Freed Chicken".
For now, no one dares to know whether or not this wave will arrive at the nine points, or whether it is intended to lose forces and fall into its first stages.
The protest actions include the support of trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages achieved by Walmart workers and those of the fast-food system, the objective of protest organizers is to create trade unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has virtually not been occupied by the union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after the Day of Action, called "Black Fridays". That day, in the United States, the renegotiation organ that had captured millions of people, and sometimes was accompanied by confrontations.
That day, some workers from the Walmart Corporation, who employ 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and formed protests with trade unions and left-wing workers at the corporation's stores, whose products are directed to moderate and moderate incomes.
Walmart sells from everything, from clothes, hunting rifles and batteries for cars, to aspirators, eggs and milk.
The products in their shops are medium between 8% and 27% cheaper than those of the largest supermarkets.
That's why many ill-paid Walmart workers only buy at work.
The availability and output of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to two critics, Walmart can afford the luxury of selling products at very low prices, partly because it pays little to its employees.
These latter also complain of the bad working conditions, such as lack of mounts or hand scanners.
This "Black Friday" required increased salary and claimed that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation was 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 per hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average salary to $12 per hour, this will cost him $3.2 billion.
This is about 1.1% more than it costs in wages now.
If Walmart puts the wage increase on the consumer's men, each visit to the store will only result in 46 cents more expensive.
In one year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they now spend.
Walmart's supporters comment on the satisfaction that the protest took place only in nine states and that it did not cause any damage to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" extended in its shops from Friday afternoon to Wednesday the following day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its recording boxes carried out almost 100 million transactions on the "Black Fridays".
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview at the Huffington Post left office, that they left their job "less than five" Walmart employees and that the protest had been no more than "other public relations" organized by the union of workers.
"Free cup!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the targets were not exactly the large Walmart stores (which in this progressive city they do not appreciate, and so there is no one now), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he's selling thousands of millions of pieces, and then they don't even give you the disease drop and they don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumanee Williams, member of the New York City Municipal Council
Currently, according to the federal law and New York, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing with time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York City.
No one wins less than them in this city.
How it's possible to survive in New York with that money, it's something I don't understand.
There was a time when almost a quarter of the U.S. teenagers were passing by McDonald's and working there, behind the showers, for part time after school, though they still lived with their parents.
Few were those who saw this as the main source of income or were planning to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly miss some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live with this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal there is a comment that the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he doesn't know what to do with them.
Participants in the protests, which started at 6:30 a.m. on McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast food cooks be paid at least $15 per hour, i.e. double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be created in the fast food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits administration from prohibiting them from exercising this right and inflicting punishment on union activists with arguments and sentences.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the principals is the excessive rotation of staff.
Synchronising "%s"
Laughing protests took place that same day in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in mid-mixin in McDonald's near Times Square, where several local Democrats participated, in particular the municipal council member of Jumanee Williams, who said: "McDonald's says he's selling thousands of millions of pieces, and then he doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The protesters received support from other prominent Democrats in New York, for example from the candidate to mayor of the city Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support workers in the fast food sector in order to achieve fair wages and the economic prosperity that each neo-Yorkino deserves".
As New York Times reported, this has been the greatest manifestation of this type in the American history of fast food.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, even not all of them were employed in the fast food service, where tens of thousands of people were employed in New York.
It is still unclear whether this will be used as a chip to cause massive movement.
"For now, cheating on the brain isn't that easy."
The topic of the increased reality, so popular among those associated with modern technologies, is most commonly recognized through special gloves.
At the beginning of the summer, at its annual Google conference, a model was demonstrated in motion and subsequently, in November, it was assumed that Microsoft had also submitted a request to claim the relevant patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at Cambridge Microsoft lab, Izadi Sharamom, it was clear that for the scientists of that company, the gloves were already in a previous stage.
They attract them to the perspective of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with the naked hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the subject of your research group's study?
- We're dedicated to personal-computer interaction, but we're also trying to extend the limits of this interaction.
For now, mankind in its great mass has been trapped in the working phase with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes playing it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in control by gestures.
- What else does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has taken the interaction to the physical level, most of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems based on different technologies, including design.
The computer world must be freed from our, the physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around it.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, the devil with those stupid tons of virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they appreciate it?
- Of course you can't be considered a panacea, it's continuing to resolve the issue of privacy, because it doesn't always want others to understand our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but everyone in their own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we think about gestures, but not in simple movements, but rather short.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a pulse that recorded the movement of bones and muscles.
For now it is very big, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a pulse watch.
But in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this bowl of soda?
You'll talk and show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- Or do you want to force users to adapt to what you can or can't do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I believe that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the person's reactions.
These can, for example, be laser sensors, as they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we're talking about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have from modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth, or something else?
- In principle, the present generation can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 fps speed.
But the question is not in megapixels, but in the quality of matrix and depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
Either way, we have to remember not only the resolution in X and Y axes, but also in Z.
It is also important to speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 fps are really low, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our lab in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay from 1 to 100 ms and it should be mentioned that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects man-machine interaction.
It would be very useful for me to work on an equivalent of such a device, but it does not require contact so that the tables per second are more.
- And don't you need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually the infrared radio transmitter and the second receiver of the reflective signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visual range.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Maybe more cameras could solve the problem...
Or, on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the camera location curve and see how this would help to determine the three-dimensional position.
- That's why I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, hasn't presented his gloves to the public.
Does it not seem to you that from the point of view of the daily use of increased reality technologies, gloves are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, passing all the mouse holding an intelligent phone at the top is not very comfortable, but I think the best option would be an increased "transmutable" reality when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could pass through the gates to the smart phone,
The gloves are very personal devices, in which it is your strength (private things you can only see), but also your weakness: an increased reality based on gloves will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the film "Iron Man", but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often point to: there is no tactical answer!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers do your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my conferences I often say that the increased reality is the seventh interruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could be the addition of tactical sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as support for the image.
Record the tattoo perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly oriented to bring to these "images in the air". For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is found with a similar feeling that one feels if someone was planning it on the fingers of the fingers, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also buttons for the mucus that affect the nerve endings of the fingers, this is also a promising direction.
- Did you try to trick the brain?
Make him think he feels what he's supposed to feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried yet.
Here is another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space creates that goes to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of running tapes (not like those of the gymnasiums), mobile platforms, as well as the giant globes.
Now, cheating on the brain isn't that easy, it still has to work for many years.
That is what makes work attractive with virtual reality for researchers, which many things are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste in place of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens who are in front, to the Watch Tower of Art and Culture.
In this list of the best, there are brilliant figures of art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements are far beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is extravagance artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known by Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red clothes from above, where you can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Garden of Verano or in fashion and opening meetings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract the crowds, wherever they want to show themselves.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosophics of San Petersburg, creating new mythology.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the late 80 ’ s - 90 ’ s vanguardism in St. Petersburg.
In addition, he is a urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city awakens in the soundry inhabitants and rises up to all the state of mind.
Recently, he took an organ in his hands and became an organist in St. Petersburg, since he has matured to make such a difficult role because of his existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going through the red city and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color because I'm fashion designer and I'm dedicated to appearance and image.
In this world, the red color is a compromise between the artist, the artists of images and society.
Although in society, all that is not a little gray is due to aggression and aggression of good properties.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocation actions is an invitation to the debate.
- When did you realize you were supposed to be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Culture Palace, where my work was shown.
He told me that it was my way.
Then the oil of old non-official artists had ended, and the new, free like me, were still incomprehensible.
I became a friend of artists of the new island, with the posters that appeared in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new island was already over.
I was brought up in the theater by clothes, by the music of all generations, but not by letters.
And all of this came together in your art clinic... it was important for me to find myself in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds should be gathered.
In 1995, he occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical club, a bohemio club, the house of the bohemia of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember how Schnur brought the project to the "Van Gogh's ear".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under the phonograph, wearing adjustable pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group began to play live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was an encouragement to many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih.
We gave them Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of their great career; basic education and training were received from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Cub Griboyedov Club, are the rest of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and Asian customers.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was conducted in the press, the award was "The People of Our City".
In the title "Artist of the Year" I was elected, so I finished my graduation.
In these new times it is not easy to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our times it is easy to make popular, but culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very little cult.
- There's something that's understandable in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly express the present and the event.
I'm going to do a program exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Payas."
Kids are a temporary category.
I used to be social, but now being like this is painful and terrifying.
But in the countries everything is packed and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world through a comprehensive and mandatory change of clothing.
Now they're going after one by the clothes, looking outside, but not inside the person.
And, maybe that person doesn't have to hand it to him or her, but get him out of his face.
And the trick will be removed when it changes to clothes.
We've seen you in the role of urban organist.
What better than I'm to be!
- Okay, but can the best trade art be beautiful?
- Now the commercial art must be sculpted, sweet, touchy.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before the people were grouped in mandas, the bohemians wanted one thing, the other simple ones.
Now everyone has divided into microcommunitys, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred bucks ticket to like everyone.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to listen to St. Mikhailov comes for thousands!
- They're gonna see him leave, there's the sex-social field.
And at a cultural event there are 300 people, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything goes away.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to lose what you have achieved.
When he was young, he made such paintings that a collector had them on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end up.
Now the concepts are often confused.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that's another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, raised under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, who refused money just to paint paintings.
I'm in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing from St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: cultural officer.
But not all of them can dedicate themselves to culture.
When the kings were the right ones all were otherwise, the kings may not have understood the culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are now very good consultants in Moscow.
We have people in San Petersburg who could be experts, but they're closed, because they need experts at a higher level who evaluate them correctly and open their way.
Now it's promoting subjective personal taste.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's the matter with you, St. Petersburg?
San Petersburg is not a cultural capital. There's a lot more culture in Moscow, there's land.
But on our stones it's hard for art to grow.
We need cultural land and now we have more writers than readers, this is bad.
In Europe there are a number of people with curiosity who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is infinity.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Lighten up in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or shock with a killer asteroid.
Spacecraft caravans with people on board begin looking for a resting planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is: How to continue the species in conditions of intrusion or on the same planet of rest?
I think there's a few places to choose.
In fact, only two are real planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetical.
"These are Venus and Marte," says researcher chief of the State Astronomic Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions in Marte are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
Only you can live at great heights or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
The problems of playing in space with the flower began to be addressed.
Half a century ago experiments with plants were carried out.
Four generations of orbital giants did not differ in any of the earth's diversity.
Then came the creation of insects in the orbit, small pieces of fruit, drosophiles.
In 1979, codonism eggs were sent to the area to check how embryonic conditions develop.
We've got a normal pollinator.
But then they start problems.
"The problem is that this pollster has to find support, must keep on his own feet and start moving," says Vladimir Sychev, director of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
When they didn't find support, the cops turned around.
And after 10 hours in recent births, a total stroke of instincts was given.
The cops didn't react to the light or the sound.
And the tragedy was that at the end of four days they just died.
"And twice we got the pollutants born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them," comments Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the pollinators in space.
The last time a biological "miniar" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, experiments will continue.
However, in "Bion" biosatellite, only species of the same sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to the space with flowers already.
At first, there was nothing supernatural.
"This was precisely in biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out," comments Vladimir Sychev.
After the earthquake, the space rats had offspring.
However, it has not been possible to address the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, when losing their normal habit, simply cannot perform their sexual instincts.
Unlike small animals, however, man can at first.
The wise man has abstract reasoning and is able to create an adequate emotional fund.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling to space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female body.
Our pilot flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it's after a flight to space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," commented the Veteran of the Vakhtang Vachnadze airport sector.
In June 1964, only after one year of flight to space, the first cosmonaut woman, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The daughter's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in the open space, had a child.
However, the risk persists.
We're few, the astronauts are told who after long flights all have been well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if it can be said more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," said the cosmonaut pilot, Soviet Union hero, Russian hero, Valery Polyakov.
However, mankind must look for some new ways to biotechnology, radiological protection, and the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaborator of the Cosmonauts Training Centre is a mandatory step in flight preparation.
In terms of zero flotability, cosmonauts practice their working skills in space.
Water simulates ingraviation.
If for an adult the water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child is its natural element.
Small anfibio men seem to confirm that life on earth originated from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months inside her mother in amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for her to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the time of birth to the time of the first bath, only 2 weeks pass.
"This is very little to forget," says Marina Aksenova, a newborn birth monitor.
In summary, if ingraviation is a more natural state for a recent birth, women need gravity, gravity force.
In the indreviation of the abdominal muscles and the pelvis, the ability to expel the foetus is reduced very quickly.
Well, let's forget that, trusting in the action of incentives for birth.
You can, of course, give the light in a special camera, it will push it.
"And then what?" Valeri Polyakov asks this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscle system.
To a newly born in orbit it is impossible to wear it with a special suit for training, such as adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we're going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will allow us to bring the Earth to a completely disabled person," the head of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, with time this will be a reality, when human beings in their ships are heading to a distant planet that will be home for their children born in space.
Head of NKU: The inspection of the "schvarc" system has not given the guilty political
In the case of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its application is consistent.
This is how Miloslav Kala, vice-president of the Office of Control Supreme (NKU), says in an interview for Aktualnë.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we need," explains the current situation.
Joint controls of Czech and German inspectors also lead to similar conclusions.
As an example of wrong practice, it mentions Petr Nečes' attitude towards the system of autonomy only on the paper, which is known as the "schvarc" system.
The first minister recently said that the ODS (Civil Democratic Party) would not bother businessmen with inspectors. So is it prohibited or permitted?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits anything, in that case neither the President of the Government can prevent the conduct of the office which has the obligation to carry out such controls nor to require obligations," Kala observes.
At the meeting of the Committee of Supervisors at the Congress of Members, U.S. spoke of the common project between the Czech and German teams, which compared legislation on public procurement in both countries.
What exactly is it?
It's a parallel control that we started doing a couple of years ago.
This is simple: European legislation regulates how public procurement is to be organised, followed by existing legislation in each country and then practice itself.
We have all agreed and, although the control has not yet been completed, we have got very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation of our country is "more stricter and more complete", however, the practical practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate more strict rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
What can contribute to this project? What do you think are the conclusions?
It is precisely a common control of this type that could help us to stop investing in the implementation of laws, reduction and improvement of borders, although this does not have such a positive impact.
The savings economy means getting something suitable at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) in order to avoid wealth and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not by reducing the threshold of the tenders, that is, we're going to get it.
Perhaps because the system is satisfactorily satisfactorily satisfactorily, so those who want to find errors on the system can do it more easily than if the limits remain as high as they are now.
You are talking about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation that regulates the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKU or is it organized differently?
With regard to offices such as the NKU, the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), with an organization similar to ours, also with a colleague, is the only one that is structured in a different way, but in principle both offices evolve simultaneously.
Competences are also very similar, however, as Germany has a federal organization, the accounting courts are located even at this level. In this respect, however, they clearly differ from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, as we call state funds here.
Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
With regard to local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to establish a comparison without specific data. However, Germany is still a model in some respects, but it cannot be exactly what is best.
Could it be better, for example, with regard to the quality of inspectors?
That's sure not, but, again, I don't like making this kind of comparison.
It must be said that even those countries we take as a model have to deal with a large number of problems.
If it wasn't like that, I wouldn't give them any benefit to cooperate with our office, wouldn't you?
With regard to the legislation of our country, what did the amendment to the law on public procurement mean to your Office? Does it somehow show its impact?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been demonstrated in control actions.
Since we carry out ex post checks, we have to count on a certain delay.
It is now noted in the future control preparation process: we have launched a new "non-economic risk detection" tool, whereby we have made almost 14,000 public procurements, which have been analysed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are changed, the conditions of some types of the selection and similar process are corrected.
Do you consider that the adoption of this law is beneficial, or is it, rather, an example for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope it will be.
The problem that may arise is that the rule "is being shaken" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
Already under previous legislation, controlled persons were linked to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and each non-compliance with public procurement law meant breach of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense, then, to break the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who wish to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal mistake, which does not have an impact on decision-making.
A system of this type will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We'll see where this started path leads us.
The first Minister has recently stated that the ODS would not disturb businesses with controls of the so-called schvarc system, with reference to the fact that they are autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the black system prohibited or permitted?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits anything, then not even the first Minister of the Government can prevent the performance of the Office which has the obligation to carry out such controls and to require obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and allow it," but you can't say we'll do it like nothing.
In the law on public procurement, the legislation is quite strict as to how it should act formally, and that is how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate is excluded from the best offer by failing to meet the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct.
The roads offer ice plates, although most of them are transparent
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads have ice and snow plates.
Although most roads are transparent, caution must be exercised in some cases.
Karlovy Vary Region
Today morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were translatable, but they presented ice and snow plates.
The temperature drops and will oscillates between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
He has stopped snowing in the region and the low areas of snow is finished.
On the other hand, the snow reaches almost 30 centimetres in the heights of the Metal Mountains.
In some places visibility was still poor due to snow, according to information from the regional road control centre.
The rapid R6 road and the first-class road in the region are now translatable without restrictions.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially in some points where the surface can be frozen and rebalancing.
Also, all roads of second and third categories, including mountain roads, are also translatable.
However, in some of them there are still wires with ice residues and aprisoned snow.
More attention is needed on the road, especially in the highest areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
In some East Bohemia roads there is a danger of heat and higher areas and in the mountains a snow layer may have been formed on the roads, reports on its pages the Roads and Motorcycles Directorate.
Road operators warn drivers about the danger posed by ice plates, especially in areas higher than the Pardubice region.
They can be produced in the immediate stages of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially in the second and third categories.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads from the mountains of Krkononische to Orlické hory.
There is a snow layer in the higher areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Knžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of East Bohemia, the sky will be now between disintegrated and partially clouded, without precipitation.
The temperatures will generally oscillate between three low zeros and a positive degree, resulting in a weak wind.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen region are transparent this morning, although caution will need to be exercised and it will need to be adapted in time.
In the first hours of the morning, temperatures will be around three to nine degrees below zero.
After the snow and the subsequent fall of the temperatures, some roads could also be covered by ice.
In some places drivers will meet with snow, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what is learned from the information from the Regional Road Control Centre.
Autopista D5 is almost unlimited, although caution is recommended, especially on the road between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The surface of most first-class roads is dry and ice free.
In the Pilsen and Tachov border road area with Germany there may be wires with ice plates.
The second and third categories are wet roads, so in this case, we also warn of wires with ice plates.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially in the less-traded roads in the area of Šumava.
Olomouc Region
Drivers headed to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will meet with partial snow.
After the chemical treatment, it was still snowing at the port of Červenohorské and on the road towards Videlský křijž.
The road operators removed the snow during the night; they gathered about three centimetres of snow in the Shumper road, according to the road administrators.
In the rest of the region, most roads are accessible without restrictions.
"In the higher areas of the Schumper road, there are snow residues.
Drivers in the port of Červenohorské will meet with medium-distance snow towards Jeseník", a driver of the ČTK Čumper road administration has confirmed today.
On the ground and in the night they also came to Jesenická with their colleagues, and after the chemical treatment, the tracks of the highest areas are now disbanded and moved.
On the road of Olomouc the roads are translitible without restrictions, in Šternbergská drivers should drive cautiously in forest traffic, where the roads continue to be wet.
Region of Ustí nad Labem and region of Liberec
The road operators in North Bohemia have reported complications in different stages at the first hour of the morning.
Apart from some places in which he has snowed or frozen, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Knínce in the Ústí nad Labem region is closed.
The temperatures are kept under zero, even in the lowest areas, so the ice and snow are obviously remaining in the shoe. However, in the lowest areas, especially in the western central Czech coast, there are no problems and roads, generally dry.
No service complications have been recorded for the moment.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in around Štétí.
According to meteorologists, conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day rain and snow are expected to fall and in the night the sky will be dissolved and there will be ice.
The General Roads have announced adverse conditions on road I/13, on the border between the Ústí nad Labem and Liberec region.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut down by branches of the trees that had been arched over the road with the weight of the snow.
Shimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in less than a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It's just one of so many other alarmed news that we like to catch up with.
The Tap Tap music group prefers us to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to expose the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organized a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
It's a state benefit act that we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the May calendar announced for 21 December at 11:10 a.m.
On the day before, 20 December at 21 hours, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end about the same time as the May calendar on the island of Kiribati, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours before our time zone.
Who did this idea happen to him?
Initially it was my idea, then we were building the project all together with our Honza Augusta designer.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of May's calendar we have also created a single collection of articles: boots, shirts, bags and originals against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, together with other interpreters, also sang the so-called himno against the end of the world, which is entitled "The End of the World, Canceled".
Currently it's very popular on YouTube, can you listen to the beneficial concerts?
Of course, yes, and it will be the last, well, whenever everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
All interpreters will sing it at the same time in the three concerts.
Immunos will be connected at the same time thanks to the special retransmission directly on Czech TV.
Tomáš Hanák has written the letter of this song and interprets Jesus' protagonist role in the video clip, where Xindl X...
How did this collaboration arise?
We work together with other characters of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many beneficial acts and concerts...
Let us make every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested in them and enjoy working with us.
What will money be spent on concerts against the end of the world?
The equipment for the educational centre without barriers Studio, which we have completed in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkóv úst.
Students from the Jedličkóv school receive regular visits from teachers who perform interesting and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient economic means to pay teachers and we make an effort to do so.
In the framework of the completion of the work at Jedličkův institution, there will be an independent building to which we will be transferred with this project.
In each concert, several groups and interpreters act.
What are the selection criteria?
We are trying to develop an attractive programme for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague they will act in Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustrato Sphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchi.
For more detailed information, see www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other similar "expective action" in the future?
In May we will take action for the first time at the Pražské Jaro festival, so we will certainly prepare here an attractive program with interesting guests.
The next year, we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and to me, personally, taking advantage of that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with actions in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not exactly minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group formed by people with disabilities.
How are the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not as difficult as it might look like first sight.
There are five members in electric wheels chair, the chairs have to travel to the equipment compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have arranged them well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which does not surprise me.
Even in Moscow, where we came back a little ago, everything came out without problems.
With foreign exits, you can compare the different attitudes of society to those with disabilities and other aspects.
What have you found so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have been witnesses that, on this one, there is a lot of road to travel.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there remains no time for a person to move alone through the city centre in an electric wheel chair.
Something as current as it is, for example, to prefer someone in wheelchairs in elevators, there isn't.
Fortunately, a civil partnership has been established that seeks to mitigate the problems of people with disabilities.
In what areas should we take the example of more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're going back to...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation are always dependent on those directly affected.
In London and Madrid it is very common for people with severe disabilities to move to their public account and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities participate in social life actively, in this respect, with The Tap Tap we are a little ahead!
A respected or without barriers society is a thing, but when it comes to the time when prominent sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will start to change everything.
So far, there are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look back a few years ago, what led them to form the group in 1998?
I entered the educational institution of Jedličkóv, where I had many young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxofon, founded a amateur group with a workmate.
And in time, as our moderater Ládža Angelovic says, we were a few of the hands (riss).
However, the popularity has not reached its end in recent years, or am I mistaken?
It is true that it has helped us enough to connect with famous singers and also work actively to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen is as if it does not exist.
With the help of the European Union, we can also be allowed to train teachers of quality, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to get so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I saw the potential there was, which could be done differently.
The world of the show is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its own way, that all the new is being welcomed with caution and long-term acceptance.
There are a few strange things, but I'm afraid to say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not left to suffer and of whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, of course, on the condition that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it's not just a move for them, it's for the whole society.
Did it help to make you a demanding boss, how does he describe many people?
If we want to do a quality job, we must be strict in many aspects and require certain discipline.
I think it's totally normal.
Some people come with a romantic vision and with their head in the clouds and when they realize that they have to spend two days trying, going to the preparatory test and spending a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly leaves them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
Currently the group The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were already in the beginning of 1998?
Only one: Lady Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come in and out, we can't avoid it.
Anyone who has will and gains will always find open doors.
It will be the day before the end of the world, Thursday, 20.12.2012 at 21 p.m.
It will take place in the Incheba Arena of Prague, in Brno Square and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate in 12 groups and other music from the Czech Republic
The three cities will be connected at the end of the evening through videoconferencing to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the World, Canceled"
The aim of the concert is to gather the resources needed to finance multifunctional equipment from the educational centre without barriers to the Study in Jedličkóv ústa de Prague, whose cost amounts to 25 million Czech crowns.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years of age have free entry in the Bohemiaticket sales option
Poland and the cosmos.
At the Ministerial Meeting of the European Space Agency held last week, Poland was accepted as a twelfth member of ESA. It is the second member country of ESA of the former Eastern Europe block following the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and has participated in the Agency's project committee for the following years.
However, the path of Poland to the cosmos began a long time ago.
Polish enthusiasts had already dedicated themselves to flights to space before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I recall, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld at the astronomical observatory of Warsaw, in which, on 6 December 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneer study "Introduction to cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the indifferent audience and, years later, Šternfeld remembered that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie prize in France and André Louis Hirsch for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a major promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a cosmonautist, known all over the world, and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was placed on one of the craters of the moon's hidden face.
Already in 1925 a trailer was built in Poland that was to be provided by a car engine.
Unfortunately, it is not known who was the author of the proposal and the details of the project are not known.
It is not clear whether the coat was to be used for the start of the dress or for its brake.
The information on this dress is limited to the collection in the press of the day.
From 1933 the Polish artillery began to be dedicated to the missiles.
The investigation was funded by Komörka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfek and Prof. Gustavem Mokzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it is evident that the investigation has reached the stage of practical evidence.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 he appeared in the specialized press the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by engineer Rohozinski and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpeda powitrzna and rakietbombamba lotnicza", by author Lelya-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for military use of missiles engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczaswow Committee Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all mission techniques for military use and coordinated all work.
The Committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautique).
The November 1954 issue of the magazine Problem refers first to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronomy.
One of them, Professor Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched, and it was evident that space research was a discipline with perspectives for the future.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) had hoped to be part of the International Federation of Astronauts (founded in 1951) and in October of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice-President of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He completed this task until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has participated significantly in the development of RM probe (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which has been a success and has become the first Polish cohete in which scientific research has been carried out.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first launched on 10 October 1958.
The cohete had a length of 1,800 metres, about 80 cm long and was not reached at 5 kg weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 air tests of two stages of RM-2 cohetes began in the desert of Błdów.
The coke measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of developmental coke was to be a real scientific study. The RM-34 cochete was to have a support of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the wind of height.
However, the work was suspended in 1962.
The successor of the first RM rocket type was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-phase catch, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which were different from the space available for scientific devices.
The space available for the volume was 0.4 litres, 0.44 litres metre and 0.62 litres metre.
The maximum support in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 Cohete was developed in the Air Institute, whose first aircraft tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 cochete had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg to 60 km high.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were subsequently built.
It is also necessary to mention Poland's entry into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the National Committee of COSPAR two years later.
In the framework of the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined the space research on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercsmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the social work law is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court suspended the Social Labour Act.
The resolution raised an urgent debate in society.
Since then it will be interesting to consider the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Free economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic and regulatory competition.
As a result, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in constant conflict.
The case is at the beginning of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with the uninterrupted financial speculation.
The impact of large differences on labour costs (from wages) results in economic tensions.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to cut distances and thus "proposes a low price" of the competitor with the aim of making most of the market and thus increase its profit margin.
At a large scale, for most entrepreneurs, it means moving production abroad, buying there cheaper or well disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the labour price, compared with other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and therefore is not responsible for the unemployment generated by this phenomenon, the social cost of the state is growing necessarily.
All this situation contributes to the total disinterest of entrepreneurs by paying taxes and compensation for the economic and social damages they have caused in order to obtain benefits.
The situation is so universally known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistical data.
The low sculpted practices of private capital create situations in certain economies in which Governments of those countries are obliged to compete with the objective of artificially reducing the social level of their own population and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments have private capital available to their own population without taking into account social decline.
This is patented primarily in the changes in existing laws.
The objective is to force the population to accept the dictatorship of private capital, especially in respect of wages.
This is done by means of the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; and, on the other hand, by restricting the right of workers to labour rights.
The result is an increasing poverty together with increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, there have been food supplies in Germany for poor people who cannot keep up with their own work.
The number of people receiving this kind of aid is already up to a million.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, a very common case arises: people employed with a pay so low that the state must pay the rest to achieve the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind has been made public regarding the situation of the German Federal Parliament's assistant employees.
The measures to save virtually all the states of the south of the EU are undoubtedly leading to the same situation. People, forced by an ambitious decline of their social level, are forced to emigration as in the 19th century or to live with a low wage within society's borders, hoping that one day they will reach the private investor capital country.
Do you need to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never comes, since Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Morocco, Egypt or Africa continue to work for a very small part of a European salary.
This also affects all Latin America.
The liberal theories and the media claim that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, which leads to its failure.
The private capital defends the issue that the state should not intervene in the economy by entering into control.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence its selfishness in the political process and, therefore, throughout the state.
In this case the answer is clearly convincing.
The test is the existence of lobbyists, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all states.
The result is an unexpected situation in the area of corruption, in mutual favour, in a legislation that is practically reprovable in all but not criminal.
In Germany the situation is as follows: state ministries, without financial means, are responsible for drafting laws to private legal enterprises, which are often linked to industry.
This type of bill was adopted later in the Bundestag, the German Parliament.
Thus, all power does not come from the people, as it is announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is clear that democracies with a liberal orientation are fast in a situation like that described by Appians in their work The crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompey: "The state took time to deintegrate and administrations took control of the force."
Instead of bribes, benefits obtained illegally and help finance stones or swords.
The subordination and corruption were spread without interference, and the people flocked to the Urs with the above-mentioned vote"... "there were no people of a character who wished for a place in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consensus"... "I began to talk seriously about that the only remedy for a situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose a man of power"... Although Appians thought in Pompey, Caesar went up to power and turned democracy into autocracies forever.
The conclusion, in the same way as in the past, is that the current society is based on unconsidered preferences of individual benefit without taking into account the common interests.
Private capital cannot, in its essence, understand and claim the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same as then, a decade of the unprecedented elite, without an effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes should therefore be sought for the uninterrupted liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, such as a defined pause, pending the next attack.
The fact is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian disasters of which we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as well as those we know in ancient history and most recent.
The suspension of the law on public procurement is not the solution; at least not for a long time.
Under the pressure of economic competition at both the international and within the EU, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is through concrete socio-political reforms, which strengthen both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the chaos laboratory.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could," Sting in his Fragile song and whose strewn prayer "Let's do not forget how frugile we are" (we do not forget the frugile we are).
"If my children didn't want war, there would be no one" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in his death bed in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there have always been different reactions.
One side of Israel argues in favour of the right to self-defence and binds Palestinians in the role of terrorists. The other supports the Palestinians and declares racism by the State of Israel, genocide against Palestinian Arabs and strikes Israel as a terrorist.
I do not want to focus on who is responsible for the killings that are repeated periodically and who is the victim. Finally, today's citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born into the current political situation and did not live in the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a view behind the screen, a view to discover who is benefiting from the tension that has been drawing since 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) on a small land surface in the Middle East.
Some of my views are based on historical facts, others on conclusions that I have reached on the basis of my own way of understanding the matter, who or what group of people is the main promoter of the events of modern history.
In the history of mankind, the history of the battles by power is in the first row.
In every time we can find a Alexander Magno or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether these characters were always those who guided their steps autonomously or if behind their throne there was someone who directed their actions towards a particular goal.
We must accept that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated on a few individuals and that this concentration of money and power that this involves has not been achieved in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families is one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I don't know, but I don't know): the Rothschilds.
It doesn't write much about them.
Of course.
In the 1990s, they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with criminal acts of great severity. Power and wealth, or both, would cover their backs, which for them always meant strengthening.
They have important participations in almost all the world's central banks and in those countries in which they are not represented, have been declared or are preparing a war: before the attack on Afghanistan were 7 countries, after the Iraq attack were 5, after the defeat of Gadafi only four, but at the same time Russia has submitted the central bank to the Russian government.
Anyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Central Bank of America Bank of Rothschild's Central Bank, began during the Section War to print money and was murdered in 1865 at the theater.
JFK began to print money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was murdered in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was arrested in 1936 after wanting to ask the FED for the release of the big economic crisis in 1929.
His zeal for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by the Albert Pike mason, decorated with grade 33.
The first war was marked as the goal of eradicating the great monarchies throughout Europe; the second would eliminate colonial sovereignty, especially from Britain, and the third would be to reduce the population of the country between half a million and a billion people (a similar number of slaves for their well-being and luxury would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (Ecumenism is nothing more than a project for similar solutions) and the final adoption of absolute powers.
The method with which the group of the richest families, together with the Rothschildschilds, follows the dynamics of crisis decoupling and the subsequent provision of a solution (order ab cao - order from fall).
These solutions are, however, mistakes, and always lead to a deterioration of the situation. If not, it is enough to remember that the FED was created so that a crisis like the year 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the successful killing of the heir to the Austrian-Hungary throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after the outbreak of World War I, Russia was destroyed by the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unjustifiable from a military and economic point of view, Germany's capitalization (wars to end with Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent reminiscent of the great power of Central Europe, the Austrian-Hungary Empire.
In order to prepare the land of the Second World War, banks and politicians were allowed to create a conflict due to the enormous repairs of the war on Germany, which created the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impossible masses. Subsequently, they were forced to serve the Germans the Führer solution, which was sufficiently strong and simple and pointed to guilt, and then to build a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that should represent and represent both the function of the fifth column, which called for and caused the establishment of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that was inspired by the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judah with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the foundations for the massive Jewish immigration to Palestine and initiated the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
It was World War II: it was hard to know whether Hitler had taken too much of the courage to which the international banks had taken in principle or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the excellent conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in the world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way in which war repairs imposed on Germany led the way towards World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel, the focus for a third war was created.
If international banks were able to initiate it, the Jewish nation, just as in the Second World War, would become a victim in the first line of combat, now with the Arab population or, generally, the Muslim people of the Middle East.
Israel is an enormous laboratory, a machine of soldiers and helmets, not only within its country, but also at international level. Let us take as an example how the compassionate and detractors of Israel are so divided.
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does injustice lead to injustice in an inevitable spiral of violence, if at first it was the code of some individuals and their ancestors by worldly power?
In this respect, it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and its mandate, because, as is the case in our country, international banks only present their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of fascist policy, loyal to international banks, which makes it possible to declare war on Iran and, considering Iran as a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we consider Iran controlling Ormuz's tightness, where 20 per cent of the world's total oil (the navigation corridor has only two miles of its width), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Under what light are the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in its imagination is a world of gentlemen and slaves.
A world where the rest of the population serves as a handful of people who are part of well-accommodated financial aristocratic.
A world in which every new individual is introduced a chip at birth that controls his entire being.
"And everyone, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, must have a mark on the right hand or on the front, not being able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the figures of its name.
It is necessary to understand this: whoever has two fingers in front, who sums up the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred sixty-six."
Argo Film: If it's hard, call me Hollywood
In November 1979 a group of Islamic students attended the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
His release was to be replaced by the devastating Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who, after the revolution, fled to the United States, a country that had been sponsoring its regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation did not offer any positive perspective: drawing the Shah on the board could not be allowed, since, if it did, jeopardise the trust of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the reigns in Iran, where the revolution had broken out in the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not at its reach.
It was an attack on the U.S. prestige, which later intensified with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
Prisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention of the Government of Algeria.
In the U.S., his fate caused a wave of solidarity and animation against Iran.
The failure in Iran made a decisive contribution to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck is a episode of this story, which brought a small success to America.
Shortly before the embassy was occupied, six employees from the building escaped.
After a complicated periphery, they ended up in the Canadian embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, to help them find an exhilarating story: they went out with Canadian passports, as members of the cinematographic team that examined the location in the country for the circulation of a superproduction of fiction science.
Gender Combination
The plan that led the expert to "exfiltration" Toni Mendez required Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the lie seem true, it was written on the cinematographic project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, and the fictitious production society had even a real waste.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film was made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a single combination of several generations.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other hand, a "caper movie", the story of an episode that came out well, an illusion (an example can be the Ocean's Eleven series).
The film combines the state of mind. We find on one side well documented sequences of Tehran. The sequence of credit shows symbolic photographs of the time of events, which were plasmated in the same way in the film; there are no many differences in this respect.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes are much more vivid, marked by irony and a mild exaggeration.
In addition, scenes from the CIA center and other institutions: men who are brought in to analyze the situation at the negotiating table, at the offices' halls, by telephone...
Ben Affleck has been able to resume his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been subjected to noise, has become a respected director and his way of acting has ceased to be the blank of ironic comments.
Argo is its third long-term, after "Adiós Small, Adiós" (2007) and the Triller "The Town. City of Ladrons" (2010).
At the same time, it's Affleck's first film where the action doesn't take place in Boston, where it was created.
Also, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that placed the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Teher will be "red" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film have a place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the real events. The introduction sequence of the embassies is impressive because of its synoptic capacity that at the same time transmits the emotion of the misunderstanding and the lack of predictation that arises when, in some places, the story goes on.
Affleck and his colleagues have a similar effect on the fictional scenes (the crew imposed on the Teheran base).
Too many locations
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most interesting scenes.
And they are well arranged. Sometimes it adds something to the reality: here it does not come out so elegantly (the scene in which the crisis takes place in Tehran airport, the deviation of a call to America, and the uninterrupted search after its track turns into a hole).
Argo's flash is the decontrol that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very grateful role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters were worth more space and are not, not much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a little dramatic trace, but it's a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, value its performance and the retro style of a thriller who watches the 1970s.
But if it falls, that's gonna be hard.
As the evocation of a real story and as proof of the overwhelmingness that can be the notions of humnipresentity and munition of secret services, it is sufficient.
Rules for the inflation of globes, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which presents an annual survey on the most absurd banking rates, has now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU workshop".
"If it happened to us after the last incident, the EU is planning to adopt a quota of 40 per cent of women in positions of leadership in major European companies," explained Pravo Patrick Nacher, the director of the survey.
For example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance policies between men and women is among the absurdities mentioned.
To date, women have benefited from better prices in life insurance because they are objectively at a lower risk.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," Nacher reported.
For example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel is one of the EU's controversial regulations that, as a result, damages the environment; another prohibition is the use of mercury thermometers throughout life only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the directive sums up the size of the gallins' eggs, which has contributed to a considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
The actual prohibition of using the term "mantequill de untar" or the withdrawal of the classic trade bomb has been criticized.
A quality plate must have a length of 14 cm.
The Union apparatus shall make such decisions often under the pressure of one or more commercial or industrial lobby, whose applications in Brussels are usually defended by a state or group of states (the Czech Republic, including with the threat of veto, claims the requirements of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that more quality plates should have a length of at least 14 centimetres in the EU and could not present "normal curves".
The European Commission was defending itself by saying that it was only seeking to harmonise non-conformity national standards until the date, which had only complicated their marketing.
The standards referring to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive leads to food loss.
The candidate to win the survey could be the EU's requirement last year, which in the worlds which are marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under 8 years of age are not allowed to influence them without the supervision of an adult.
The EU was referring here to an American study that, when it comes to toys, the globes are the main cause of child death by asphyxiation.
There is also a similar restriction on the use of killers by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious events are even born in our country
Similarly absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: any who has an official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia; in order not to harm Greece's sensitivity, FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia) should be spoken of.
The Bankonnioplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, appointed, among some of the absurd proposals mentioned above, the requirement of the Union on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has determined the maximum quantities of food supplies that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
Later, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the volume set up for seed conservation, which was subject to a threat of substantial fines.
The investigators were also interested in the possibility of paying those countries that did not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the request for grants.
This kind of idea did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are disappointed at the fact that there is no sea.
We ask the European Union for compensation," said agriculture minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in October 2004.
He argued with the fact that much grain was produced in our country and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had full stocks and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from the seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission was willing to assist the Czech Republic and organized a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries with no access to the sea.
The grant for a grant was proposed to municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development, directed by Minister Pavel Njemec (US-DEU).
EU: Rare requirements are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often criticised, the EU's regulatory efforts and also more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve our recognition, according to several experts.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the sum of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but that Member States have achieved budget negotiations.
The Czechs are also affected by the sensitive fiber, as in other countries of the Union, by the struggle for the right to name their traditional products, although our country has not always been victorious in these wars.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of the Olomouc claim, but had to change its name to the national Ron, whose tradition in our country was re-examined in the 19th century, and became known as "tuzemak".
Only products produced from the distillation of sugar can be called round, but not those made from sugarcane.
In the official list of EU protected designations of origin, along with the fetish and gorgonsols known worldwide, the German city of Lübeck or the town of Parma, there are already some examples of the galleries of Karlovy Vary, the map of Pohorèlice and Třebonj, and also the variety of Žatec Žatec.
As the protected seas of the EU, they may be proud of the Pan de Gengibre de Pardubice and the Horíce Barquillos v Podkrkonoše.
People want to save the Republic, but I'm an affidavit, says Okamura
Mr. Senator, how have you been presented to the presidential elections?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything was all right in our country, then I wouldn't present my application.
But I can no longer bear to see how it is stolen in our country in the last twenty years, how the thieves are taxed, the taxes and the age of retirement are increasing.
I had no political ambitions.
When I see something that I don't like, I try to give you a solution to change it.
And since I am forty years old and my candidate is independent, the only possibility I have to change things is to present myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but shortly thereafter it has set itself on its way to the presidency.
Aren't you supporting those people who voted for it?
I have always said that my application to the presidency depends on the results of the Senate elections.
Later I had to make sure that if I was elected senator, I would present my application to the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can actually make my own ideas.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that criticises at the bar or in front of television, but that we blame anyone who wants to start a change.
This includes the media, which deplore you and confuse freedom of expression with freedom of lying.
I'm saying I've given journalists what I've been counseling Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
The presidential struggle with financial thesis and criminal liability of politicians and the statement of ownership over twenty million is presented.
To do so, you have to change the law.
As President, he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have become part of a pressure group so that the leadership office is recognized as self-employed work, and we have done so.
The problem is in politics: if anyone comes with a good proposal, whether right or left, he refuses to do so and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential for the support of all parliamentary groups.
With no linkages or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is better for our country and to apply it.
Is he considered to be a man of right and left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left.
It doesn't matter to me whether a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is we're moving forward.
I don't care if someone's right or left, I want to join people.
I have always openly supported any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from KSČM or ODS and, in the same way, I will be against bad ideas.
It's funny when it's said that you're a populist.
But isn't he proving it with what he says?
When a business plan is created for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get close to them.
There will be people who call it populism, but all the proposals I'm speaking already work in the world or known experts talk about them.
But without Parliament's support, it is only granted.
And that can't survive long-term politics.
Or do you believe that if you address and talk to people, you will gain, for example, a criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no choice.
To convince politicians, journalists and civil society and to try to get them out of my way.
If he had been elected President, there would be no problem in organizing a direct television transmission in which he would ask the leaders of parliamentarian parties to legislate criminal and financial responsibility for state politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And, possibly, they should communicate why they don't want to.
If there is a strong character that indicates disputes, pressure can be made on the political scene.
Let us take the President's direct election, which has been a success of public pressure.
At the same time, I say I'm just a fan, not a genius or an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I'm trying to find allies.
I just started politics and tried to get the most possible support for my programme.
I'm trying to get things out of hand myself, but if it doesn't work out well, I'll leave it within six years and return to the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura was saving the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know that with a person I'm doing nothing, so I've visited a number of well-known personalities, so they'll best be encouraged to present their application to the Senate.
I saw Radim Jancura, but he refused because he had a lot of work to do.
For my part, I have at least supported research journalist Jana Lorencová, who has shed light on the frauds with light heating oil.
I presented myself from the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm in the balance.
The 60 percent of the population did not attend the meetings and those who did so voted in favour of the institution.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
People have chosen the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct choice of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own game?
I haven't considered it yet because I don't have time for it, to check the infamous past of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money.
I don't have any money for the presidential campaign, there's only 20,000 crowns in my transparent account.
You don't have money?
It's about property declarations, how's yours?
I love my private property in about 60 million.
In Prague I have a estimated land of 25 million, a valued area of 10 million, another estimated area of eight million, a collection of works of art with a value of ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Superb Scoda valued in a million, and in the account I have a couple of millions.
Of course, I have an Aston Martin because it was my youth dream. I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was fun with women and, at the same time, fought evils and injustices.
Drive an Aston Martin, his property is valued at 60 million and does not have money for the campaign?
You say he wants to change the Republic but does not want to put too much money on his part.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to blame myself?
In the campaign I've already put 2.5 million.
The fact that there are no sponsors shows that there is not too much interest in my program.
And I don't have the obligation to pay the campaign with my wallet money.
The costs of the campaign are essentially covered by what I will receive in terms of senator's salary.
But I couldn't live with it, for example, I couldn't pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 monthly crowns.
If I only wanted to earn money, then I wouldn't be presented as a candidate.
So he'll continue with his business to live?
Didn't he say before he left this activity?
This has nothing to do with a bigger salary.
As I have promised, I have left some of my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will be my replacement in spring.
People wanted me to be the Samaritan to save the Republic.
But I also need to live with something.
How much does it take to earn monthly as a entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, I'm still winning.
If he was president, then he would leave the business.

The MVRDV architecture study shows that real adventures are not just in the head - in the example of Spijkenisse library and the recently completed "book set" - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it has a futureist look, and finally there's something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a transcontinent passing through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, a IT technician in a large company located near the library, points out: "In addition, the building is beautiful".
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have Internet, tablets and e-books.
No one gets into those old fashion libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleepy city located at the gates of Rotterdam that only deserves a visit, bears in mind the doubt of being raised with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 people represents the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this embarrassing situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven fictional points that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of decorated armoured horming.
The success of the educational offender was limited.
And that was how political leaders decided that there was only one possibility to improve statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, of the Dutch architecture study MVRDV, all a teacher in the art of bar charts and responsible for buildings fun at the pair of cynics, took the subject with his usual seriousness and compared the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury looked around him and embraced him, Maas proceeded to pick up the books by size in a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear lovers:
Here you have it, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, called 'Boekenberg'.
Nine years later, the amount of EUR 30 million rose to the planned location.
This form is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with underground parking, supermarket, mail office and a couple of housing and suitable buildings.
In early November, the book mount was awarded with the second award "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also named after the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
In this way, the small town of history, which up to date had nothing more than to offer than a post-modern Petonal area and an incredible addition made after which white-faced white one would rather be a center of milk, now has a contemporary architecture work.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is that it's a book paradise under a casserole.
It's true that there's an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountain mackerel, but the true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but they prefer to base themselves with their topography at every step of their climb to the top.
The fully acrystalized interior is bright and easy to cover with the view, the ground of the collected ladrill and elegant words support the public condition of the library in an undisclosed way.
The urban environment is perfect.
When you save the view, you can come to see the park banks, dogs and children and girls playing football.
And for all sides books, books and more books.
"Normally book stanzas are available along the street and in the center a huge dark room is opened which, generally, is often something uncomfortable and personal," says Winy Maas.
What we've done is put shoes up the classic space configuration and get the reading area inside the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: the offices, the Internet library, the aedres club, the environmental education centre and the maintenance room are located in the center.
Special mention deserves the black stanzas that assume the functions of wall coverings, parapets and varandillas at the same time.
The view, the tattoo and the olfactory are strange.
Even the architects and civil engineers most of the day shake their heads when they hear of this unknown material.
"We would like to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.
And so it is like one day, in a fresh agricultural holding, we meet with the appropriate subproduct from agriculture.
For many years, in the winters and in the lowlands of the Netherlands, plastic fabric is used as a basis for the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fabric lasts for two stations and then fades.
For the library, this tissue was first taken in such quantities until it reached a square inch [4 cm] of thickness.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and turns into a dark, homogenous and resistant material that smells a new car mix and sports shoes.
After 105 injuries, they arrive at the top of the mountain.
At the end of this road, almost 500 meters around the mountain waits for the reward: from the café there is not only a fantastic view of the city, but it can also enjoy beautiful Dutch crochets and its fig trees planted in huge machetes.
These create a pleasant environment for the pair that maintain adequate atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Grants for a new soul
"Although it costs you to believe in data on its vast acrystal surfaces, this building is an example project in respect of ecology," Trouborst points out.
The necessary heating and cooling is obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge crystal pyramid, even in the most sunny days the sun shines only for a few hours inside it.
The huge wooden beams that are located across the glass façade serve to provide shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable internal climate.
The rest is something of the automatic Persians.
Stefan Spermon, the scenic worker of the Information Technologies sector, has already been forced to put foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has been there too.
Similarly, Chinese traditional medicine professor Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She qualifies the "Boekenberg" as Spijkenisse's "relative soul".
The reason is that, due to the inauguralization that took place a few weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to give a book from their private collection.
In this way it is intended to fill the optical eggs of a library that still does not have its complete file; it currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept's gone crazy.
The stations are filled.
"There's nothing worse than an empty medium library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain connection to this building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the library.
Even though he's just there to dress.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved all success in that queen discipline that in the specialized argot is known as "creating an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of the young man and inculcat that can be.
Finally, a point of departure to conform to your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more protagonist role"
Germany has abstained from the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in U.S.-Europe relations, this is located in Berlin in a very dangerous diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany understood that it would vote against the proposal to grant the status of the observer State of the United Nations to the Palestinian territories.
However, Berlin finally withdrew.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, due to the special relationship between the country and Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I don't think it supports North American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical with Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also withdrew when it was about to establish a flight ban zone.
This has been finally declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear position when important international themes are being played?
Yeah, that's right.
This is due to the fact that it is currently refocusing its foreign policy, avoiding a leading policy, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what is more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans are therefore found in an intrusion.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to doing so.
I think they're still trying to figure out what their role will be, but they've already started the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries such as France or Great Britain.
What is the meaning of a "normal" external policy from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions other than those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is strongly motivated by economic policy, i.e. in exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are quite different from those of other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position adopted with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the United Nations vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason, it should be careful not to deviate from the Arab public opinion or from the Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I wouldn't give you so much importance because it's not a totally unilateral relationship.
However, they play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany lost its relationship with the United States by refusing to vote in important decisions such as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, German position is a great deal of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a drastic cut in Libya as in Libya.
Maybe Germany has managed to grow a certain respect.
In the end and in the end, all of this has done but demonstrated that it is a country that is seriously taken into account as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
Instead, the U.S. has clearly shown itself in favour of a veto.
Are there discrepancies between the United States and many European nations?
These discrepancies have always existed due to the US internal policy.
I believe that the Obama government is secretly showing a great understanding of the European position.
However, because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot defend that position in public.
I believe that the true discrepancy of opinions does not really have the confusion that is attributed to it.
If we analyze the relations between Obama and Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not for anything excited about the policy it develops.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile the close relations between Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for Germans if there were a coherent and homogenous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the ability to form part of a superior entity, but they must move things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that Germany will play a leading role in the future in order to force Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, but simply for the relationship it maintains with Israel.
This has always been a dangerous topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of independent figure.
Do you see Germany itself in the role of an important international actor? Do you really want Germany to assume a protagonist role?
Or maybe he's still making it hard to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet been accustomed to it, it is always a bit uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it continues to play a more important role in the country.
If we observe the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany puts itself as a major actor, certain anti-German feelings are dismissed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem, and no one wants to be around the enemy countries.
In this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a responsive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The US's influence on European policy is increasingly declining, but the EU is not currently covering this void, so who is there?
The Germans will not be given more medicine than to assume a more protagonist role.
Even if they don't like it, if it makes them uncomfortable or if it turns them into even more impotuous people, it's life!

"Protect Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly converted into Chinese brands
Armani is a brand known worldwide and Polo Ralph Lauren too.
But what is Armani Polo?
After this name a name officially registered in China is hidden but has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, this pleasure of protection while the true eponyms do not make a claim.
And even then it's not clear that you're going to give them the reason.
"To foreigners it is becoming increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of the buffer Taylor Wessing specialized in violations of protection rights in the Middle East.
A new case comes to my table every week.
Imitators simply add a few letters to record their brands.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada is registered Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way as did Puma sports goods manufacturer.
Pattloch opens an archiver in which he keeps seats from the Beijing brand office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company requested to register the Zegna DF Puma brand, an artificial name that also served as the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That Chinese are global champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are large warehouses of several plants devoted exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are of another nature. For its clients, he is fighting against the fact that the trade mark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to obtain a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
Which refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It's harmful to business, you have to fight it," asks Pattloch.
"The mark makes water, the monopolistic position disappears, and the damage to the image is enormous."
The financial losses and the procedural costs of the affected sectors are millions, especially in the case of luxury emblematic products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year in China, the third market for luxury products is in size and is growing at a higher rate.
However, to achieve the cancellation of registrations of questionable legality in the trademark register is complicated and also much money.
The processes can be extended up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases where the court rejected a claim because it had been through so long as the object name of the claim had already become a "market reality".
"If the applicant has a bad luck, maybe even he has to pay money to the plaintiff because the process has damaged his brand in China," Pattloch points out.
This is sometimes the law of the forest.
Some of the most known cases have to be seen with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a fight against the manufacturer of Sany construction machinery, the company that had been absorbed recently by the German bomber Putzmeister.
Therefore today, Chinese can continue to use a very similar symbol to Mercedes's star.
Volvo's buyer, Geely, used a white and blue logo at first, which reminded BMW of a great deal; the case was referred to the courts, and Geely had to change it.
The clothing manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitations from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a cocodron looking at the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO Mark Office in Beijing acknowledges that there have been difficulties in 2010 due to lack of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the labour emergency situation returned to normal".
In this way, the number of untreated complaints has been reduced by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain pending for resolution.
Working against this cost a lot of money
As usual in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost one third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and meant that China would lead the list of new registrations worldwide for ten consecutive years, as indicated by the brand office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, a figure that rises to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1,800 million yuan would have been charged in the form of rights.
In other words, this means that, on average, each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euro.
Working against this costs a lot of money, as shown by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the group has fought in the courts against a Chinese imitator.
Although the Germans have been able to stop the illicit manufacture of imitation car parts,
the sampler has succeeded in ensuring Chinese rights on the Freudenberg mark.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany the appellants are not protected," said Hanno Wentzler, President and Member of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trade mark office also condemned the use of municipalities.
In the following two instances, Freudenberg has been justified, but the opposite is still fighting.
You have to be very careful.
The case has now reached the gates of the Supreme Court of Justice, where the resolution is still pending.
Wentzler is confident that he will be able to resolve the matter in favour and commend the professionality of the courts.
However, he also claims that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time".
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business file has had to review expeditions from up to a hundred years of age to be able to prove.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the party a "six-digit sum in euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but it failed.
"This shows how much we care about it," says Wentzler.
The risks posed in the Middle East even threaten to affect Europe,
in particular if imitations are guaranteed there rights on unprotected trademarks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
Some time ago the group left this commercial area, however it was able to prevent registration.
"You have to be very careful," Wentzler says.
Both he and Pattloch counsel recommend that German companies be very careful at business time with China.
It is not enough to rely on international law on trademark rights, but what must be done is "to record in China all that can be protected", as Wentzler points out.
On the contrary, the theme can be much more expensive than a simple record.
In fact, if Freudenberg would lose the last strike of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposite party license rights on his own behalf, as Wentzler explains.
That or the segment in question would get us out of the market.
World Day of the Fight against AIDS: dancing, singing, helping
Heidelberg is testing the heart of Impogi and in Swaziland the victims of AIDS are happy
The history of a link can exceed much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First it starts with the ball: cotton boots, ballast shoes, taco shoes and mocasins are looking for the compass on the ground of the park, and they quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Only then begin to slowly raise the voices of the singers (control, bottom, tenor and soprano), reminiscent of themselves, confused and followed by each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get almost out of his house by trying to order with his energy and soft gestures.
It's Monday afternoon and in the music room of Heidelberg's Medical Institute of Psychology, Impogi's heart is trying a new song.
Fifty singers have also arrived from 23 to 69 years of age from the human geneticist to the master of the house.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a known foreign language: the Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to a UNAIDS estimate, the United Nations AIDS Programme worldwide is approximately 34 million people infected with HIV.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 per cent of the population is already seropositive.
The Association Voices for Africa has found fathers in Germany for 180 HIV orphans from the people of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend secondary school.
EUR 15 or 20 per month can be given to a child.
This contribution will cover the school matrix, the uniform, and ensure a hot food every day at the Gogo Center.
Imbuntui means in blue "historic" or "panegirist".
In this room no one can speak with fluidy tongue, but sing yourself they know.
For ten years this choir has tried songs in this mild foreign language that is sometimes able to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
At 8,733 kilometres straight from Heidelberg, in the northeastern part of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a people called Esitjeni who depend on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent is infected
About 2,000 people live there, some even in simple bars and bars, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have been infected with AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the higher AIDS infection rate and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to Unicef.
The population does not see the circulation with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection to half.
More than 40 per cent of the inhabitants of Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying with something over thirty years has become common.
During a joint trip to Africa in spring 2005, the heart discovered this well-known population, but what they saw above all were many children in the streets that lacked not only the protection of their parents, but mainly food, clothing and training.
Without a school title, opportunities in a poor country are more expensive.
In principle, it was only the special commitment of a few things that made it possible for a child to go out of college and enjoy a hot meal every day.
A year later, however, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa" association that has since been professionally employed by AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial ETS are syphilis, clamide and gonorrhea.
ETS of the most common viral origin are AIDS, human papillam virus, genetic herpes or hepatitis.
The leaves and sand are found between the ETS transmitted by parasites.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are more frequent in men who maintain sexual relations with other men.
Robert Koch is part of the basis that at least four of the five cases of syphilis recorded in Germany have their origin in sexual contact with men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are clamide, tricommones, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (hong) and gonorrhea.
The incidence of HIV among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections are recorded in this group.
Among young people,clamide infections are much more common than in other groups of the population.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1.697 cases in 2001 to 3.698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has remained a downward trend since 2007.
In 2011, approximately 2,700 cases were recorded.
It is a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that this is a venous disease?
Infectious diseases may cause ulcers in the genital area, urinary disorders, flu, abdominal pain, as well as ampoules or urticaria.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore do not detect them.
How can one protect?
Conservatives may reduce the risk of contamination, but do not offer protection to a hundred per cent.
Some pathogenic agents of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through susceptibility and physical contact infections.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if they change with frequent sexual intercourse.
If they are temporarily diagnosed, the majority of ETS can be cured and it is possible to avoid any delayed consequences.
Through collaborations, donations and, ultimately but not least important, of the honours that cover the heart for their actions throughout Germany, they are able to earn a lot of money.
"In total we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a safe woman herself and with leadership powers manages the money sent from Germany.
It is concerned that the orphans find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogogos", as it is called the older women in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their charge, offer them a roof where they live, and care that children go to school every day in a moment and dress with their uniforms.
Those who have no one remain under Khanyyle's protection, a single woman who, like the two cooks who are responsible for cooking every day for more than 200 pregnant children, realizes a pay from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has launched a coastal school, has built two galleries, and, in collaboration with the U.S. health organization PSI, has achieved that many of the people have been subjected to a HIV test.
This is not obvious, because, despite the patent that this disease is in the whole country, it is not often mentioned openly about it.
A king with 14 wives
"The AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because she has to deal with sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king has officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and full life-style.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This form of life not officially accepted is largely responsible for the rapid spread that has experienced HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless temporary ones who travel across the country from one side to the other and take it to where they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner you can get free condoms, but these are only used.
It's another culture, here they only accept contact with skin against skin."
To promote cultural exchange, Impopi Coro travels every two or three years south of Africa by singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost part of the African continent still remember from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; both recognition not only brings me a great environment and much joy, but it has also managed to get you some tears to someone other than the Arab border soldier.
The journey always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the children who are deprived.
Although this small population appears only on the maps, in the valley of the Ezullo River is well known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there shines light," the local people say.
And after passing the 8,733 kilometres straight back to Heidelberg to the test rooms on the Bergheimer street filled with singers marking the step, one is aware that it is also possible to see their light shine from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice in Mercurio
The Messener probe has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercurio.
The ice layer probably has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the North American Space Agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercurio.
Despite being treated from the nearest planet to the sun, there is also hot water, as it is learned from three studies published on Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that a layer of ice has been formed in the area of the planet that is permanently located in the shadow.
It seems that it has at least 30 cm and probably up to 20 meters thick.
The water is probably made up of comets or, most likely, of asteroids that were in their day shouting against Mercurio.
No one refers to the finding of ice with the possibility of life on the planet, says the researcher chief of the Messener probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercurio can reach up to 426 degrees Fahrenheit.
However, findings could help explain how water and other components of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Fully unwarranted for the inhabitants of the planet Earth, the probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are devoted to exploring the depths of the universe.

This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family picture" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars appear as blue points, although the most difficult to recognize is the red color of the "born stars".
This region of star formation, known as a little romantically by scientists W5, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the Caspian constellation, at a distance of 6,500 light years.

Depending on the tone, some images of spiral galaxies become real works of art.
The image published by the Australian European Observatory shows the Trifida Nebula located thousands of years of light in the Sagitario constellation.
The name Trifida is derived from the Latin term "trifidus" (trifidus divided into three), since some dark lines of dust divide the heart moving from this area of star formation into three lobulas.
In the setting of Ofiuc, astronomers could photograph the indications of a cosmic carcarcarcar: 400 million years light from Earth, the nucleus of two galaxies in the process of fusion is slowing down one another to end shocking in an irremediable manner.

Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it with the name Molinillo Australian.
The photograph of the Hubble space telescope shows a section of the Nebula Iris in the Cefeo constellation.
The nebula located at 1,400 years of light is composed of dust particles whose size is between 10 and 100 times smaller than that of dust particles that we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and radiographs made by different telescopes.

In this nebulas there is the group of the most brilliant young stars of our Milky Way.
This star formation area constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Roseta Nebula, there are also constantly new stars; 5,000 years of Earth's light.
In this brilliant galaxy with a small black hole there is still no dust, just gas.
Researchers suggest that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe it could be found above all hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it one year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes has not stopped growing, and the images that they offer us are increasingly deep.
For 30 years, especially from 1947 to 1975, the telescope Hale located in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the picture, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Big Binocular Telescope is rising.
This allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Grand Telescope Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The South African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of approximately 11 meters.
The unconventional nature of this more economic construction is that the telescope has a fixed height angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Tejas also has a fixed height angle.
Its particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light.
Despite having a relatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is equivalent to the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the Arecibo radiotelescope (Port Rico), researchers can explore the universe in search of signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Extraterrestrial Intelligence Search" (SETI for its signals in English) can help any person who owns a computer, contributing to processing capacity.

Here comes the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also receive the so-called E-ELT (European Extreme Large Telescope or European Extreme Large Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 metres and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Up to 2018 no images are expected to be taken.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located in the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, together with them, explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of huge proportions and with a diameter of 30 meters.
This is a picture of how it would be.
However, the most important information of the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has sent pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for extrasolated planets, especially those that are inhabited.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that since the beginning of its mission 1,235 candidates have been located on planets.
The image shows the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The telescope James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched on board an Ariane 5 to 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
Researchers are based on the fact that there is also ice in the South Pole of Mercurio.
However, there are no compelling evidence, since the messageer probe rotates around the planet in a much closer orbit to the north.
For decades, radiation measurements have focused on the existence of ice in Mercurio.
Thanks to the messageer (2004) probe, the first orbit around Mercurio, scientists are now sure that it is.

A search for needles in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The route by the mountainous region of Talysh could be regarded as safe and romantic.
The minibus makes great progress through the sinuous road that passes along the forest mountains, rivers of great quality and the simple houses of local farmers.
It's all green and juicy, one might even think it's in the Black Sea.
However, we are located in the southernmost area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometres.
Here live the "talyshi" people who are not very well known, except that they perfectly dominate the Persian and the Assyrian and that they are very distant.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town assumes a architecture perhaps too masculinally designed in the Soviet era and that it does not seem to fit everything in such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists only arrive here because the road from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometres that separate both urban cores, it takes eight hours because the road is of one sense.
The amazing wealth of which the country enjoys thanks to the oil of the Caspio Sea has not yet reached this region.
However, Pilateta Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what needs to be turned into a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May because of the celebration of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world," notes Fatulayeva.
This is the director of the Longevity Museum, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here the life of eight dozen Thais is documented from the place they have been over 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points to an image in white and black.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
A son died at the age of 136
However, the indisputable star of the museum is the shepherd of sheep Şirali Müslümov, who appears to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And if we consider that the documented older man lived 122 years, it seems that Muslimov's age is quite suspicious.
"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married on three occasions and had 23 children, and it seems that he still had time to conceive a daughter at 136 years of age.
So has Şirali Muslimov been mistaken in his age for a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute of Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this Central Asian population.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan, there are also very advanced elderly people," Scholz says, "including in Cerdena there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence on age; at least when there is no civil record.
Every day empty filled with detachable butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly, residents of the region around Lerik often reach a Bible age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do so many older people live here in the south?
The tourist guide, Farid Mugimzadeh, explains that it is the special species of Thais.
The director of the museum, Mrs Fatulayeva, believes that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the rich food in the calories of the tachyshi, which worship the meat, bread and, above all, the dairy products and many of which drink a batch of dried butter daily, be so healthy.
Or maybe it's the natural way of life that keeps young people? In Chengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik live Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years of age, he is relatively young to what he is used to.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple typical wooden house throughout the Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, it moves incansibly a huge amount of butter.
Eight people live under a roof, one of them children and one of Mirzayeva's daughter, both became grandparents some time ago.
They also play on one side to the other two small children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for guests, a tea that serves in typical dishes in a bombed way.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and are perfectly aligned and under the thumb hide two long pieces of dark ruby hair that his son discovers us proud.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so I've never fallen down and kept his color.
"I've never used a shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced in his own garden: tomatoes, potatoes and chisantes.
I've never been shopping for a supermarket all my life.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the postwar period of World War II.
However, everything came back to its fall when the "queen father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This type of propaganda sounds strange in the mouth of an older woman.
In Azerbaijan, however, the religion taught in the parental form of the nation, which runs its country as a dictator, does not know limits.
It remained in power until 2003, the moment the witness handed to his son Ilham.
At least Azerbaijan's biggest people don't know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva covers 230 manats (about the same amount in euros) in terms of monthly pension, a quantity with which you can live well taking into account the situation here.
And maybe Mirzayeva's son-in-law is right: "In our culture the adults are very respected."
They live in a large family, they are loved, they receive all the care they need and they are happy.
As if this wasn't enough reason to keep yourself alive for many years...
In the Constitution, the expression "Human Rights" is missing
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The huge division in which the country is raised is demonstrated by the manifestations of the manifestations of each other's rivalism in Cairo.
The future constitution, with the share as a basis, is very controversial.
The Egyptian president did not exaggerate in patentism.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on public television.
His speech was directed to all the people, especially to Christian concepts, liberals, illustrated Muslims and secularists.
All of them, who have submitted without remedy to this day in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the shores of the Nile through the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, in an almost forgiving way, he has had to temporarily abandon the competences of the Constitutional Court and expand his "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither Egypt nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer, with a doctor's title given by the University of South California, really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive yourself of your power in court?
In fact, the 234 articles, which have been approved by an assembly consisting of 100 predominantly Islamic members at a 15-hour night meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, it is also said that the judiciary is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
However, what does that mean of "principles"?
This was and continues to be open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists are going to take advantage of this false formulation, as well as the margin of legal manoeuvre that has appeared, to impose a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
This is at least one new article suggested: in all matters relating to sharia it is mandatory to consult the University of Al-Ashar, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power throughout the Sunny Islam.
It does not have any reason to be so, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that would, in fact, have resulted in the inadmissibility of the judiciary.
Most of the deletion of the constitution is open to interpretation
The problem is also that they intend to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship, these courts served to exercise severe repression over the opposition.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the deletion states, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its moral and values".
It is such a vague formulation in legal terms that, with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Clearly speaking is nothing but censorship.
Because no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
Instead, he is prohibited from offending or slandering Prophet Mohammed and his allies.
However, it is not clear what an offense is and how it must be punished.
The same doubt is the formulation that prohibits "people's offense"
Is it enough for the president's card or a check on a letter?
The question of interpretation, such as many other things in the trashor that have been presented to Mursi for her signature, and that, according to her words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be subjected to referendum.
"The revolution has come back."
Weeks ago the opposition was closing lines against the superiority of Islamists.
Ten thousand people met in an unusual harmony on Friday afternoon at the Tahrir Square in Cario and swore to fail the Act before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will end up winning," Hamdin Sabbahi says, who holds the third place on the list of presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace and director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the founder of the constitution should be "in the dust of history".
Through Twitter he accused Mursi's followers of wanting to lead a "state fight against democracy".
"When you call the referendum we'll go to your palace and we'll drop it," said oppositioner Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been shed," was quoted in the Egyptian media to political oppositioner Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, so they would not be considered valid.
"The Qur'an is our constitution."
On the other hand, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-manifestion; if so, not at Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, before the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and lashes took part in the same cry: "The people demand the application of the divine law."
They demanded Mursi to "clean the country" at the same time as they proclaimed, "The Qur'an is our constitution".
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic square Tahrir, where everything began, would have caused a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, Mursi's supporters did not want to risk anything like that.
The Muslim brothers said that both those who oppose the author of the constitution and the party members of the same would have expressed their views high and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide which direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the Islamic wiper has guaranteed the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' does not even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this forced constitutional process that should in fact have lasted until February and have included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison or had to face a trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shares his ideology, but because for him human rights are indisputable.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression 'Human Rights' does not even appear in the new constitution," laments a conversation with the newspaper "Well am Sontag".
The extension of Mursi's competences to the State's three powers led to the re-signation of this lawyer.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the President has done is abolishing it," Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot operate without civil society organizations.
He felt abandoned, too by the international community, which observed the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protester at Tahrir Square warns: "You're thinking of a monster you can't control."
The Norwegian rakfisk: the world's most ruthless fishing?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the largest levels of life, not just Europe but the world.
Is it possible that the country's success would have anything to do with its awareness of a highly vulnerable fishing?
Take a series of overcrowded cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty and wet football.
He left it there for a week.
You will then be able to smell the aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway's quays.
I'm meeting in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
The rakfisk is called in a saloon that is left closed in water for a year, depending on the bad guy you prefer, for a year.
As it gets darker and it gets colder, the Norwegians are too proud to celebrate a festival here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this food of the most, so to say, causative.
"It eats raw and then drinks a glass of water from a trail," says Havard Halvarsen, a bomber of the city that is also known as the "General of Rakfisk", who is responsible for organizing the festival.
On all sides we see people eating this fish that is stored in small cubes and drinking a large amount of wine.
"Some people like water more than rakfisk," Havard says.
Drink can kill the smell.
I'm trying some shoes.
If you can prevent it from passing near the nose, it's not bad; it's not very different from a part of sushi that has walked a few kilometers in the bus.
The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, in which the poor people in Norway had abstinence, and in which, before there was freezing, the fish was kept during the autumn in water and salt in hermetical barrels.
Later, in full winter, when it is well fermented, it is removed and, of course, with negative feelings due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and they mostly emigrated to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A stream of residents of Sweden, the old rival and even not far more rich than Norway, comes to this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be something important, an essential part, although quite illusory, of the past of Norway.
It is found among the most expensive dishes that can be bought.
But, actually, it's all expensive. A beer cane or a sandwich cost you 10 € ($14) each.
Norway does not often appear on the agenda of international news and most Norwegians like it.
Here people are still reluctant to pronounce the name Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the event of 22 July".
To the Norwegians it is very costly to believe that one of their beloved countries would be able to commit such cruelty and murder.
After much of the current wealth of Norway, there has been growth, since the early 70s, of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason we're doing so well," says Anna, our roommate, as it goes through gangs of rakfisk and that, with its long red and surprising blue eyes, represents the image of the Norwegian wellness.
"We are, as you said, smart people."
His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to wake up, we don't like hostages."
Norway has managed its oil wealth with a lot of caution; however, except for a small percentage of the money from this industry, it invests in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While the whole world was wasting money that it did not have during the years leading up to the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the ticket close.
"As long as we can fly in winter and make sandwiches in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," adds with a loaded developer.
I'm in the snow doing with her to eat something; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now a hamburger of alce is certainly something different and quite succulent than taste.
But in the night, he's back that bad fish.
The hotel in which I live is one of the many locals where a rakfisk dinner is held in which the communists vote for the best fish, or perhaps the most test of the natural beings.
A television has been connected directly to a representative who is wearing pajarita and is surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It looks like Eurovision's competition.
"What are your score for the best fish up there on the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There are smiles and applause.
A man falls from the chair, maybe conquered by the aquavit.
Or maybe they're the steams of all that fishing.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a hard start
While the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, is preparing to take over his position, BBC correspondent Will Grant, analyzes the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at present.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already congested, a steel circle has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads leading to the city and is causing huge falls on the roads.
The objective, however, was not to prevent workers from arriving at their place of work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and assume the management of the nation.
He's faced with a complicated task.
Mexico has been achieving good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is experiencing a war against drug trafficking that has taken some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My Government has a great commitment with the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Peña Nieto explained early this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, at the Oval Space.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal."
Before signing with the President of the United States, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was the governor of his native state, Mexico.
A very popular state and with rapid growth, which surrounds the capital; Opinions on the new leader are divided into this territory where he used to move.
A sincere man
In Valle del Bravo, for example, it is remembered with affection in the bucólic city of Valle del Bravo.
Its residents assign it to the merit of the growth of tourism in the area and of infrastructure construction.
In order to reach the city, one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads can be driven, which is a huge improvement compared to the roads planted and filled with bags that were rehabilitated.
You can also see cards with your name at the entrance of a modern multi-port and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We are confident that he can make a real and lasting change," said his political friend Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a member of the party of Mr. Peña Nieto, the PRI.
"In particular, with regard to security and the economy, we expect the interesting and true change that our country so much needs."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was debanked by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Mr Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the Los Pinos Presidential Palace, there are many expectations in the party regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
He also rejected the qualification that opposition makes of the new president's lack of essence.
"He is a very sincere, very committed man and with a wonderful vision of the country.
He's a fantastic state man and above all, he's a person who can hear."
However, on the other hand, that state is not the impression that many people have on their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as the City of Neza, the contrast with the crowded streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under high-ranking autopistas is, in many ways, a surprise of Mexico City's own.
And the city's problems are also difficult and urban.
Early this year, military intervention was requested to assist in the fight against drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a desert parcel, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of twelve murdered women have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than the Juárez City, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is a synonym for the murder of innocent women.
Mr. Peña Nieto's critics say, in the best case, that I did not intend to address the problem of feminicide while I was in charge.
The most critical of them accuse their administration of making the view fat.
In a home of hormigon, typical of the damaged neighborhood, Irenea Budendía has to make efforts to contain tears while showing photos of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana was murdered in 2010.
However, her family believes that her husband killed her.
"When I got to her house, it seemed like they had cleaned her body," recalls Mrs. Buendía.
"There were signs that he had been beaten and the cruel death had already appeared."
While his mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana observes from the walls, along with a cross in which a single word is read: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says has been denied.
"The authorities of the state have treated me as if it were an old charismatic, an abbot, a complainant.
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and that it is hidden."
"But that can't be when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence," he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new President has promised to give them priority during his mandate.
"I hope it's the same kind of president who was when he was governor," said the MP of PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of the City of Niza fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain of ill-treatment, according to the tax authorities
The prosecutors are trying to deal with Bradley Manning's allegations of abuse during his stay in prison
The trial is based on the Manning period in Quantico military prison in Virginia.
The defence wants the case to be dismissed on the basis of which Manning's imprisonment was severe.
The army army is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to prove the Friday that military soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the greatest clandestine filtering of information in the history of the United States, lost many opportunities to denounce the ill-treatment that he now alleged suffered while under military arrest.
During the inquiry that the prosecutor made to Manning in a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein stated that the records of the weekly visits of the unit's official visits received by Manning during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia show no complaints about the treatment he received.
The questionnaire, which was carried out during a view carried out on the basis of the request for defence that the case was dismissed because its imprisonment had been severe and that it had already meant enough punishment, came one day after Manning had testified that he had intended to be murdered while he was detained.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
In the spring, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officials completed after their visits to Manning during his arrest in the military prison in Quantico, where he was imprisoned in a maximum detention regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officials would have asked Manning questions and noted their answers.
When Friday Fein asked about the forms, Manning recognized that he had qualified for the treatment given to his cell mates as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, although officials asked Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers who visited him had talked about those problems and had indicated that they would be dealt with, but that they did not leave such issues in the register.
"They wrote 'no incidents' (after I talked about the problems) but this does not necessarily mean that I had not mentioned any problem," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel of the Denise Lind Army, also asked Manning why he had not reported the treatment he had received during the meeting held in January 2011 with a council to consider the suicide intentions he had expressed in a form a month earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "union prevention" regime under which it was found.
The military said that they had placed it under that restrictive regime, which was under surveillance for possible suicide, in order to ensure their protection and security of other persons.
"I wanted the bigger state to know that I was good and (I) wanted to stop being vulnerable... in order to enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning witnessed Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before being transferred to the military prison based on the seabed in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he lost his knowledge due to heat.
He said that the fact that he wouldn't be allowed to know what was happening to him or what was going on in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was so reduced to the Arafjon Camp, to that yellow," Manning explained on Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that hole."
Manning stated that, once transferred to Quantico, he spent most of the days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a coat, a coat, some shoes, some clothes and his gloves.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, since he was forbidden to sleep or even to sleep during the day.
Manning said he always had a light coming out by pointing out his eyes while he was asleep.
He said that if the guards could not see his face when he returned in the night, they would wake him up so he could come back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint in January 2011 on the treatment received by Manning.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made in the Thursday statement, which, after being forced to sleep out in his Quantico cell, he was obliged during a morning's account to stay out of his foot in front of the guards and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the coat during the account.
During the trial of the judge on Friday, Manning said that I gave him the order he gave to the celler that he should let down the coat with which he could have been covered, but he recognized that no one had ordered him to let it fall.
Manning testified that he had been forced to sleep the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he did not pose a threat to himself.
Manning stated that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastics of his inner garment or his boots to autolet himself but that he had not done so.
Manning testified that that night they had withdrawn from their cell their inner garments, their shoes and their gloves.
Their lawyers hope that the judge will take into account at least the experiences he has experienced during his stay in prison and will dramatically reduce his sentence if he has been convicted in the war council, which is expected to begin at the beginning of the coming year.
The defence stated that it was intended to make Manning guilty of minor crimes and to defend other charges considered too extreme.
The view is expected to be resumed this weekend and it is expected that the prosecutors argue that the conditions of the detention were justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was detained in accordance with the application standards to any detained person found under maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, unlawfully promoting the publication of information on the Internet, filtering information from the national defence and theft of property or public records.
If it is declared guilty of all charges, it could be faced with a chain forever.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He claims that many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who went away; they say they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarret notes that Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just been down by the explosion and arrived at the immigration processing area and was already completely confused.
Some maps indicated the road to two trains: one for "Mexico" and the other for "Externals".
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where I should go.
When I grew up in Central California, I've been called "Mexicon" all my life.
It is ethnic taciography, in the same way that my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "irelandes" or my friends in New York are described as "Italian".
Later I decided by Mexican-American.
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather's home, the tachygraph or the guides weren't necessary.
It was just American.
I speak Spanish. It's good enough to handle me during an interview in this language.
But I don't have the level of a native vocabulary and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my passport to the United States and put me in the foreign college.
I thought this week when the elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always the leaders of these two countries met, he noted: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also seeking to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why it is now so likely that a Mexican stays in Mexico as an adventure to go to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trade block in North America in the style of the European Union.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue to fight drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and is full of regrets.
Most Americans are probably never aware that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to surrender half of their territory by gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that they remember are everywhere.
So, when a U.S. official says anything that makes Mexico the least critical, he begins to hear complaints, both in the press and between the Mexican elite, about how the United States is exercising the sovereignty of its neighbours.
And the children of Moctezuma stand in the foot of war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is that they have with more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about rehearsals?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it is not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point of our genetic tree, there was a person, maybe the father or mother or some of the grandparents, who had closed the door of opportunities in Mexico and had to go north.
And most of the time that person was trapped in a particular profile: dark skin, a level of studies below, from a poor people, etc.
We're his descendants, and we're loyal.
Not Mexico.
And, although we may be living now the American dream, having gone to good schools and had good work, we can never lose sight of what we are living in, that's the American dream, not the Mexican.
Sometimes our identity is not clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like them.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look at us above the shoulder as if we were from a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
As you can see, our existence is a synonym of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And now we wouldn't find ourselves trapped behind this silk court, living well in the United States but, still, as single souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally came to the United States when she was a child, reminds me that this rock exists between the Mexicans and the Mexican-Americans because the first know who they are and the second they are upset.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is part of the two countries.
In the meantime, many Mexican-Americans I know feel they're not part of either of them.
We like to listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres of the North, but also Bruce Springstein.
You have the best in each country, but you're not attracted to any of them.
In Mexico they see us as the United States.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to make things even more complicated, so I've been buried during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to connect again with the despair.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as "immigrants" of improvised Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our US partners the fantastic thing to visit that country and we would force political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much rehearsal.
And with the inequality of wages, glaucoma corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're gonna be alone with this idea, guys.
That's right.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they must accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still sensitive to the way their families were treated much less time ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battalion, new Middle East
The high fire between Israel and Hamas could well be a little unlikely basis for peace
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
Among the useless and usual discussions about who started first, a number of buildings have been reduced to ruins; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missions from Gaza have fallen close to Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem to be trapped in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left it all behind the taste or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been caught in the regional abbot.
Maybe this makes your fight even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to believe that their fatal death situation could be reversed.
A War That Never Fails or Wins
At first glance, optimism seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the fires agreed on 21 November were kept high, the challenges of this week have strengthened the Halcons of both bands.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will say that the Israelis have been forced to withdraw, although Gaza has received a good palace.
And despite having killed some of its leaders and put pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and inhabited settlements on earth, Israel has not been able to end with Hamas.
In fact, Hamás is gaining land in Cisjordania, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its imperceptible Fatah rivals, the more moderate Palestinian façade.
In addition, Hamas' leaders could come to the conclusion that time is playing in their favor.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamás has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a rebirth regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim alliance to Israel, has embraced Hamas' cause. It has also done so by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic states of the Gulf.
The excellent members of Hamas say that the Islamic moon is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hizbullah militia party dominates, passing through Syria, where the rebels of an increasingly Islamic trend could defeat Bashar Assad, until they reach Jordan, where Hamas' allies are threatening the king.
Above all in the southern part of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brothers led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, with the most popular and fundamental differences in Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the Laic defeat that ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have too much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brothers are Hamas' first brothers and their leaders depend more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamás may emerge as a protagonist to which even Israel and the United States cannot be excluded.
In the meantime, Israel's durable branch will draw the opposite conclusion.
With regard to the military issue, Hamás has been placed in his place.
The anti-misement system Capula de Hierro of Israel has demonstrated its effectiveness and many of Hamas' missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelites will sleep calmer for some time.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States is more firm than ever; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the last wave of violence.
Israel has made progress, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a first minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets fired from Gaza have ended with the lives of about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many murdered terrorists, in part due to the barrier that runs along the West Bank, the main part of an effort to become a Palestinian state, and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite the fact that, according to international law, they are illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Lukud party has joined a group of a more durable line led by Avigdor Lieberman in the pre-election period on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why do you blame those Palestinian retrospectors for giving them a state of their own?
If they were really ruling in Cisjordan, wouldn't they shoot cohets like this and how did they do their co-compatriots in Gaza?
It's better to have them behind that wall and give them a good shot if they raise their head.
It may be imposed on the durable needle, although the Arab spring could change its calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere lack appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defence budget is higher than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
Initiating a war with the sovereignty of the area will hardly help the new Arab Governments to improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the high fire is a good deal and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelites should also have thought for a long time.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, privatizing Palestinians of their right to self-determination implies creating a pool that one day will operate in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that a bus in Tel Aviv took place this week.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography is increasing the situation as the Arab population grows.
The cruel missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay a diplomatic debt every time.
Both gangs need a force of people who are involved in the conflict.
The solution continues to be the one who prays for people who are sensitive to both gangs, most of the outside world and this magazine: two states and the territory termination by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the height of the fire gives a little more impetus to the innocent people who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to flag the entry of weapons into Gaza, together with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas that it accepts the idea of a Jewish state based on the borders of 1967, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arab citizens should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would further contribute to the creation of a Palestinian State than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual status category in the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has an important role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he refused to submit his own plan for peace.
Again in the White House, it seems like a reindeer to devote her attention.
This attitude implies a grim vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This involves a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The generic tobacco packaging law enters into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases light on cajetillas of a greenished color, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, a pioneer in the world, enters into force and replaces the logos and colors of the brands by an envelope of an olive green faeces, amazing images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of children and babies we suffer from being children of smoking parents.
Except for the different health images and warnings, the only difference between cajetillas, compulsory since the Sabbath, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small type of source.
This is the strictest system of the world applied to the tobacco package.
The Australian federal government states that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking by eliminating the roots that make this habit glamour.
It trusts in studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that he will never.
"It can be seen that children, even from very early years, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls were related to the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the world's lowest smoking rates and these changes will not affect the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has been under tremendous pressure against the law.
The tobacco companies claimed that the law would promote the black tobacco market, in which cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious adverse consequences," said Scott McIntyre, of British American Tobacco, Australia.
It will increase the number of tobacco manufacturers in China and Indonesia to sell it on Australia's streets.
Others say that their business has benefited from the adoption of the law.
Sandra Ha, from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, claimed that the demand for pills and silicon covers to capture the unpleasant images of the cathetillas had been shot almost two months ago when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a refusal to the law in Australia's Supreme Court.
Ms. Ha said that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to major institutions and that he was expecting more.
"It's a good business for us."
According to experts, the potential obstacle is the popularity of social networks between the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
After a number of Australian laws prohibiting advertising on television and sports sports patronage, which force most sellers to avoid viewing cigarettes, tobacco marketing has been carried out online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local companies and websites, but cannot restrict it to foreign pages.
"If you sell tobacco and just leave this little window to promote your products, online space is the most convincing place to be," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University.
Freeman observed an increase in brand reviews of "foot citizens" published on social networking sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
It should be asked whether it is only a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has been troubled to make a video or if some marketing company is behind it all.
Australia's British American Tobacco indicated that industry is focusing more on the new legislation than on marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to reject the new standards; these countries are claiming to be the World Trade Organization that is restricting trade in unfairly, although none of these countries have a significant volume of trade with Australia.
It is likely that the WTO has adopted a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek stated that the Government had held talks with other countries considering applying similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001 Canada became the first country to introduce the obligation to include images in cajetillas.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, it is considered to be applying harder laws.
In Australia many smokers appear to be challenging.
"The photos don't affect me.
I just didn't happen to them."
"Take the cigarette and keep the package," says Victor El Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Surely, there's only one reason I'd quit smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the former King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, indicates that uniform cajetillas make it more difficult to place them in the stanzas.
"It was usually an hour late to discover a delivery; now it is four," Yu says.
"The government should have completely banned tobacco and then, it is, well, it's over and we close the store," he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to burn a little
During the days of Action Day this year, I suddenly had to spend five hours in an airport because the plane we were flying suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about frustration.
I'm not gonna lie to them.
To spend half a day in an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting us from duty-free stores.
But more and more academics and child development experts are praising the virtues of abortion.
According to them, it is good that, both us and our children, we drink once and for all.
Obsolescence is a requirement for the brain to find interesting options and may foster creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of frustration.
So, should we accept the abuse with a good heart?
Yeah.
And no.
But we'll talk about it later.
Firstly, as many people thought, now that we have more time for the oyster, abortion would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey says, the cathedral of Greek and Roman History of the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Livey History" ("The Abruction, an animated story") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not.
"In fact, the history of abortion is very extensive," he says.
In the walls of Pompey there are graffiti in Latin about the abuse that dates back to the first century C.E.
We also have to figure out how we define frustration.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many ways," says John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing the research published and putting the idea before a group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined frustration as the experience of "desiring, but unable to participate in a full-fledged activity".
He claims that the difference between abstinence and patia is that the person does nothing but wants to do it.
Please note that there is no desire to do anything with patia.
The main experience of frustration, he says, is "the modification of the attention process, associated with a low state of mind and a sense of slowness of time".
Abstinence can sound awfully like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that although they may be related, people who are depressed tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed think that the problem is theirs.
Sometimes we think we're disappointed, when what really happens to us is that we have problems to focus on.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Bored in Terms of Attention", published in September of the September edition of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to a previous experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading the article of a magazine.
Some groups listened in the room included a TV program for all volumes that did not keep any relationship, others listened to it with the volume below, so it was only obvious, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group who listened to the program with the volume below showed more frustration than the other two groups; it was necessary to concentrate on them, but they were not sure why and gave it to the abuse.
"When you try to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task, the shift of attention can lead to frustration," said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, such as detecting defective parts on a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not to burn you."
"In fact, we now know that moving or making garages, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of frustration, can actually help to fight it, because they make that person physically more alert."
"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to remain silent," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's about to burn at some point: the delay of a plane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly fat film.
But some people tend to be angry more than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed a "study approach" in the 1980s.
The scale includes issues such as "many of the things I have to do are repeated and monotonous" and "there are so many things I care I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of Psychology at West Florida University, says that, using these scales, researchers have found that boys tend to burn more often than girls, and especially need more external and varied incentives.
But, in general, adolescents are a type of group that is easily absorbed.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment involving 400 adolescents and their parents between seven and eight times a day by a search.
He discovered that 32 percent of adolescents said they would get drunk while they were in school or doing their duties, while 23 percent said they would get drunk when they were not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they would open up.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current abuse rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said that what he knew was that "adult is a period in which abortion reaches its highest rates", largely because both children and adolescents are not given great control over what they want to do.
So, going back to my question of the principle: is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, taking to extremes, it can cause us to expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as making seizures or falling into the consumption of substances as a means of combating them, and as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers are talking about the connection between oppression and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
"Abstaining is how it has the brain to tell you you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of Psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what's best.
If you are exhausted and use that energy to touch guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you see TV, it's possible that you'll be satisfied in a short time, but not in a long time.
"So, if your child is bored and gives you an iPad, it is possible that he will not be drunk anymore, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or to do away with himself," says Professor Fenske.
And "the ability to dosing applies to other situations," she says.
Your child not only learns to enjoy himself alone, but learns to control better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise abortion.
But we should not be too critical with him either.
Our goal should rather be to feel comfortable apart from the constant noise of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our view, we need to burn more, but it is a very anxious and worrying desire to relate it to something that deserves the punishment," he says.
It points out that what people really are looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
"In a environment where we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it's difficult to find ways to focus our attention when noise stops."
Colored: without a book of instructions for the new law on marijuana consumption
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community institute and footballist in southeastern Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: the possession of Marihuan stones and a pipe used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends drove through Lamar, in the woods near the Kansas border, when the police stopped them.
The police found Marihuan in the car and soon thereafter Orozco received a legal quote for possession of drugs and related articles (lower crimes involving every $100 fine) in which he was informed of the date of trial.
"They treat us like criminals," says Orozco.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote held in Colorado for the legalization of small quantities of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of cases lower than in the law of the location.
Hundreds of minor crimes in marijuana possession are being cancelled both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was adopted.
Police departments have ceased to present charges against 21-year-olds on small-scale possession, which will be legally approved once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But Colorado's most conservative district taxes have committed themselves to continuing with the open cases of marijuana possession and are still referring to people.
At the same time, several cities, from the outbacks of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent the opening of marijuana shops, recently authorised, in their communities.
"All this is changing so fast that I don't know what will be next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those who are in charge of regulations in the state of Washington are also returning to the matter.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacture, distribution and sale licences, all before the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that, for good or for bad, Colorado goes ahead of most states in relation to the regulation of the use of marijuana, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colored has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, a representative of the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions on what could work.
"There is no previous truth that serves us as a model," he says.
The Law of Washington, called I-502, entered into force on 6 December, which also leaves a year during which two waters will be born, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but the possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues to be resolved during that period, such as the way to maintain a balance between the state's requirement to provide an "appropriate access" to authorised marijuana and its prohibition of carrying out cannabis business on a radio less than 300 metres from schools, parks, children's play areas or children's centres.
"In no way will it be more difficult to place an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, a spokesman of the Centre for Legal cannabis, a recently created research group.
On 21 November, Oates, the chief of police of Aurora, sent an e-mail to his police officers informing them that the city's prosecutor would cease to introduce judicial actions for minor mistakes in possession of marijuana to persons over 21 years of age and that the police would cease to present charges against those crimes "with immediate effect".
The Chief of Police Oates said they would be responsible for the implementation of the city's law governing marijuana cultivation for therapeutic purposes and would continue to be pursued by drug dealers and sellers.
In the county of Weld, in northern Colorado, the district tax collector, Ken Buck, represents a more strict vision.
After the vote, he made sure that his office would continue to pursue the cases of possession of marijuana, mainly to pressure consumers and decide to receive treatment.
At present, 119 people face loads of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other duties.
"Our office has the obligation to intervene in judicial action against those errors that were committed at the time they were committed," said Mr. Buck in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places such as the rural county of Mesa, where voters have rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana.
The Grand Junction police, the largest city in the county, no longer mention adults with small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the prosecutor of the county district, supported this decision, but also decided not to disprove any of the cases pending for possession.
"I don't think it's wasting time continuing to comply with the law until this change takes place," he said.
Although 55 per cent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that the use of marijuana for recreational use within the government and the judicial system would be easy.
Contradictive reactions from all over the state show a marked ambivalent between staff regarding the great ecological experiment in this state.
"It's a cultural barrier to the district tax," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents the suspects in possession of marijuana and is a local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of the marijuana Law.
"They've been taking people to court for so long that, in fact, they can't accept it as legal," he said.
By being the first states to consider the small amounts of marijuana in the same way that if it was alcohol, Colorado and Washington are prepared to become a national test case on drug law.
While lawyers and state officials have a new legal border, they also look forward to receiving instructions from the federal government, which still provides for the consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The defenders of the law of marijuana hope that the Department of Justice will grant it.
Despite the fact that some outstanding arrests have been made by marijuana patients and sellers for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has allowed in most of its businesses to sell marijuana with these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 more states.
"Although anti-drug agents are probably not taking doors down to confiscate a small drug bag, they are likely to be able to show reactions to the operation of markets regulated by the state for the sale of marijuana for recreational use permitted by the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, an anti-drug policy examiner of Obama's administration.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local governments adopted moratoriums on any new marijuana store, although it will take about a year before any of them can be opened.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and it is likely to approve the coming week.
"We do not want to put ourselves in a situation in which we allow someone and then we have a serious federal problem," explained Bob Nicholson, a member of the association.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favour of what the community voted against to vote in favour of what the state voted for."
There are many questions about this.
Petronella Wyatt: "I've been stoned to Oxford for being a Tory."
University won't be attacked for your point of view only now
I don't remember any moment in my life when I wasn't dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in what I thought was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that promoted the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, at the end of the 1980s, after two weeks of occupying my place in the Worcester College to run the history race, I had already done the suitcases, which set off the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down and cried.
My friends were upset.
The Evening Standard said I had left because I did not tolerate that some university colleagues kept sexual relations in the room next door.
Writer A. N. Wilson announced that I had gone because I was forced to drink in uncooked bags.
The truth was less fun.
Get out of there.
Yes, yes, because he had been subjected to an austerity and intimidation.
Not due to my extraordinary name, not to the fact that he would come from a private school.
I was told for a single reason, that at the bottom of the so-called illustration there was something shocking and barbarous: my father, the dead Woodrow Wyatt, was an outstanding adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
Maybe they're wondering what's going on now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of right-wing students are suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred towards the students of the Conservative Party is such in Oxford that a group of them last week claimed the same level of equality of rights as homosexuals, disabled persons and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (grade student group) of Corpus Christi College state that they are "often seriously separated, personally attacked and treated as ungrateful people" by their political ideas.
They want to create a position in the Equal Opportunities Committee of their college college to ensure that they can express their views freely.
His situation was not favored by a recent documentary by the BBC2 called "Wenderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" on student policy and presented to the Tories as excentrical and neonazis.
He showed the postgraduate student Joe Cooke, president of the Association of the Conservative Party of Oxford University (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, lighting a plated dress and a bag with the money stamp.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "turkey heads" by introducing higher matrix rates.
Luke Black, a 20-year-old vice-president of the Conservative Party of the University of Nottingham, stated in a Dominican newspaper that "there is a growing tendency of leftovers in universities.
People assume that we are like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing us."
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi who presented the motion for greater protection, says this environment is "failed", while Stephanie Cherill, 19-year-old elected president of the OAU, says that the attitude of the members of the JCR towards people who are at the right centre has improved.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual debate environment, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
During my first weeks in Oxford he was more alone than one.
I entered the university in September 1986, was an 18 - year - old very shy young man.
The hatred towards the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
Last year, the university had voted to reject Margaret Thatcher, an ancient student, a title "honoris cause" after the cuts in the funding of higher education.
The environment would have made any Stalinist freak out.
Already during the first days of the week of welcome to new university students, when new students met and met the cathedrals, I received a sample of the darkness I was looking for.
I found out that the cathedrals not only had a good look at the mofa that was made of the conservative university, but they had a good interest in it.
The policy of miners shooting, privatization and opposition of the government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the seminar's wooden rooms.
At first, I had to translate French texts into English in the 18th century and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Mr. Wyatt," said cathedral Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
He doesn't say one.
Pitt, a humble man with a face that looked like a lot of biscuits, knew well how to get out of bad cars.
"Is it that socherists refuse to learn French, or is it simply that they are aunts?" he asked.
The other colleges were laughing.
They burned my eyes on the tears that I tried to contain.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your free time, always and when I'm not too busy knowing people," Pitt said.
I came back to my room as a soul in pain.
That night I felt alone at the time of dinner at the university; then I felt a light palm on the back.
He was a second-year English student named James who presented himself as a member of the OAUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
"I'm afraid that's how it's going.
They deal with anyone who is suspicious of being Tory.
For me it's very complicated, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be even worse for you.
Many Tories have recently come to appear to be workers."
Later, in a local pub, I tried deliberately to dissimulate.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
That trick proved useless.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economy who, paradoxically, had studied in Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist hero.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I've become a perverted sushi.
"How do the Tories have sexual relations?" asked one.
"They give each other a hug, don't they?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could I take a normal life in Oxford someday?
Would I be obliged to stay with people who would think of me only after dinner?
Should I be a worker and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years I was expected were presented as a Purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only open cathedral Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History for my university college.
They hated him not only for being the Conservative Party, but also for Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was just there.
He hated the place for which he considered it provincial and insignificant and for his adherence to the Marxist-Determinist vision of history.
In 1997 he accepted a cathedral at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he said.
I began to move from Oxford daily to my parents' home in London, finding refuge in my family and friends with more open metropolitan mentality.
I told my father that he hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 40s, all political viewpoints were accepted.
"But if it's the best place in the world," he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear tears of sleep.
Even my Communist friends always had an impeccable attitude."
His painful eyes began to glow.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they've done it just to brom.
I would have broken my heart if you left it."
Overwhelmed by many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had been under pressure and had given up his faith.
The following week, during a seminar in which another cathedral of History had insinuated, speaking totally seriously, that I was a "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
I admitted that my parents had "screamed the brain" and called them "old stupid."
The market took a little time.
It was my father who put the last key in my university career in Oxford.
That's why my father wrote two columns a week in Murdoch's press.
My door was locked with key.
I was in a hurry of fear and, five minutes ago, my pursuers disappeared.
When the suitcase was made and I picked up the first train in London.
I never returned.
Maybe you're calling me weak.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only trained 14 prime ministers of the Conservative Party but, today, is hiding behind a reputation of no merit for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notority"
Due to the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Costura", which has opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian designer customers
Somerset House, an ancient residence of Isabel I in England, is the only place in the British capital to receive an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the opening of "Valentino: Master of the Costura", a retrospective apotheic that gathers more than 130 high-cost clothing created by its "maison" over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his inconclusive Italian accent.
This sample is the cover of a story whose only protagonist is "il sir" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its different customers.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the energized and distant world of Christmas.
In the first room of this exhibition, it opens up until March 3rd, many private letters and photos with the signature of the most prized aristocratic, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through the Princess Marie-Cantal of Greece and Margarita of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: a humble modest pride in the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to an image of the international "jet-set".
Being in love with reality has nothing to do with it.
"At least they don't close the hills of their pills on your magnificent carpet as they make some beautiful celebrities of pop music," says Baronessan Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all liked to be invited to your chalet in Gstad," explains the exhibition of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate of forgotten beauty like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza, lighting a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the modist.
Many years ago, after a demonstration in Piazza di Spain, in Rome, we went to dinner at its floor.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the room, decoration, food, music, everywhere was seen and felt his spirit.
"To each of the guests it made us feel important and loved," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the High Costure Week in Paris in 1995.
"Never passes in fashion because their designs are works of art," finished.
Synchronising folder
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessives, but of well-recorded love.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of somerset House's gallerys has been transformed into a glamorous 60-metre passeral that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to stand by the passage to observe a "audience" of the studio that lights Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristótels Onassis, the dresser who used Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a wool and leather coat belonging to the Emperor Farah Diba.
In this public of manicures, names such as he de Sibilla de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thorn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Noruga, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sofia de Habsburg are rejected.
Naty Abascal and the modest, in 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentine is like the first love, "it's impossible to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a "gillette" jacket and a jacket from the 1971-1972 autumn collection.
"It was a gift he made me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I prefer him above others for his feminity, for his great love for women, because it enhances our beauty," added the former Duchess of Feria.
I love the colors that they use, they have great light and they're "given" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion prescriptor Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberghampoco can forget the first time he saw a Valentine.
When I was a teenager and living in Italy, I dreamed of getting to have the age and opportunity to use one of their night clothes...
The time finally arrived at the end of the 1990s.
Buy my first Valentine's dress to use at a party in my first castle, Prince Edouard de Linen.
It was a red suit, with a fall of flights, "corsage" drawn and heard a word of honor.
"It was a dream made reality," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is independent of fashion, his obsession is temporary," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her fashionable wedding clothes with "the best care... because a dress is not only a dress, it's also the set of memories that it takes."
The King of Mode
The great end of the exhibition of Somerset House is the bride-to-pearl of Marie-Cantal Miller in her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the modest one calls its costumes) to develop that yellow-colored silk suit with iron intrusions, twelve different types of coating and a four- and-a-half-metre neck.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a shadow of the high cost of the end of the 20th century, "the return of high society customers".
Observable for years with the "know-how" of the elite, now Valentino is his best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the distinction of the highest rank in Italy), Cavalier del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Letres, co-ordinated with the Legion de Honor, Garavani collects both the honor and any of its clients' husbands.
"He has always called me attention to his refining, his calmness, his beautiful and perfect aspect," recognized D'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago in a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a big friend of mine.
"It was impenetrable, time doesn't pass for him."

The world's toughest office: Kawah Ijen's human walls
For four euros, Indonesian volcano carriers judge life and health by carrying 70 kilograms of oil through stone pumps
There are people for whose work is hell and others who, literally, work in hell.
It is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by taking off the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To that end, it must descend every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulfurous gas generated from Earth's ingredients is solidified by entering into contact with the air.
After putting large steel rocks, which totally weigh about 70 pounds [70 kg], they fall on two rubber straps that carry on their shoulders through stone slabs.
They are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters high, but the bare-footed porters are more than 40 minutes late to climb to the top of the volcano, keeping the balance and measuring with ten steps so that they do not resuscitate and fall by the precipice.
They know that any delay could cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who died years ago because of the risks of Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners win 5 cents of euro per kilogram of oil they extract
Once on top, there is a step between tourists who photographed them as if they were circular monks and, effectively carrying the weights of the cannas, walk three kilometers to the balance that a mining company has placed a little lower, to 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Grymbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and never better told its workers that it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) per kilo of oil.
He then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is generalised in everyday life and is used to produce cereals, artificial fires, cosmetics, dynamites and even white sugar.
"As usual is to load 70 kilograms, we take out some 46,000 rupees (3,8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who often carries three daily doors.
It is three hours late each time, and it's finished, but it's allowed to join 138 000 rupees (EUR 11.5) at the end of the day.
Although it seems like a misery for such inhuman effort, it's the triple of what would win in the field.
"The miners' journal is very high here, where the collection of coffee is paid to 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros) the day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the porter, who previously worked as an Albanian on the island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the tajo was not so hard, but Ant has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a heavy reason that, in Indonesia, turns out to be as confusing as the Zufer: "I married a young man from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought him to Java to become a Muslim".
Then he has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27 years of age, Then he took three to play the skin in the Kawah Ijen, whose breath has already begun to pass billing despite covering his face with a special mask and gloves.
It has asthma, it breathes with difficulty, it is constantly shaking and its eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that release the volcano.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I'll work for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," promises in a more acceptable English.
Punished by life, this nice and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a guest or a receptionist at a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mill.
Sharing an unclean wooden cable with other carriers, it rises every day to the two of the madrugadas because the oil does not leave off at night, when its distinctive yellow color becomes blue and bright in the midst of darkness.
Defining the shadows, And then down to the crater with a little crater attached to his pocket, which he himself bought with his money.
Some 400 carriers load the oil jars over their homs from the bottom of the crater
Despite its advantages, the mining company has not been able to extract the oil to save costs or to provide no equipment to the carriers, who work for their account and so much the weight.
In fact, they are not even part of the 30,000 rupees (€2.5) of the camera that, along with the introduction of 15,000 rupees (€1.2), the guards of this natural park cover tourists who visit to photograph the volcano and its human walls.
"This work is for animals and not for people," Madrusin protested, a 42-year-old supplier who goes to Kawah Ijen for three decades, since he left the college.
You can raise up up to 110 kilograms, make sure you'll be able to work "all you can" because you need the money to educate your three children from 18 to 10 years of age.
I'm not gonna wake up, I'm gonna die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although the salt burns the throat and listens to the eyes when the wind changes improvisation and traps the miners in the thick columns that emerge from the volcano, they are so hard that no one dares to suffer serious diseases... more, of its usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and joints, which have been damaged by the weight of the bones.
Balancing the canast on its back, Unainik can only load 50 kilos to its 53 years of age.
Every day, he and his companions start 15 tons of oil on the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamanasari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a hair road between the disease.
"I'm not going to wake up, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," says Unainik, opening his mouth well, where he misses several teeth.
Of his five children, the older man, aged 30, also works as an azufre.
Time goes on, but poverty per generation is one of the toughest offices in the world: what makes the human mussels of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the career, stress and cost of property and education for not having children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm a patriot husband, you're my patriot wife, we fulfill our civil duty and we create life!
These verses may seem invertable to be part of a propaganda of lies, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral in YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as "Let's put a boo (bollo) in the horn" to withdraw from Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, offers the hope that with the announcement they will be able to call attention to the problem in a funny way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said I wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfil their "national duty".
This is something purely online, so we had to make it fun and fun.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst people in the world to play ourselves, so we feel that this was a subject we had to deal with.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as launching perfumes with pheromones or organizing quick-dating calls.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we think, why don't we do the most creative thing we can do to solve this problem, which is to make a rap?
1,2 children
What is not taken so easily is the Government of Singapore.
It costs US$1,300 per year in policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity licences and grants tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a city of rich and high-tech state in Southeast Asia, also known as the conservativeism of its leaders and strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population division, is currently located in 1.2 children per woman.
The last time I was over 2-known as a replacement rate was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Division, says it is due to "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"That has allowed people to have a wider range of choices in terms of goals and priorities, beyond marriage and family formation," he explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in loneliness, and the delay of marriage and births, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aims to increase the immigration to deal with the reduction of the population has created a feeling among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where xenophobic is only spread against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who criticize the low wages and do not integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the Singapore government party experienced its worst election result from independence.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and records for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in birth rate has an impact on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has had to control the number of small apartments known as "spats box", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have 46 square meters surfaces and have been very successful in selling.
However, there is concern that they can promote a lifestyle of singleness and discourage developers who want to build large, family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that their "spare shoes" are sold much faster than the larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units spend days, even weeks, faster than units of greater size.
This makes it much better for our box flow.
It admits, however, that new standards provide clearer guidance for developers, which had previously been made available to them if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city of state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national nature rate, talking to Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre seems to have little effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are expensive and also educational, so many people are putting it on," says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important for me to count on my own money and time," says another young man of about 20 years.
Men and women mention their career, stress and cost of property and education as reasons for preventing them from having children.
So, because the government is trying to force its citizens to have children, when it comes to having babies, Singaporeans are the ones who have the last word.
Private offline line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Academy of Spain, it is the quality of privacy or "the area of private life which is entitled to protect from any introduction".
What's private for a 16-year-old?
How does this definition apply in your daily life and in social networks?
Do you understand the dangers posed by venting on the Internet situations that would certainly not be shared out of line?
the Peruvian interviewed five boys between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term "something very mine", in the personal plan, and "in the key and user name", when they applied it to social networks.
"More deep secrets would not go up to a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of privacy on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom can meet them, but not everyone else," she says.
In FB, you'll find beautiful images or games.
I'm also interested in my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that wasn't mine, or someone who's making the joke," he says.
The child recognises that it is wrong to publish obscenaries, of naked persons, of crimes, or to write embarrassing or violent comments.
Jorge makes sure to meet the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
Open Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just going up there," he adds.
"Social networks are busy, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
There is no doubt that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I wouldn't do anyone who would recommend it to a stranger.
The case of Joseph, 14 years old, is different.
The teenager has open accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in this latest admission does not know 20 of the people who are listed as friends.
"Don't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one has been insinuated to him or asked for his home address or phone number.
"If they push me or just ask me for my bag," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not jealous of the experiences of what is today known as cyberbulling.
To an acquaintance of a friend of mine, they were exorcising him on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"I don't know who it was," I assure you.
The victim, according to Joseph, did not close the account.
"I just put them in private."
Then explain a series of steps to configure the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would take pictures of strangers in uncomfortable or pregnant situations.
Yeah, I'd, if I got hurt or I'd like it.
"Although I know that's cyberbulling," he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and licensed in Education and Education, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites, the rules of the game have changed," he says.
Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, master at Pediagía by Yale University and author of the work Natives and Digital Migrants, has raised these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are them, children and young people born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants we have to teach them, while we are still learning," he says.
Please note that the subject is complex, "because we are asking them to have a defined criterion on what it is appropriate or not to spread, publish or say to an age that adults do not give to that."
"They also have to be selective when what matters most is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach what privacy is for children and adolescents is through questions that make them reflect.
"Tell them it doesn't work," he adds.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to publish a photo of you like you published by a friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you took photos of parties, did you ask the other people to label them?
And one more, everyone needs to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they should act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"A outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, as well as social networks," he says.
Watch
Esturado Guardia, university cathedral, primary teacher and educational consultant, notes that it is essential that the parents of the family learn the policies of social networks.
By understanding each of the implications, they have solid foundations to discuss with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children of the lesson of "not talk to strangers".
Finalize the Unashur Summit without making the Lima Declaration public
The VI Presidential Summit of the South American Union (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven sponsors.
The Effe sought repeated opportunities to access the document signed at the VI Ordinance of Heads of State and Government of the Unashur, but sources of Chancellor and Presidency indicated at the outset that they would deliver it after the closure, but then they stated that it would be published on the Peruvian Government website at some point.
Upon consulting the text, they noted that the content had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief press statements.
The access of journalists to the information of the Summit was limited at all times.
During the day alone, the unsound video of the presidential assembly was transmitted in the press room with the message "private, restricted audio".
The few information that was circulated among the reporters was provided by press carriers from some of the Unasur Governments attending the appointment, although not Peruvian.
The only document published during the day was the list of attending presidents, which resulted in the abuse of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more data.
Subsequently, the Perun Presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is about the statement of Humala, not the official document that closed the summit.
In October last, Peru was the host of the Third American Summit of the Arab South-West Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite the demand for the press, also the so-called Lima Declaration had been announced.
The official website of ASPA can confirm that the document was published last March.
In both international accounts, Peruvian authorities worked to ensure transmission systems for all journalists but to a lesser extent limited access to information.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a failure by the Hague Court to establish a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, met during the regional conference and ratified that they would respect the decision of the ICJ, which began Monday in La Haya to listen to the allegations of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will reach and execute the sentence that defines the differences we are taking to this international court today," Humala said, along with her Chilean couple.
" Chile has been, it is, and will continue to be a respected country of international law, the peaceful solution of disputes, treaties and international courts," Piñera added, and welcomed Humala, along with the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both Presidents that they would be subjected to ICJ took place after Colombia declared the Bogotá Covenant this week that it had accepted to submit to the errors of that international court, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered gravely wrong.
The summit was held with the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Roseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended by Unasur since 2011, after the resignation of former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the appointment.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the debate in the morning and closing the summit shortly after the media in Lima.
The author read the final document in which 16 agreements had been concluded and the lines of action for 31 projects between South American countries were established for a total of $17 billion in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, it stated that the countries of UNASUR will make " important steps towards the goal of a South American citizen for what we are expanding the housing agreements".
It was reported that actions to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make drugs more accessible, low-cost Internet access in all parts of South America, and to address the risks of natural disasters in a coherent and efficient manner".
With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (from Latin America) must not have a triunphalist matrix but must serve to expand our productive matrix and see a better future for our people," Humala added.
"We have decided to privileged a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas, joining our countries and generating new economic circuits," the Peruvian president said in a message read.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the transversal islands of his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give more details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for its reintegration into the South American Union," which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations among neighbors was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this regard, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before his participation in the regional conference he hoped to meet with his partner in Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to deal respectfully with the maritime difference after a failure of the ICJ, raised by Bogotá.
"The morning (Saturday) is possible to have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We are going to review all these paths, not exclusive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he said.
"With President Ortega I hope to be able to tell him that we manage this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would be in Mexico on Saturday, where they would be planning to attend the command of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Ministers for Defence of the Block met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen the dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are integrated into UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the presidency for the time being of the regional block.
"Suramerica must learn from Europe to integrate a citizen": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's President, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizen is a goal in which "Suramerica, in this case yes, must learn from Europe".
Korea, who participated in the VI Presidency Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, declared to the Peruvian state TV that Europeans "were killed in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but are now practically a patriot".
In that regard, the project to establish South American citizenship was defended by the Union's member countries.
"The free mobility of citizens and workers in any South American country must be achieved, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactive sectors that want us to return to the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President showed himself in favour of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise to renegotiate the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and to take into account those who have signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who give cathedra never make a commitment to anything, and instead, we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States," said Julian Assange, in allude to the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa made sure that she was not repentant of that decision because she had not betrayed her principles, but had respected her "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that, at his time, "there were doubts that Assange had been extradited to a third country and did not respect its process".
He also criticized Swedish justice for demanding that he be subjected in his territory to interrogation for a alleged sexual crime when "the Swedish law itself allows him to conduct it through a video conference, which could be done from Ecuador's embassy in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk of deterioration in Assange's physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small pulmonary problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian mandater.
What is true is the danger of damaging your physical and mental health by being locked in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"That's complicated the health of any person," he added.
Correa noted that the asylum solution given to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by granting a rescue guide that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been conversations with London for a solution at the end of WikiLeaks Founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange, Baltazar Garzón's lawyer, is making a series of procedures in different European courts," he said.
And he thought, "If Great Britain tomorrow, this rescue is over."
And if Sweden, as perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, asks Mr. Assange at Ecuador's embassy in London or asks him about Skype himself tomorrow this problem is over.
It is useful to reaffirm itself as a defender of press freedom, and it has been pointed out that what does not tolerate is "mediacy, evil faith and lie, which distort freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of freedom of press are not evil and evil politicians but bad journalists in terms of profit, singing and exorcism," he said.
In this respect, it was welcomed that these journalists are no longer "bankers or hegemonic countries and bourgeois people who dominate Ecuador", and that to be re-elected "will deepen in the revolution to continue the right path and direction".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto in Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the organization "should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and the legalized strike" because in fact "disrupted the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy".
The Ecuadorian President also considered the "perfectly relevant" wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate now with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the failure of the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which benefited from the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
That's not happening right now.
It's a problem between a South American country and a Central American.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They must be widely processed to overcome them and continue to progress.
He also relied on a good conclusion to the maritime dispute held in the same court in Peru and Chile and considered that "it is right for Latin America to seek international courts if both countries are committed to accepting a serious failure".
Regarding the possibility of being present as a candidate at the next presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive mandate, he noted that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa made sure that if she loses February 2013 she will withdraw from public life.
In staff I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as Ecuador's socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed that likely victory, because we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
To win would be my last period in the presidency, and from there we went out of public life.
If we lose the same thing.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked to the Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolas Maduro and he told me that he was on his way to a treatment that had been planned, routinely, that was expected to take the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean a return to the health status of President Chávez," he said.
The Head of State of Ecuador participated today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the United States of America (Unasur), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
Deaths by AIDS today are the cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 when he was confirmed the results of the test: positive AIDS.
"It was as if a bomb had fallen on me," he said when he remembered the moment of the announcement, that the doctor tried to make "more milder", with no apparent success.
The boy hid it in his family.
He decided to take care of his disease alone and began to inform about it; with such zeal that he had already celebrated his 43th birthdays.
It is, of course, one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit in Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), which arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio lives with the virus of human immunodeficiency (HIV) 22 years ago, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic refused to leave him "because he brought a cut."
So having AIDS was a sign of death.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and do it with quality of life.
However, unaware of their disease, many still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "takes" its immunological system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of AIDS in the world, at least the first cases reported, "the great achievement means at this point that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in an timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG HIV Unit Chief Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after mentioning that this information was completed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS has not been a fatal judgment, but survival and quality of life depend on the degree of exposure to the immunological system that patients present when they start diagnosis, with better expectations for those who are not drug users: 200 CD4 and 50 years of age, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, the previous means that those who receive the positive diagnosis of HIV at 25 years of age, under these terms "as long as they remain in control they can live without problems up to 75 years," the interviewer explained.
To measure this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has significantly decreased in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people who die from AIDS decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have been missing since the AIDS phenomenon.
Only 255 people died in Jalisco in 2011, and are dying 187 to May this year; however, universal access to anti-retroviral drugs has been ensured since 2005.
- Why are you still dying?
- I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it happened at our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have not had a drug deficit the problem is that patients get very advanced because they do not know their condition of infection, that is, in late stages of the disease.
He said: "N nine out of every ten patients arrive when they already present some opportunistic infection that has to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality, it is to do more early diagnosis and, therefore, it is necessary to offer evidence of mass detection to all those who require it."
In its proposal, experts and staff of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (Cosided), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had tried to do the test at a particular laboratory, only motivated by having done so a friend and, despite their short-term age, had already been in AIDS and even sarcoma suffering from Kaposi, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, I'd better come back three times a week," they say not in my case.
The change was to improve, feed me well, exercise, take drugs.
At the time, his parents only knew he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but responsible, I care for myself and the other person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILLENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony to those who today, within the framework of the World City Day, are afraid.
That they are tested, if they were at risk, that they will soon know if they are positive HIV, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, that they learn that they can live as any person, being responsible.
This, its message, summarizes the AIDS battle theme this year 2012.
Condones after the display
Large are the eggs that are among the health programmes and the common citizen, supported Ricardo Salazar, an acceding journalist who has taken the blame on HIV.
And the biggest is prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "the share of convictions has actually increased, before they gave us one or two, now give us packages of a hundred, and that's very good but it turns out that some people today still have no access to a condon," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want them to do?" is a common question, with noise and valuable judgements from social workers, school guides, pharmaceuticals and health staff, to whom adolescents do not want to be exposed, the communiqué assured.
I propose to re-direct this ineffective distribution; the condones are not only after the showers and the hundreds are found in public bathrooms in the places where young people frequent.
It's not motivated by promiscuity.
It is not about paying the bills and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied, by asking him if there would be a distribution of condoms in his administration.
"That's not sexuality, it's best to approach the convictions of those who are already practicing sexual activity," he said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cases accumulated (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4th national place in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th HIV.
92% of the infections are sexual, 6% are blood, and 2% are perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can be living with HIV because, in a recorded case, there are 4 to 5 people who do not know.
Ratified by a U.S. Appeals Tribunal a judgment that does not recognize the restructure of the Vitro Group's debt achieved through a commercial competition in Mexico, the scenario puts a bad precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighbouring country with solvency problems.
It would be said, therefore, that procedures for the survival of signatures allowing Mexican laws are invalid in the country of bars and stars, contrary to international conventions.
In the practical field, the support to the judgment issued on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bancarrots Court for the northern district of Texas leaves no defence to Mexican firms against the possibility of putting their properties in the Bravo area.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to the Supreme Court of the United States, claiming three inconsistencies.
In the meantime, while the judge of the case points out that creditors should be governed by the United States Quebec Act, the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure is the market competition processed in Mexico.
The first point would be to ignore international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of undertakings with transnational profile.
In fact, to that end, the United Nations Model Law on the Equality of International Market Law was created, setting itself as the tree of the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the vote of intercompaniments, recognised in the critical mass of the commercial competition the debts of the Fitro branches with their mother would not have been achieved by the majority required to approve the restructuring.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted.
There are average dozen examples, including Agremex and Mexican Commercial, whose debts were assessed by the Federal Institute of Mercantile Competitions.
The truth is, in addition, that by remaining the votes of the branches, in all ways the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the United States Courts, the "buitre" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited will not be achieved by most.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37.
The date shall be suspended by the Court of Appeal.
From another angle, this blames Vitro of the difficult situation he faced from 2008 to the slowdown of the serious economic crisis he faced in the United States, bringing the collection to the country.
The signature of the Gonzalez Sada family will therefore involve a re-examination appeal before the Court of Appeal so that the vote will be brought to its full, i.e. the five judges, since they voted only three.
In the absence of this, it will be claimed that the Court of Justice of the United States requires the review of the proceedings by a higher body, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The gravity of the case is that the court submitted a document submitted by the Government of Mexico under the form of friends curiae ("friend of the Court"), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the Mercantile Competition Act, noting that it was rejected by both countries with a view to sending it under Chapter 15 of the United States Banks Act.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, namely the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for creditors and creditors.
Two bands: they catch Vitro and catch him in the country.
Balance
For several months the allegations filed at the table by Mexican Aircraft unions against the company's expulsion, Gastón Azcarraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudful administration, had already found the bottle box.
The Tribunal headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking Commission and the Valores against whom justice is accused.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has consistently refused to report to the General Prosecutor General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the businessman to extract from Bank IXE F/589 credit, on behalf of Mexico, 198 million dollars.
The resources would have been channelled to the purchase of operations by the Professional Hotel Administrator.
As you know, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Seek to Dragon Mart
At the end of the week at a forum at the University of Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, of a shopping mall and street distribution in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of the country's products in the wall, with a living area at the foot for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra had managed to unify the rulers of the western area to oppose the monumental thing that had been pulled out of protected areas and planted the mother of all the hideous anti-industrials.
ACTA died
Under what terms and circumstances the Ambassador of Mexico in Japan signed the Anti-Falsification Trade Agreement, known as the ACTA, in accordance with the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the case had already been referred to the archive.
As you know, the action was given despite the fact that the Senate itself had failed to assess the possibility of considering it as a reminder of freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term Homex
In addition to paying long-term debts without affecting short-term loans, the Homex housing developer is placing on the market Certified Bursatiles by 500 million weights.
The issue is the first of four identicals that offer to pay interest every 28 days.
Nice Competival
Integrated by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet companies, information technology leaders, has just been born with a partnership with a Competival social reason, whose objective will be the market of software cluster services in Central and South America.
Investments in the area exceed $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "The balloon has been my life"
Trotamunds of the Balonese Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years ago linked to the sport of the table and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
A few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of the local balloonist as wide as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
And it's true that before a brain drain bound him to a wheel chair in 2008, Reyes was involved in sports for more than 60 years, he was a player of lower categories, a player of the National Higher Ballonist, adjoining and leading BSN with the Bayamón Vaceros or president of the Balonesto Federation.
"He put me a lot of nightmares in the balance room through my life, including several at the same time, as when he was president of the BSN, manager general of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a first visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"The balloon has been my life."
Kings don't exaggerate when making that avalanche.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and monuments that denounce his extensive trajectory, thus testify.
Bayammon in the Heart
Of all, those who are most excited are those who remember their step by the Vaceros from the mid-1990s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years of age acting as co-capable or apothecist from the franchise.
"These were my best years, the ones I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be part of the eight Vaceros champions since 1967, already being apothecary, co-author or director.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five champions running from 1971 to 1975.
And then I quit with one in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy started in the BSN.
From then on was the "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," said Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a strong player of 6"7" of the statue.
Do you want it?"
And that was Mincy's beginning, one of the best players who've had Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended to Francotheriar Raymond Gausse, who was born and was one of our best shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy had given him a champion to Bayamon, Gausse would help bring another one.
The Vaqueros champion with Gausse enjoyed it, but it was already far away, so by 1988 it was already federal orders.
For that time, I would like to enjoy its performances and those of Mincy at the National Team.
I remember the first time we won him in the United States during the First Olympics in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World, where we arrived in the fourth place and must have been bronzed not to be by that Canadian tree that made us repeat the final game for the second time, Reyes said.
Is this World Group 1990 the best National Team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like he won the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Spanish people in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave him a pair of shoes to the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that the bronze gained us worldwide.
This team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), but also had "Tunito" Colón and James Carter young brothers, the brothers León (France and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not have been in the 90s due to an injury in the wheelchair.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the 1995 Prelimcanian in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitner replacing players suspended by the river of the American Sea of Malta, we won gold against all prognostics.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
No doubt it was Piculin Ortiz.
Its international tournament numbers are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level as Piculin did.
And that doesn't count his trajectory on the different ligaments he played.
Who's the best bourgeois leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good bed that includes Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
As a young man, I like Leo Arill's work.
What do you think is your greatest success in the federation?
It had been part of the most glorious period of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and was that at the beginning of the 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams at one time.
What's left of you to do?
There were things I would have wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, that Ponce's boys will only play in their area and only face other teams of the island's reindeer in national playoffs.
Even now children travel and play too much unnecessaryly.
At least I see the fruit of the composite and course certifications for leaders, table officials and treedressers.
I'm glad.
What are you doing now?
What I do is listen to music, see videos of the music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes when I go to dance games.
And of course, enjoy my wife's company, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Kills actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, best known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", where he married a man with no scruples, malicious and manipulative business.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnetist J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of adventure in the 1980s, died.
I was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new era of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family communication provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., "Dallas" producer house.
"Lary was back in his beloved Dallas Christmas city, once again representing the iconic role he liked most," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the holiday on Thanksgiving Day.
Linda Gray, who interpreted his wife's role in the original series and the century, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said her publisher, Jeffrey Lane.
He was happy with everything he knew.
It was creative, generous, fun, graceful, loving and talented, and I'm going to surprise him very much.
"He was an original person and lived his life at the most," said Gray in a communiqué.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver surgeons in 1992 and recognized that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995 he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the liver and was subjected to a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", distributed by the NBC chain from 1965 to 1970.
She interpreted to Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was changed when she found a genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and led her to live with him at her house.
He was also a protagonist of two comedies who were short-lived in the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Heer We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included well-received papers from the criticism in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterly interpretation of the lovelyly disgusting J.R. that led Hagman to his greatest star.
The dramatic series of CBS on Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was in the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate expectations about a full episode of emotions in which Hagman's character was almost murdered, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars in shelters.
It also helped to give him a record of audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a chapter of November 1980, an average of 41 million televisions were synchronized and converted to Dallas in the second most visible entertainment programme of history, following the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was the funeral of J.R., Kristin (translated by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. pregnant her and then threatened her with prostitution unless she left town, but others also had reasons to attack her.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an insatiable corruption with a charismatic smile: a corrupt entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), into exile.
"I know what I want in the J.R." Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here comes the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal he's lost.
Major Victoria, co-protagonist of the original series, reminded Hagman of Friday as someone "great, inside and out of the screen".
It is inevitable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each one of us, that we had the happiness of knowing and loving him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were transmitted a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
The recording of five chapters had already been completed for the second time and a sixth had been in operation, the chain was reported.
There was no immediate speech by Warner or TNT on how the Hagman loss will be managed.
Source of Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who stellered classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he had it in 1931 during his marriage with attorney Ben Hagman.
He was successful in the theatres in New York in the early 1950s and then served at the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived in the California city of Malibu for a long time, where many celebrities live.
In 2001 he wrote his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolute Truth) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything there that I thought would be hurting someone or affecting them in some way," said the Associated Press at that time.
After the liver transplant, he became a donor of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help the fearful patients.
"I advise them, I value them, I gather with them when they come to their surgery, and then," he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, such as "not afraid, it will be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but it will be fine".
He was also an activist against smoking habit and participated in several campaigns.
Start a course that explores the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was counting on an irresponsibility: The end of the "long regressive account" of the Maya Calendar, on 21 December, to which many people have been arrested as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea of what he expected in the next few months: The Vatican cataclysmic Sandy, a fiscal prepique that some have called "deudarmagedon" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theories at the end of the time believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I don't realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester that has ever been," said Charmé this week to the students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If one analyzes what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period.
And they remember that evil is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only teacher who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last of history.
In Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"Let's analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, could set up a war.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and studied how they were compared with examples of real life.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
In the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of Art and Anthropology History, have made a team to start a course, entitled "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always count on the option to start the course again, if the world isn't over," Restall said.
Despite the "morning disaster", students must study, generate projects and take final reviews.
In Penn State, the final review will be taken in the spring of the Revelation, which leaves students no choice but to work "to the same night in which the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"He was satisfied in two hours," Restall said about his course for high school students, who was filled with 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people asking if there was still a place.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It makes me curious to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology at Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality is just a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Wakesa, a 25-year-old psychologist and nurse student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a class that could teach that," he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - and much less a teacher - said to believe in the expiry date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the Maya prophecy and in some way we mistrust it," said Julie Zeglen, a last year student in Temple, aged 21 and West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it is only one key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is a apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which has been repeated for centuries, in which people react to changes around them by preaching the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
"On the other hand, people don't think about it," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew any course about the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines don't participate in the end of the world," he wrote, suggesting an exception to a superior authority.
We have a Pope's confession.
Restall noted that over the years there have been many days of final judgment, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will begin to think immediately on the next day" or to imagine that 21 December is the beginning of a period of seven years after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the day off.
Several said they thought they'd go to "the end of the world".
"Maybe I call some friends to see us together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
