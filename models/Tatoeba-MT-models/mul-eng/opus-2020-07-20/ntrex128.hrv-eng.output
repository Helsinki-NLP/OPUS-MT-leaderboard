Big Savourists are worried that they will "seem like Muppets"
Some members of the Assembly Member (AM) have proposed that they be called Members of the Parliament (MWP) in the future.
This has resulted in plans for the Assembly to be renamed to the Great Parliament.
Sabor's representatives from all political spheres are concerned that they could become the subject of a conspiracy.
A Association Representative from the Laburist Party said his group was concerned about the fact that the name "remotes with Twp and Pwp".
For reading out of Wales: on a large twp means stupid, and pwp jokes.
Sabor's representative from the Starke Wales (larger, Plaid Cymru) said the group was "not satisfied" and submitted alternative solutions.
The large conservator stated that his group was "open" to change the name, but that MWP can be quickly converted to Muppet.
In this context, the word "w" is similar to the meaning of the word "u" in the German English.
The Saborian Committee, which is currently preparing the law to introduce a change of name, agreed as follows: “Of course the final decision will be about how the Savorian representatives will be entitled to be on their own."
The law of the Wales government in 2017 gave the Grand Chamber the authority to change its name.
In June the Committee published the results of the public consultation on proposals that were found in broad support for the change of the name of the chamber in the Grand Parliament.
When it was about what representatives would be called the Assembly, the Committee was calling the "Members of Parliament" or the MWP, but the MWP option received the largest support during the public consultation.
Sabor officials suggest alternative options, but the struggle to achieve consensus could bring more head-over to the president of the chamber, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a proposal for a change of law within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include other changes in the way the Council works, including rules on the disqualification of the representatives of the Assembly and the establishment of the Committee's system.
During the debate on the law of the Savorian Republic, a vote will be taken on the question of how they want to be called.
Macedonians go to the referendum on the change in country names
The voters will vote on Sunday whether they want to change their country's name in the "Northern Republic of Macedonia".
The purpose of the vote is to resolve a multiannual dispute with a neighbouring Greece in which a territory called Macedonia is located
Athens has long argued that the name of its northern neighbour represents the property of the Greek territory and has been opposed to the initiation of its process of accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an anti-Pelbistic opposition to the change of the name, said he would not recognise the referendum decision.
However, the rapporteur, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, argues that the amendment is a simple price to be paid for EU and NATO accession.
St. Martin's bells were silenced while the church in Harlem fought for survival.
"The old people I talked to said that in the past they could find a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"No one else today."
He said the disappearance of the baroque was understandable.
"People are friends today in a different way," he said.
"The bars don't represent the living rooms in which people regularly rent."
When it comes to churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as church leaders think and "betrayed or later will be found again at the beginning."
He added that the churches would be able to replace buildings with dwellings in which people who will not help the other churches in the neighborhood will be able to replace them.
"Many people buying apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "that is why it will soon come to the day when these churches will be completely closed because it is unlikely that the inhabitants who have moved into these buildings will become members of those churches."
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis — the metropolitan community of 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The original white methodical congregation was settled in the 1930s.
The black congregation that kept God’s service close to her took possession of the building.
The Church of St. Martin took over a black congregation with a former John Howard Johnson on his head, who also led a fighter on a small street in 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed the recruitment or promotion of blacks.
Fire in 1939 was hard to destroy the building, but since the Züllians of the great-time Johnson planned her reconstruction, ordered down the bell, etc. carillon.
David Johnson, the son of Johnson’s father and heir to St. Martin, proudly called carillon “the voices of the poor people. ”
The expert who played on the carillon in July used another name: "cultural goods" and "unchangeable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, a professor at Michigan University, noted that it was also the first carillon in the world to play the black singer Dionisio A. Lind who has been playing on a larger carillon in the Riverside church for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What is being played in St. Martin over the past few months is the story of architects and builders of construction works, some of which have brought ease to church leaders, and other Episcopal dioceses.
Sakristia, the leading body of the soup made up of lacha, wrote in July that the infant "will try to transfer expenses" to the cleaner, although the cleaner was not involved in the engagement of architects and the construction worker who sent the child.
Some gamblers regretted the lack of transparency on the side of the baby.
A 13-year-old sea horse injured during the hunting in California
According to the official report, on Saturday, the marine dog attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was riding for a horse in California on the day of opening the season of hunting on the yacht.
An attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near the beach of Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel declared to be a KSWB-TV in San Diego that he broke with his friends about an hour and a half in the morning when he heard the boys call for help, and then he sent the group to the scene to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he initially thought that the word of excitement was due to the captured noise, but then he realized that he shouted, "I'm scared!
He hit me!"
Hammel said when he approached the boy he noticed that his whole key bone was broken.
"I was hoping everyone would come out of the water: 'In the water it's a sea dog!' added Hammel.
The boy's helicopter was transferred to the boy's Rady hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The type of marine dog responsible for the attack is unknown.
The captain of the rescue team Larry Giles said at a press conference that the marine dog was caught in this area a few weeks ago, but it was established that it was not a matter of the dangerous species of the marine dog.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma at the top of the body.
At 48 hours the authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto beach in Casablada to Swami in Ecinitas to carry out the search and security of buyers.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 species of seabirds in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sansbury's company plans for entry into the beauty market in UK
Sainsbury’s becomes competition for chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing cosmetic bottles in the style of slave houses and the engagement of specialized sellers.
As a result of a large market entry of UK beauty worth 2.8 billion, which continues to grow in line with the decline in sales of clothing and household equipment, larger cosmetic bottles will be tested in 11 markets across the country and will be expanded to additional trades next year if they are shown to be successful.
The investment in cosmetic products is one of the ways that supermarkets try to use the police space that was once foreseen for televisions, microwaves and household equipment.
The representatives of Sainsbury's company said they would double the size of cosmetic products for 3,000 products, including first time and slave brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And the existing Assortment Company L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will get more space with areas for certain slave brands like Boots.
The Supermarket will re-start its assortment of Boutique decorative cosmetics, so most products will be suitable for vegans, which is what young buyers are looking for more.
In addition, a trader with perfume Fragrance Shop will try to use concessions in two Sainsbury's store, the first one that was opened last week in Croydon in southern London and the second that is opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham this year.
Net purchases and return to daily purchase of small quantities of food in local food stores mean that supermarkets need to make more efforts to attract people.
Mike Coupe, director-in-chief of Sainsbury's, said he'd fly more and more to look like a slave house while this supermarket chain is trying to convince satisfied businesses such as Aldi and Lidl offer more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has introduced in hundreds of shops the outlets of Argos, as well as a large number of the Habitats department because he bought both chains two years ago, which he claimed motivated the sale of living comfort and made this adjudication more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to refresh its cosmetic and pharmaceutical sectors was not successful.
Sainsbury's entered into a joint conversation with Boots in early 2000, but it ended all the way around the medical department's income in his supermarkets.
The new strategy followed after Sainsbury's sale of its pharmaceutical business to the 281 store Celesi, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain three years ago.
He claims Lloyds will have a role to play in the plan by setting up an assortment of luxury products for his skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsburys, said: "We have changed the appearance and direction of our departments with cosmetic products in order to give our users a better environment.
We also put in a special suit a colleague who will be at the hands of the buyers and give them advice.
Our range of trade marks is designed to meet all needs, and attractive environment and availability means that we are now an attractive destination for buying cosmetic products, which will lead to changing old shopping habits."
Peter Jones was "failed" after Holly Willoughby gave up a contract worth 11 million pounds.
The Dragon's De Peter Jones show star is left to "heavy box" after TV director Holly Willoughby gave up a contract worth 11 million pounds with his slave brand to focus on his new contracts with the Marks & Spencer and ITV trading chain
Willoughby doesn't have time for their slave brand of home clothes and fashion supplements Truly.
Their slave brand is compared with the slave brand Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning (37) exhibition director at Instagram announced to leave.
Holly Willoughby left the stars of Dragon's De Peter Jones to cook from the heat by getting out of a joint profit business to focus on its own new wonderful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The source claims that Jones was "beautiful" when a gold girl television during a busy meeting on Tuesday in Marlowe's office in Buckinghamshire admitted that her new contract worth up to 1.5 million dollars means that there is not enough time to devote their slave brand of home clothes and fashion supplements to Truly.
This business was comparable to Goop Gwyneth Paltrow's slave brand and was supposed to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby (37) announced at the Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain in one of his holiday homes.
The source stated: “Truly was one of the greatest Holly priorities.
This should be a long-term investment in the future that would ensure it for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw was all involved in this business.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday so close to the start of the whole line.
In Marlow's warehouse there's a lot of goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that due to the departure of this Morning emissions leader, one of the most widely invested stars in Britain, the company could suffer millions of losses due to the large resources invested in the products in the range of jackets and candles to clothes and household clothing and the possible additional delay of the start of the line.
And that could mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Mother three children Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close friends with Jones and his wife, Tarom Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) joined them as president of the board in March.
Couples spend their holidays together and Jones has a share of 40% in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S slave brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as the leader of the I'm and celebrity I'm.
The source near Jones said last night, "We don't want to comment on his business activities."
Hard talks, and then we fell in love.
He was referring to the criticism that would be received in the newspapers because of comments that some might consider "unsufficient presidents" and because he has such a positive attitude towards North Korea's leader.
"Why did President Trump give so much publicity?"
said Trump, echoing the voice of the leader of the news.
"I didn't give any access."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after his first meeting in Singapore in June called for a great step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization were closed.
More than three months after a meeting in Singapore on Saturday, North Korea's leading diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North did not recognize the "appropriate reaction" of the US to North Korea's disarmament activities.
He noted that instead of that U.S., he has not yet removed the sanctions for which the objective of further pressure is.
In his speech, the trumpet took a much more optimistic attitude.
"We're going great with North Korea," he said.
"He agreed to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had positive results – a stop to trying to launch rockets, help with the release of hostages and the return of the rest of the American soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
So it's easy to behave as president, but instead of waiting for 10,000 people in front of this whole arena in front of us, we would have about 200 people there," Trump said, pointing to a crowd right in front of us.
The tsunamis and floods in Indonesia have devastated the island and killed hundreds of people.
For example, after the attack on Lomboka by non-governmental organisations, it was said that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10 percent of Lomboka’s population has been displaced, there is no declared national disaster, which is a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they were very clear about not seeking international assistance, so this is a little bit problematic," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although the Save the Children organisation consists of a team that will travel to Palu, it's still not sure that side staff will be able to work on the field.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disasters Office, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palau to see if international agencies would be allowed to intervene in the efforts to provide assistance.
In view of the continued support of the soil in Indonesia, this country is still unfortunately not prepared for the handling of anger.
Although the ruins in the case of tsunamis are built in Aceh, it is not something that is common in other parts of the coastal line.
The absence of siren for warning on the tsunamis in Palu, although the warning was in force, probably contributed to the loss of life.
And in the best time travel between numerous Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters add up to the challenge of logistics.
The hospital's ship that was settled in Lombok for the care of the victims of the earthquake is on the way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the place of a new disaster.
The improvement of the Indonesian dissolved structure was the basis of President Jokoa Vidodo's election campaign and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
However, the state administration under Jokoa is struggling with a lack of financial resources, and new elections are being held next year.
Joko is also faced with the pressure of the remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims have gained a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes while the Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with swords, clubs and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Player Liverpool Daniel Sturridge lost a shot to match Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved his life on Saturday Liverpool from defeat in the Premier game against Chelsea in 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an addition from the Sherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 meters from the Chelsea hill to the result of 1:0 for Chelsea.
He transferred the ball to the left leg before he pulled it off to the opposite stop.
The ball flew high above the top right corner of the network.
The ball ran to the end of Cape Arrizabalagaja, which jumped toward her and entered the network.
"It was imperative to come into this position, come to the ball, and players like Shaq always try to get closer to the ball, so I tried to give as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com
"I saw that Kante was coming and I was just a touch ball. I didn't think too much about it and I just shot."
Chelsea was headed at 1:0 in the half hour after the fall of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
The Blue Attacker chased the ball back of Matthew Kovači during this game before he turned somewhere in the field and ran into Liverpool's half.
Kovačić has performed a quick addition to the middle of the field.
Then he led a beautiful passerby ball that Hazard brought to the top.
Hazard wore his armor and his left leg hit a ball in the network at the opposite stop near the goal of Liverpool Alison Becker.
Liverpool plays a club competition against Naples in the League trial in 15 hours on Wednesday at the stadium of Sao Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea is waiting for Videoton at the UEFA European League at 15 a.m. in London on Thursday.
The number of deaths in the Indonesian tsunami increased to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832, and the government's disaster agency was announced early Sunday morning.
A spokesman from Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference that a large number of people had been trapped in the destructions of the building after a magnitude 7.5 collapse, which was felt on Friday and caused waves of even 6 meters high.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is filled with the remains of destroyed buildings.
The police arrested a man (32) for suspecting murder after his wife died.
The murder investigation was launched after the female body found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old girl was found at 07:55 with a fatal wound on Grayson Mews on the street John, and 32-year-old was arrested for suspecting murder.
The police called on people from that area to get in touch if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is still under way, but I would like you to speak to us all who were near John Street in Birkenhead, and they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is of key importance to our investigation."
The police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found in Birkenhead's apartment was found and that she was found in the building.
This afternoon at the scene came friends who thought they knew that woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have announced that it is in the process of informing the nearest victim's family.
The cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that nobody could enter the building or get out of it.
He's left without words when he finds out what happened.
Stanners are now told that they'll be able to return to their homes for a few hours until they can't.
A police officer reportedly told someone that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the crime scene in tears.
It goes on to say, "That's so scary."
At 14:00, two police vans were located in the area, and another was parked directly outside.
A large number of police officers stood inside a built-in area and controlled the state block.
Of all those who have any information is requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, called 101 or anonymously to the Crimestopers organisation at number 0800 555 111, calling on record 247 of 30 September.
Cyprus Cromwell in Parliament is the newest monument that has been held in the middle of the debate on "extreme history"
His prognosis would be poetic justice for almost the Taliban’s destruction of such English cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's company called Mr. Cricka's attempt "foolishness" and "I'm trying to get past history".
John Goldsmit, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the debate that is currently taking place on the removal of the carpet, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell before the Westminster Palace would become the subject of debate.
The iconocratic of English civil wars is not something Cromwell ordered nor passed.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell would have been victimized for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the past century.
The wonderful restoration of Cromwell Sir William Hamo Thornycroft is evidence of the 19th century thinking and part of the history of people for whom many still consider it worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell many think, perhaps by the end of the 19th century, that Parliament's advocate of external pressure, of course, was the pressure of monarchy.
Whether this is a fully credible view of the subject is a historical debate that is continuing.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a unique recognized figure that represents one side of this division.
His achievements in the role of the protector are still worthy of respect and recognition."
The pig killed by a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, pigs attacked and killed a farmer on the market in southwestern China.
A man for whom the name "Yuan" was only mentioned was found dead of pristine arteries and buried blood near the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou published the morning list of southern China on Sunday.
The pig breeder was prepared to suck pigs in the wine on May 30, 2005 in Xining in the Chinese province of Qinghai.
Apparently, on Wednesday he and his cousin from the nearby Yunnan were traveling to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was opened.
He said there was a big man pig with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the pig weighs 250 pounds [250 kg] of the planter to death.
"My family's legs have been bleeding and crushed," said a relative named "Wu."
The security camera footage showed Yuan went into the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his family.
The manager of the market announced for the Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent someone else from attacking while the police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market administration are reportedly negotiating the death penalty.
Although this rarely happens, swine attacks on people have already been reported.
Swinja attacked her wife and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts in 2016 and her husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig more than 300 pounds [300 kg] had a big farm with a tractor until his wife had killed an animal.
After pigs ate farms in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "wig".
"They're just jigsaw.
They're Greek, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just need to show respect," he said.
The rest of Rosa's hurricane brings heavy rain to the southwestern United States
As announced, Urgan Rosa is weak as it passes through the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring rain in the north of Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa was at 05:00 after the east season of the range of 140 km/h, which is made up of Uragan Category 1, and was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific creates a low pressure area and moves towards the western coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the mid-morning Bay of California in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push the deep layer of tropical rain towards the north towards the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical contribution in interaction with the approaching low-pressure area will cause the occurrence of severe convulsions in the large part of the South West.
In the local areas 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous rainwaters, cloud bubbles and possible cracks in the desert.
The deep layer of tropical rain will cause the occurrence of an apocalypse that will weigh between 50 and 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Even 25 to 100 mm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially above the larger part of Arizona.
It is possible that spring floods with rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to leave in the desert because of the danger of tropical storms.
A strong rain could turn canyons into divided rivers, and the pellets with grueling will bring local storm winds and dust vijac.
Approaching the low pressure area will bring local heavy rains on the parts of southern California.
The surfaces are possible in a quantity of more than 12 mm, which can cause less cloudy holes and skeletal roads.
It will be the first round in the spring season in this region.
The scattered tropical raindrops will start approaching Arizona on Sunday afternoon and Monday early morning before the end of Monday and on Tuesday cover the wide area.
The heavy rain will spread on Tuesday in the area where the borders of the associated states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah will be reached and will last all day on Wednesday.
In November, there are possible major changes in temperature across the United States as the Arctic colds, but tropical parts will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature in small distances.
Sunday is a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City in Missouri, Omega in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days the summer heat will continue to grow and grow again.
It is expected that in most of the Central and Eastern United States, the beginning of November will be warm from 27 degrees south to the parts of the Northeast.
New York City could get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows the large possibility of excessive temperatures on the east of the US during the first half of November.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing of Bretta Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the testimony of candidates for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assaults that had reportedly occurred in the '80s.
In the meantime, the political report continued, and the reporters interrupted the regular programme to report on the shift at the last minute of the Friday: agreement reached by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona that the FBI will conduct a single investigation.
Ford told the Senate court that she was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh was in a drunk condition and tried to take her clothes off at the high school party.
Kavanaugh said in the burning witness that he was absolutely sure that didn't happen.
The hearing on Friday was probably followed by more than 20.4 million people, the number mentioned in the Nielsen report.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no immediate number of viewers for other networks that transmitted the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And the company Nielsen usually has difficulties with measuring the number of people looking at the content in the devices.
To help you do this better, it's about a publication that's like a number of those who look at playing American football or Oscar's fate.
Fox News Channel, whose guests in the study strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the largest number of viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the entire day's hearing, were contacted by Nielsen.
ABC took another location with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained much after the hearing.
Flake had a central role in the drama that took place on Friday.
After the office of that moderate Republican minister issued a statement that they would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN cameras and CBS were filming on it loud demonstrators on Friday morning while trying to lift the lift to the hearing of the Justice Committee.
A few minutes stood in front of CNN's cameras while the demonstrators surrounded the victims.
"I stand here before you," said one woman.
“Do you think this country is telling the truth?”
They said to him: "You have power while such women are helpless."
Blake said his office had published a statement before the elevator door closed to say more about the committee's hearing.
A few hours later, all cable and television networks were alive when the Justice Committee had to vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh to vote throughout the Senate.
But Flake said he would do this only on condition that the FBI investigate complaints against candidates during the next week, which required democracies who were in the minority.
Flakea partially confirmed conversations with a friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons, and then a few more senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened the FBI's investigation against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview for Sunday Times Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of his EU exit plan to "play politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermine national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived on 29 September 2018 at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham in the United Kingdom.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, in another interview with her in the same issue on the headline, continued to criticise her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal is that the United Kingdom and the EU should pay to each other customs duties "full of stupidity".
The murder of Wade Sims: The police arrested Dyteon Simpson of the suspect for the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect for killing a fire weapon by Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU treasurer.
Dyteon Simpson (20) was arrested and held in custody under the charge of murder from the dock, reported to the police department Baton Rouge.
Officials published a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost face in the conflict.
The police found eyes on the crime scene and reported that they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports WAFB, CBS.
After Simpson's investigation, the police reported that he admitted he shot Wade and killed him.
He's asked for $350,000.
The Bureau of the Mortgage General of East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death is a bullet wound wound through the neck.
The police department thanks the working group for the escape of the federal police of Louisiana, the criminalist laboratory of the federal state police, the Southern University police and the citizens of this area for the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's sports director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement bodies for "skilling and searching for the truth."
Sims was 20 years old.
The player on the wing raised 183 cm in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played the LSU basketball.
On average, he had 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps after the game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was "expected" and "in shock" because of Wade's death.
"That's what we always worry about," said Wade.
Vulcan emits a flood in Mexico City
Pepeo that emits the volcano Popocatapetl reached southern parts of Mexico's capital city.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre of Saturday warned the Mexicans not to approach the volcano after increased crater activity and recorded 183 gas and dust emissions within 24 hours.
The center was following multiple tension and support.
Social media photos showed the tanks of the ashes on the windscreens of cars in the squares of Mexico City like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists observe an increased activity of volcanic activity, which is 72 kilometres south of the capital since the magnitude 7.1 earthquake in 2017 in central Mexico.
Vulcan known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists dispute the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the protesters protested independence against the intervention police and after thousands of people joined in protest demonstrations to mark a catalytic polarising polling vote on kidnapping.
A group of mascot separatists who were prevented by the intervention police began to beat police with eggs and paints in the dust, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that would otherwise be flooded by tourists.
The fighters were fired and later during the day when the police used fires to calm the fighter.
Within a few hours, groups claiming independence were scanning "There is no memory, no forgiveness", and the Unionists called "Long Life in Spain".
Forty-four people were admitted to the hospital because of the mild injuries suffered during the demonstration, local pressure was common.
The tensions in the region that were hard to deal with did not reach a year after the referendum of 1 November that Madrid declared protuzaconittim and which the Catholics were separatists celebrated.
A large majority of voters decided to rely on independence, although the outcome was small because those who objected mainly to the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people have been injured in severe conflicts last year after the police tried to stop voting in voting sites throughout the region.
Groups complaining about independence spent five nights on the street in order to prevent demonstrations in a sign of support from the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but the demonstrators were forced to move on with the other route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who repeated the demonstrations by separatists together with his wife said that he no longer hoped that Catalonia would gain independence.
"We have experienced one of the best moments of the past year.
I watched my parents pay for the luck they could vote, but now we're burning up," he said.
Despite having achieved the key, despite the close victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have been able to hold back this year because they are the most famous leaders in the self-defense exile or in the detention in which they are awaiting trial because of their role in organizing a referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed demonstrations on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict caused politicians both sides.
"The situation is all tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been investigating prison since the end of last year, announced that they will apply for elections for the European Parliament next year.
"Candidacy for the European elections is the best way to recognize the regression of democratic values and the repression we experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men after killing a car in the house
Three men in the age of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after they had been killed several times in Londonderry's house.
The incident occurred on Thursday about 19.30 BST in Ballynagard Crescent.
Det. Insp. Bob Blemmings said they were damaged by the door and the building itself.
It's possible that at some point on the car, there's a gun fired from the plane.
Pogodak Menge gave Livingston victory over Rangers with a score of 1:0
The first goal of Dolly Menge for Livingston has won
The new Scottish Premiership league Livingston surprised Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to confess his second defeat from the 18th to the head of the Ibrox Stadium club.
The Dolly Menge hit a decision while the boy Gary Holt dealt with the Hebrews in a second.
Gerard's boy is still in no way winning guests in Premiership this season, and the next Saturday they're playing against Hearts, the leading club in the league with which eight points remain.
Before that, Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna Club within the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, in the meantime, has increased his score in six games, and Chief Coach Holt hasn't survived the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against dead guests
Holt's boy had to run before they got that shot, given that their direct attack caused a series of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried, but he was stuck on the way to the blue, and then Alan Lithgow could only lead the ball a little further after he pulled out to hit Craig Halkett's head to the blue.
Hosts are happy to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they can cause difficulties for guests
And that's how the key goal has been achieved.
The Rangers failed to stop the free strike, and Livingston invented an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson accompanying Mengi who fell into the middle of the hole.
By that time, Rangers had control of the ball, but they were faced with an infamous domestic defense, so the Golman Liam Kelly had nothing to do with it.
It continued in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the strike.
The legs of the Rangers Allan McGregor prevented Scott Pittman, and Lithgow led a wide-ranging attack from another organised hit on Livingstone.
Long additions failed to prevent the whole line of Livingstone, and no two of them were injured – after Halket's confrontation with replace player Glen Middleton and one to play hand.
"Great" from Livingstone – analysis
Alasdar Lamont from Scotland's BBC in Areni Tony Macaroni
It's a great game and the result of Livingstone.
All up to one was perfect, which they continued to overcome the expectations of that entrance trip.
Their style of games and staff hardly changed from their return to the big clubs, but a great reward goes to Holt and the way he united the team from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great at the head of a well-organized defence, and Menga didn't allow Connor Goldson and Joe Worral to have a run-in during the entire game.
But Rangers didn't have any inspiration.
They were far from the standards that set a good game under Gerard.
They couldn't hit the ball to the end. They just opened a hole in the house, and that's their own call to trade for Rangers, who's in the middle of the night.
Erdogan expected with mixed feelings in Koelna
On Saturday (June 29th) everything was a lot of laughter under the sky when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan Germany – whose aim is to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have developed opinions on issues involving human rights, freedom of print and access to the EU of Turkey.
Erdogan then headed to Coeln to open a huge new gym.
There is the largest Turkish population living outside Turkey in that city.
For security reasons, the police blocked the mass collection of 25,000 people in front of the jemmies, but a large number of presidential accessions that had come to see him appeared nearby.
And hundreds of demonstrators of Erdogan – a large number of Kurds – voted in favour of Erdogan's policy and the German government's decisions to welcome him to the country.
Conflicted demonstrations reflect the division that causes a visitor to be praised by some German Turks as heroes, while others attack as autocrats.
On the way to Deptford: the bikelist died in a car crash
Bikelist was killed in a car crash in London.
Sodar happened near the intersections of Bestwood and Evelyn Street, on the road with a nice traffic in Deptford in the south of the city about 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and emergency assistance arrived, but the man moved on to the spot.
A few months after the death of another biker and a driver from an accident site in the Chiders Street, about a mile away, and half of a Saturday accident.
City police have reported that police officers are trying to identify a man and inform his closest family.
Unfortunately, the roads are closed and bus traffic is redirected, and motor vehicle drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers injured in riots
From prison, the authorities reported that six police officers were injured in a man's prison.
The unrest broke out in Long Martin prison in Worcestershire about 09:30 BST a week and still lasts.
Special "Tornado" campaigns have been carried out to combat tensions involving eight prisoners and are limited to one wing.
Police officers on the face have been assisted by minor injuries.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “A specially trained prison staff has been engaged in resolving the incident during the Long Lartin prison.
Six members of staff were helped because of the injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and we want to make it clear that all of us will be responsible for the police and that we can spend a long time behind the rescue."
There are more than 500 inmates in the Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the prison manager ended up in the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in November last year, the intervention police were invited to prison to resolve the serious situation in which the personnel were attacked by billiard bullets.
Uragan Rosa to prevent Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City from rainwater (may be useful for dry areas)
The rare thing is that tropical depression strikes Arizona, but there is a likelihood that it will just happen in the beginning of the next week when Uragan Rosa is exerting the rest of his power over the Desert South West and endangers the rainwaters.
The National Hydrometeriological Service has already issued warnings of spring rains for Monday and Tuesday in the West Arizona, across southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should approach Phoenix late Monday with the rain and walk right through it on Tuesday.
The National Hydrometeriological Service in Phoenix in its tweet stated that “from 1950 onwards, only ten trops of cyclone caused tropical storms or depression within 200 miles [320 km] of Phoenix!
Uragan Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The most recent model of the National Centre for Uraganas foresees 50 to 100 mm oborine, with an isolated quantity of up to 150 mm on the Mogollon River Arizona.
In the other areas of the Desert South West, including the Wallyak and the Great Base, there is the probability of a 25 to 50 mm hole, with possible isolated total quantity up to 100 mm.
For those beyond the dangers of the Rosa pines, it could come as a rescue because the region is hit by drought.
Although floods are a great danger, part of these areas could be useful because the drought government is currently in the southwestern part of the country.
"According to the American map of dry areas, some 40 percent of Arizona has been hit by at least extreme dry, second highest category," published weather.com
The journey of hurricanes first approached the coast along the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the force of hurricanes with a maximum wind speed of 130 km per hour and found 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moved north at 20 km per hour.
The oil was found on the colder Pacific waters and thus weakened.
Therefore, it is expected that on Monday afternoon or evening the Gulf of Mexico will be approached by the forces of tropical storm.
The rain in parts of Mexico could be strong and represent a significant risk of flooding.
"The number of total surfaces expected in the area from the Bay of California to the north-west of the Sonore is 75 to 150 mm, possibly 250 mm," declared weather.com.
Rosa will then go north through Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression that will then pass through Arizona and in southern Utah until Tuesday late evening.
"The main danger expected by Rose or the rest of her remains is very strong rain on the peninsula of Baja California, on the northwestern of Sonore and in the American Desert Southwest," they reported from the National Centre for Uregans.
It is expected that the rain will cause you to experience life-threatening rainwaters and mud bubbles in the deserts and mountain cliffs.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-olds were arrested for suspects of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man with fatal wounds was found in Somerset.
About 04.00 BST on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton was found a wounded teenager.
He was taken to the hospital and stable.
Avona and Somerset police authorities reported that they were 17 years old, 2 18 years old, and 20-year-olds were arrested during the night in Radstock.
Police officers have called to report to everyone who has a video of the event.
The trumpet claims that Kavanaugh has suffered violence and anger from Democratic parties
"The voice of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for the rejection of cruel and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a pre-election meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
The Tromp stated that Kavanaugh "ended evil and anger" by the Democratic Party during the nomination procedure.
Kavanaugh testified on Thursday before Congress and strongly and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault attack more than ten years ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford witnessed hearing of the charges she made.
On Saturday, the president said that that day "the American people saw the brightness, quality and courage" in Kavanaugh.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh's voice is to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with a non-permanent career in public service," said the authorities in West Virginia.
The president touched Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of the Republican election to half the presidential mandate.
"Five weeks have shared us with one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm actually," he said.
That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
The trumpet claimed that the mission of democracy was to "increase opposition and opposition".
The Assistant Director of the Republican leadership announced to CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh was expected at the latest on Friday.
Hundreds of deaths in Indonesian earthquake and tsunamis, and the number continues to grow
The governing body announced on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, from which a large number of them were taken by huge waves that hit the coast when the great earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at the festival on the beach in the city of Pala on Friday when they struck at the peak of a height of up to six meters, pulling many of them to death and destroying everything on their way.
Cunami succeeded after the magnitude 7.5 collapse.
"When yesterday danger from tsunamis appeared, people were still on the beach and they didn't immediately seek and lost," Sutop Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian agency to mitigate the consequences of the BNPB disaster at a press conference in Jakarti.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he was driving cars, fats, homes, he hit everything on the ground," Nugro said, adding that the tsunamis crossed open sea at 800 km/h before he hit the coast.
"Some people went to the stairs to escape the tsunami and survive," he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the disaster agency show the number of destroyed buildings and shops, hidden and destroyed bridges, and the jemmies surrounded by water.
The night strike continued to strike that coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) announced in its report that the energy released by the Great Depression on Friday was equivalent to the bilateral nuclear bomb power dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It suggests that the geographical location of the city, located at the end of the long and dry season, may have increased the strength of tsunamis.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the destruction of the building and added that 540 people were injured, and 29 were considered missing.
According to Nugro's words, the number of victims and damages may be greater than 300 km north of Palu, in the area called Dondrea, which is near the epicenter of the earthquake.
"Communications are completely interrupted and we have no information from Dongry."
"More than 300,000 people live in this area," says the Red Cross report, adding that staff and volunteers have moved to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could be much worse," said the report.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism for not providing information that the tsunami struck Palu, although officials claim that the waves had arrived at the moment the warning was issued.
In a amateur film shared on social networks, it can be felt that a man on the top of a building suddenly warns people down on the street about the coming tsunami.
Within a few minutes, a water wall was encountered on the coast, carrying a building and a car.
The Reuters agency could not verify the authenticity of the video immediately.
The floods and tsunamis have caused a lack of electricity that has caused the interruption of communication around Palu, which has made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue action.
According to the authorities, it has started sending cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but it is still necessary for refugees to get food and other necessities.
The city airport is reopened only for humanitarian activities and will remain closed until November.
President Joko Vidodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Saturday.
The tsunamis in Indonesia cost more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
"Although the staff of the World Vision from Dondree successfully arrived in the city of Palau where employees were placed in the tarpaulin tent in the court of their offices, they followed the scenes of destruction on the way," said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw a number of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have launched disaster relief aid, some have complained that the arrival of foreign humanitarians with great expertise is impossible in Pala.
According to Indonesian funding, supply and commitment requirements from other countries can only begin if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the level of the province," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government says 'OK, it's a national disaster' we can receive international assistance, but such a situation has not yet been announced."
When it fell on Pala the second night after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of those still considered missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be one of those miracles that slow down the black scenarios of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was rescued from the canal.
On Saturday, rescuers released a woman who had been imprisoned for two days in chains near her mother's body.
Gendon Subbandon, a trainer of the Indonesian state paraglider team, trained two missing pairs for Asian games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those prisoners at Roa Roa's hotel, including Petra Mandage, were his students.
"In view of the many years spent in the paradigm, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled that after news of the destruction of Roa Roa's hotel, which expanded to the paraglideric community, he sent a message to the contestants from Palu who participated in the festival on the beach.
But his messages are still marked by a gray flower, instead of two blue flowers.
"I think it means that messages are not delivered," he said.
The thieves took $26,750 from the US dollar while filling the banks in the center of Newport on the Level
The thieves stole 26,750 US dollars from Brink's employee, who was filling up the bankats at the centre of Newport on the Level, in the press release of Newport police.
In a statement by Detective Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the car was empty in the entertainment complex and prepared to fill it with a new amount of money.
While the team was busy, the other man "came to the Brink's staff behind the back" and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be put in the bank.
The Witnesses noticed more suspects running away from the theft scene, but the police did not indicate the number of persons involved in the incident.
All who have any information about their identity should contact the police in Newport on number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: raper my exchange in Ye
Raper Kanye West will change his name in Ye.
In the Sunday post on Twitter, in which he announced the change, he wrote: “Life will be officially known as Kanye West."
West (41) has the title Ye for some time and has used it as the title of its eight album published in June.
The change comes in the eyes of his guests at the Saturday Night Live show, which is expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
Emission authors said that the show replaced the singer Arian Grande, who rejected him for “emotional reasons”.
Except for the shortness of his current artistic name, West has previously stated that this word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ti'," said West earlier this year in a discussion on the title of his album with Radio Director Big Boye.
"So, it's me, it's me, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means "one", in only Ye – it's a reflection of good, bad, confused, everything in us.
The album itself is actually a reflection of who we are."
He's one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but he announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
And once West's associate, JAY-Z, was playing with versions of his name without drawing and with a drawing and written with great words.
Mexico's AMLO promised he won't use the army against the citizens.
The candidate for Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use the military force against citizens as the country nears the 50th anniversary of the bloodshed of the students.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday promised on the Tlatelolco market that "he will never use the army against the Mexican people."
The military forces fired during the peaceful demonstration on that market on 2 November 1968 and killed even 300 people at the moment when left-wing students began to spread to Latin America.
Lopez Obrador committed to supporting young Mexicans by providing monthly support to those studying and opening up a large number of free public schools.
He said that unemployment and lack of education attract young criminal gangs.
The US should double investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
"As China becomes more and more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its investment in research in this area," said an investor in artistic intelligence and expert in the Kai Fu Leee area that worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment followed after various parts of the American government announced plans for artificial intelligence, although the US is in principle missing a formal strategy on artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China has presented its plan for the past year: its goal is to become the first country by the number of AI innovations by 2030.
"The double increase in the budget for research in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are far away from the US and that we are looking for the next great discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"The double increase in investment could double the chances that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will come to the US," Lee said this week in a CNBC discussion.
Lee whose book is "AI grande: China, the Silicon Valley and the new world leader" published this month by the publishing house Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, the principal director of the Sinovation Ventures company that invests in one of the most important AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, the last century at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on the AI system that won the best American player game Othello, and later he was director at Microsoft's Research Department and President of the Google Chinese Border.
Lee praised the previous technological competition of the American government, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when to continue to find new visionaries.
According to Lee's words, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
"It's not China that drives academic leaders, it's corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have engaged the most brightest bids from universities to work on researching artificial intelligence over the past few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policies could also help the United States to influence its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that doctors in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically offer green cards," he said.
The Chinese State Council announced the Plan for the Development of Art Intelligence Next Generation in July 2017.
"The Chinese National Science Foundation provides financial resources to individuals in academic institutions as the National Science Foundation and other state organisations provide financial resources to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China," Lee said.
Earlier this year the US Ministry of Defence established the Community Centre for Art Intelligence, which aims to include partners from the activities and academic community, and White House announced the establishment of the Committee on Art Intelligence.
This month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
When it comes to NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, the American legislation that wanted to establish the National Security Commission on Art Intelligence is no longer a burden for months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on changing their country's names
The Macedonian citizens voted in the referendum on Saturday whether they would want to change their country's name in the "Northern Republic of Macedonia". This is a move that could resolve the dispute with Greece that has been taking place for several decades, and why Greece has blocked the opening of negotiations for accession to the European Union and NATO.
In Greece, there is a province called Macedonia and Greece claiming that its northern neighbour's name represents its territory and has placed a veto on the entry of the country into NATO and the EU.
Two governments in June agreed on a proposed new name, but the nationalist opponents claim that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote on the referendum, and the campaign to fight the vote raised doubts as to whether the outcome would meet the minimum 50 per cent required to be relevant to the referendum.
The question on the referendum vote list was, "Are you going to join NATO and the EU with the adoption of a agreement with Greece?"
Representatives of the change of names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, claim that it was a price worth paying to pay for Macedonia, one of the countries that continued after the breakup of Yugoslavia, allowing access to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for Macedonia's young people, so that they can live freely under the European Union's roof because that means a safer life for all of us," said Oliver Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although the voting result is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament said they would respect him in order to be considered decisive.
Change of names requires a bilateral majority in parliament.
The State electoral authority has stated that no irregularities have been reported until 13 hours.
However, the output was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a spokesman from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško, joined the referendum on 30 September 2018 on the change in country names, which would open the way to joining NATO and the European Union.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov in front of the Parliament in Skopje placed a little attention and placed chairs in front of the tent that those who were exaggerating the referendum had set up.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join raised heads, not as servants," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor countries, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO would make so much needed investments in Macedonia, the country in which unemployment rates exceed 20 per cent.
"I believe that the majority will support the referendum, since more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the "positive" result would represent "the certainty of our future".
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 and 43% of voters will join the referendum, which is subject to the necessary response.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said it would support the referendum.
For the referendum to succeed, the output must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to Western government policies since it took over its mandate in May last year.
Look: Player Manchester City Sergio Aguero passes through the entire Bridgeton defense to win the hit
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, broke Brighton's defense and won for Manchester City with the result 2 :0.
Aguero made the victory a simple, easy hit in 65 minutes.
Argentinian attacker received an addition to the middle ground at the beginning of the attack.
He broke through three Brighton's defense players and then got to the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four opposite players in green shirts.
He wore one of the armory, and then he pushed them a few more on the bridge of Brighton.
Then he added the ball to Starling.
The English attacker from the first attempt returned the Aguere ball to the right-wing ball to the right-hand side of the network and wounded Brighton's backer Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some difficulties with the foot," the journalist reported manager Manchester City, Pep Guardian.
"We planned to play a game of 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're happy he's been hit at that moment."
But Sterling was the one Sky Blues gave the initial priority in the Premier League.
That shot was achieved in 29 minutes.
Aguero got deep in Brighton's field during this game.
He gave Leroy Sane the ball on the left side.
Sane beat the ball a few times before Sterling was introduced to the station.
The Sky Blues attacker threw the ball into the net before breaking into the car.
Manchester City is fighting against the Hoffeneheims in the team game League trial on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. on the Rhine-Neckar-Arena Stadium in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to disable Rockie's progress.
Since the Nationals players were eliminated from playing, there was not much reason to insist on the new start.
But always competitive Scherzer hopes to win Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockiesi, who have the advantage of a game over Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of the West, win the game.
On Friday evening, the Rockies won from 5:2 over the Nationals at least secure a place in the wild-card playing, but they hope to win their first title.
"Although we did not play for anything, we could at least throw up knowing what the atmosphere is here in Denver with a multitude of fans, and the other team would play at the highest level I would witness this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete with that?"
The nationals still have to publish a Sunday starter, but they're obviously willing to offer Scherzer to play.
Scherzer, who's going to make his 34th start, burned himself in the fireplace on Thursday and will play Sunday when he's usually resting.
The right from Washington in this season has achieved the result of 18 : 7, the range of winning race (ERA) from 2,53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 double-tier exchanges.
A trumpet in West Virginia
The president, while speaking about the importance of Republican voters' exits at the general election, commented briefly on his selection of Bretta Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court judge.
"All we've done will be at the studio.
It's five more weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are one of the great, great – I didn't apply, but I'm actually in the race and that's why I'm everywhere to fight for great candidates," he said.
The trumpet continues: “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democracy, you see that is happening right now.
Their intention is to retake power in any way; see crime, corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to pass over to take over power and control, so they want power and control, and we won't give them."
Democrats, as he says, have a mission to "response and avoid".
"You've seen it during the last four days," he said, so-called Democrats "heavy, evil, corrupt and lying."
He spoke to democratic senator Diane Feinstein of the Senate Justice Committee on behalf of the Senate, which led to a loud rejection of the public.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leave the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the document - it was really a bad body speech, the worst body speech I've ever seen."
The Laburist Party no longer takes into account different opinions.
It does not tolerate exposure to personal substances
I wasn't too surprised when Moment's activists in my local side voted to censor me.
Finally, I'm the last of the representatives of the Laburist Party who were told they didn't welcome – all because of what we told us.
According to my colleague Joan Ryan, they took a similar approach because they strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics that Jeremy Corbyn did not agree with the previous leadership.
The report on the meeting of the Laburist Party of Nottingham on Friday stated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight years during which I work as a local representative of the Laburist Party, the meetings of the Main Council on Friday evening were just like that.
Unfortunately, many of today's meetings are being held in a different tone, and the promise of a "lover, lower" policy has long been forgotten, if it ever started.
It has become even more evident that different views do not tolerate in the Laburist Party, and every opinion is assessed on the basis of whether that acceptable foreign leadership is.
It began soon after Jeremy became leader, since the co-operatives I thought we shared a similar political opinion from me began to demand a radical change of opinion and taking up a position I would never have agreed with otherwise – whether it was about national security or the single EU market.
Whenever I talk to the public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – it’s following a bunch of hurtful words on social networks that my opposition is facing, which reject the centre’s policy and tell me that I shouldn’t be a member of the Laburist Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know I've had more happiness than some of my colleagues because they're comments that are directed to me mainly politically.
I admire the professionality and the decisions of my colleague who are faced with daily sexist or racist comments, but they never give up.
One of the aspects of this political era that has most disappointed me is the tolerance of hurtful speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Laburist Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality tells us that we no longer take different views into account and that with every proposal on distrust or change of election rules, we become more and more relevant parties.
Many times in the last two years, they advised me to raise my head, not to be so loud, and they told me that then everything would be all right."
But I didn't do it in politics.
Since I joined the Laburist Party 32 years ago, motivated by the neglect of the government, Margaret Thatcher, who left my school university university student school, I wanted to provide better public services for those who need them most — whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, nor in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham's border could have been led to a misunderstanding with regard to my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I would like to send to those who have supported the proposal Friday is that, at the moment that the country is playing against Brexit, which will negatively affect households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to lose time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Laburist Party.
But in fact, the only message I have for Nottingham Momentum, but for my election units, is whether it's about the members of the Laburist Party or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of opposition or political advantage will turn me away from acting as I think is in your best interest.

Ayr – Melrose: 38 : 17 uninterrupted Ayr goes to the top
Two late attempts may have actually affected the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting game of days at Tennt's Premiership League.
Now they've reached the top of the board and they're the only ones that have been unarmed by ten teams.
Finally, the upper defense and the better use of the opportunity led them to victory, and Coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tried every game for years, and we're still not broken, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christie from Melrose's club said, "Every honor to Ayru, they've used a lot better than us."
Try Grant Anderson at 14 minutes that did Frazier Climo brought Ayr into charge, but the yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, who had turned the game off Warriors, enabled Melrose to raise the results, and Jason Baggot used an unrealistic attempt.
The climate has increased the leadership of Ayra's eleven-year-olds before, in the half-year alone, he has achieved a hit and realized a self-esteem attempt to change the outcome for Ayr at 17:5 p.m.
But Melrose, in the second half, started well and tried Patrick Anderson, who realized Baggot, reduced his priority on five points.
At that time, a long stand arose because of the serious injuries of Ruaridha Knott that they carried on their noses, and when the game continued, Ayr continued to play a good game trying Stafford McDowall who realized Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson then got a yellow card and Melrose remakes an extra player to pay, and this is an unrealistic attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
A side player, however, came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to destroy Climate that had no ball; with a line for a criminal hit, MacPherson carried out a position behind Ayra in full lock of the shop.
Climo realized how he did it almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe had received a high hit from David Armstrong and sent side player Gregor Henry in fifth attempt at home boy.
Still Game Series Star seems ready for a new career in restaurant activity
Ford Kiernan, star of the Still Game series, seems ready to continue working in official activities after it has been found to be named by the director of licensed restaurants.
56-year-old player Jack Jarvis in a favorite BBC series whose scenario is one of the stars, along with a long-term partner in comedys, Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the next nine seasons would be the last to be shown, and Kiernan seems to be planning to dedicate his life after Craiglunga.
According to the official record, he is the Director of the Company of Agymorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although one source for the Scottish Sun insisted that Kiernan would be involved in the "increasing restaurant activity in Glasgow".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no way to go to the sea, hopes that the court will assign her exit to the Pacific Ocean
Marines patrol the marine center full of dilats in La Paz.
The ocean color flag is reported on public buildings.
The sea basins from Lake Titicaca to Amazon or from the cry: “We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to bring it back."
Throughout Bolivia, without access to the sea, the memory of Chile's lost marine coast in the face of a conflict in the 19th century is still alive – just as is the case with the refishing of the Pacific.
While Bolivia is awaiting the judgement of the International Court of Justice expected on 1 November, following a five-year procedure, hope may be at the highest level in the last few decades.
"Bolivia has a moment, a spirit of unity and peace, of course, looks forward to the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
The majority of Bolivians across the country will look at the International Court of Justice on large screens and hope that the Hague court will decide in favour of Bolivia's position that Chile, after more than a decade of the required negotiations, will be able to negotiate on the rise of sovereign exits to the sea of Bolivia.
Here Morales, a Bolivian charismatic autoethnic president who is facing a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, can also benefit from Monday's trial.
"We're paying back the Pacific," he promised at the end of the cologne.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will judge the benefit of Bolivia and that this would change little if it were.
The UN body sitting in the Netherlands has no authority to share Chilean territory and said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice is coming all six months after the final hearing means that the case was "not written", said Paz Zarate, Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's interests, the last four years may have been delayed.
"The question of access to the sea has now been adopted by the Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales' war rector has buried every good will of Chile, he thinks.
Bolivia and Chile will continue dialogue for a moment, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
These two countries have not been replaced by ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, a Bolivian representative in Haagu, disagrees with the fact that the court has made an unusual decision.
Monday, Bolivia will bring "an unprecedented opportunity to start a new period in relation to Chile" and the opportunity to "cut off 139 years of incompatibility with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – used the maritime issue as a political stock.
"Bolivia will never deny the right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The trial is an opportunity to see that we need to transform the past."
North Korea said she wouldn't come to nuclear disarmament if she couldn't trust the US.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be nuclear-disarmed if they could not trust Washington.
Ri approached the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises of days during the meeting of the leaders of these two opposing countries in Singapore.
The comments were made at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed to have recently reopened diplomatic talks on nuclear issues, which came more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Unom.
Ri says the sanctions have continued because of the "loss of imagination" and that opposition to the US declaration on the end of the Korean war will not rather leave the North on the knees.
Washington is not willing to support the declaration without Pjongjang taking concrete steps to disarm it first.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold another meeting at the top.
But it is widely attended by a scepticism about the serious intention of Pjongjanga to withdraw the arsenic that the country is likely to see as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongjang next month to prepare for the second meeting of Kima and Trump.
Paris’ fashion magazines reveal that the last line of big envelopes is on the way to luxury trade in your neighborhood
If you want to advance your collection of hats or completely lock the sun, do not continue.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented the line of abandoned grotesques for their spring and summer collection in 2019 and encouraged the style lovers in the Paris weekly fashion.
These extremely ineffective six were the summer of Instagram, and these designers sent their creations that drew attention to the writing.
The example he had in mind was Valentino, and it's about a large six-six-pounded wide area like the pearl that "takes" the head of the model.
The rest of the glazing supplements included the beads, the magic hat, and even the pineapples, but these supplements aren't meant to shake your head.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of strange masks – at the time of the Night of the Witch.
Many of the scars of the masks had their lips covered and made Hannibal Lecter more than a piece of high fashion.
One was created with a wheelchair and a mask, and the other looked like a cornet with heated ice cream.
If you follow a great fashionable saying, happiness is on your side.
The stylists predict that huge caps could come into luxury shops in your neighborhood.
The huge six are perfectly compatible with the "La Bomba", a slender hat with a width of about 60 cm, which is seen on many famous and famous people, from Rihanne to Emily Rattakowski.
The cultural slave market behind the extremely ineffective hat that has broken down the social networks on the fashion screen has sent another great creation – a silver-red bag almost as much as a manganese in the buyer's costume.
Sagasito orange bag of raffia, decorated with raffia and white leather gloves, was an example in the 2019 Jacquemus' La Riviera summer collection in the Paris weekly fashion.
The famous and famous stylist Luke Armitage told the FEMAIL: "I expect big beach hats and bags in luxury shops for the next year. Since the designer left such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for big blue supplements."
John Edward: Language skills that citizens of the world need
The Scottish independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which has continued in 2018 with another package of outstanding results, and the additional weight of this gives individual and common success in sports, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools representing the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS) are trying to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools have the goal of preparing students for further education and higher education, a career that they want to do and make for citizens of the world.
As a educational sector that can design and implement those school curriculums, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you turn to a man who understands the language, it goes into his head.
If you turn to his mother tongue, it goes into his heart."
This statement is a powerful reminder that we can’t use only English if we want to build trust and relations with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year's final exams show that the highest estimates in languages have reached the dropouts of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have taught foreign languages received excellent assessments.
The data collected at 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received a positive assessment in Mandarin, while 72% of students studying German, 69% studying French and 63% of students studying Spanish also received the highest possible assessment.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Today, languages as election items are considered as important as STEM objects (knowledge, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the cycle of independent schools, as well as elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the United Kingdom Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17% of employers cannot fill jobs due to lack of labour force with language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly imperatives for the preparation of young people for careers.
Since there is a need for knowledge of language at all places of work, skills are key in a globalized world.
Regardless of the choice of careers, those who have learned to speak a foreign language in the future will feel the benefits of such long - term skills.
A person who speaks more languages can directly communicate with strangers, and this gives her the advantage in relation to competition.
According to a survey by the Organisation of YouGov, involving more than 4,000 adults in 2013, 75% of respondents in the United Kingdom do not know the foreign language well enough to communicate with it, and French is the only language that speaks a bilingual percentage of respondents, 15% of them.
So investing in language learning is very important to children today.
If children learn more languages, especially the languages of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find a good job.
Every school in Scotland offers different languages.
Some schools will include classic, modern languages in their programmes, while others will decide for languages that are considered to be the most important in the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, in independent schools, there will always be a variety of choices, as well as educational staff who are skilled in this area.
Scottish independent schools enable children to learn to prepare and equip their skills for success regardless of what the future holds for us.
It cannot be ignored that in today’s global business, language knowledge is very important to the future of each country, so that it must also be reflected in education.
Thus, the knowledge of modern languages should certainly be seen as "International communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer the choice of language, diversity and excellence to young Scottishs.
You need to do it.

LeBron will first shine in Lakers' dress on Sunday in San Diego.
The winner will soon wait for LeBron James for Lakers from Los Angeles.
Trainer Lakers Luke Walton said James will play in the first pre-session match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he doesn't know how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one and less than 48 minutes," said Walton to the Lakers official.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell posted a tweet that James probably won't play the whole game.
After training this week James responded to questions about his plans for the presidential team in Lakers, which consists of six games.
"In this phase of career I really don't need pre-season games," he said.
Trump maintains a collection in West Virginia, a YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts the campaign with numerous groups in Wheeling in West Virginia tonight.
This is the first of five planned groups to be held next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet voted for a new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for future elections because there is a risk that the Republicans will lose most of the Congress after voting in the student.
How many hours does the Tromp's collection in West Virginia start and how can you look at it online?
The Trompo assembly in Wheeling in West Virginia is scheduled for 19 hours after the east time, tonight, on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
Trump's collection in West Virginia can be viewed online via streams live on YouTube.
The trumpet will probably comment on this week's hearing of the Judge of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh, who raised complaints of sexual abuse. The Senate's firm decision to wait is already a week before the FBI's investigation.
But the primary objective of this group is to help the Republicans achieve the choice of students.
As a result, Trumpo's chairman of the presidential campaign reports that five groups banned for the next week have "stimulate volunteers and consents because the Republicans are trying to maintain and increase the majority of the people in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
"Most of the Congress is so important to Presidents' plans that they will travel to what more countries as we enter the burn-up campaign," said Reuters anonymous speaker of the Trump campaign.
The evening gathering that will be held in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract accessions from "Ohija and Pennsylvania, as well as the media from Pittsburgh", reports West Virginia Metro News.
The trumpet will visit West Virginia on Saturday the second time in the past month. In 2016, it won over 40 percent points.
The trumpet is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey from West Virginia, who remains in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must help him improve his level of research," politician Simon Haedar from the University of West Virginia told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018.: The US team left hearts on the ground before individual rounds on Sunday
After three single sessions, the couple's breaking up on Sunday afternoon may be exactly what was supposed to turn Ryder Cup.
"Court of luck is turning around" is a term that is especially valuable in sports and which athletes believe in, especially in competitions like this.
Who's the lucky bike now?
"They had six points of advantage, and now they have four. So, I think happiness is currently on our side," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europeans are in favour of four points, while there are still 12 points to the end of the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in the back and encouragement of his game in pairs with Justin Thomas, with which he won three out of four points after the entire day of the game.
Spieth played murder from tea to grass and can serve as an example to others.
The cheerleaders became more and more vocal when Spieth and Thomas came to two points of stay, and everything culminated in the key path that Spieth came to an unsolved outcome.
After the path he won the game with 15 holes, he followed a similar navigable track in which hope can be recognized and faith that Americans can all turn around.
"You just need to concentrate and think about your game," Spieth said.
The team's just left it for players now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players who won more points than Spietha and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup sensation.
The European wonder, but the undecided couple has a maximum number of points and can't make mistakes.
"Molywood" was the only couple who didn't lose the score on Saturday afternoon, but also escaped bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, as well as back nine on Friday morning.
This victory line, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinaria, shows that they are exactly the players to win on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two of them who can guarantee the victory of the Europeans as the sun falls on the Paris Le Golf National.
Maybe both will bring victory at the same time on different holes.
But it's too early to talk about Europe's victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly arranged Alex Noren and Sergey Garcija who had a great performance in the morning pair game.
One bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes in the playground buried Spain and Sweden in the hole they failed to dig out.
However, on Sunday there will be no one who will help individuals get out of their hole.
It is fascinating to look at the pair games nearby because you can see the interaction of players in a couple, hear the advice they give and those who do not give, as well as explore a strategy that can change at the moment.
Europeans have already played better as a team, and on the last day it comes with a significant priority, but this game in pairs has also shown that the US team has the necessary fight, in which some, especially the stateside, have doubted.
Europeans on the last day of Ryder Cup come with leadership from 10 : 6
Europeans after Saturday's games in pairs on the last day of Ryder Cup come in with a significant prelude over the US from 10 : 6.
The dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, with two victories over Tiger Woods, brought four points of difference to Le Golf National.
The European boy Thomas Bjorna was trying to win the trophi that he pulled out in Hazeltine two years ago was stronger than the American boy in the morning game in the couple's couple's real results from 3:1 .
The American boy showed more struggle in pairs than two games won, but the difference in points was already great.
To win the trophy of a boy Jim Furyka, eight points should be collected in 12 individual games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first debater from the European boy who won four points in line, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood", after a sedentary weekend, only a couple who won four points in the games in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourballs, they showed themselves powerful in the game against Woods and American debater Bryson Dechambeau won from 5&4.
Woods who didn't show the best performance in two Saturday games has performed some genius moves, but now there are 19 episodes of 29 games in the Fourballs and the pairs and seven injuries in the order.
Justin Rose spent the morning's fourballs with his partner Henrik Stanson to return to play with the pairs and experience the defeat of 2&1 by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the first and third best player in the world.
But the Europeans didn't have everything to do as well as they did during a pleasant day in the southeastern part of Paris.
Trotsy winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won two points a week and thus set the flag high on their American boy.
They first injured Spanish Jona Rahma and Iana Poultera by 2&1 in the Fourballs, and then injured Poultera and Rory McCllroy with 4&3 in the pairs after the first two holes were lost.
Twice in the entire story of Ryder Cup boy, who was in the last four points, managed to get back into a single game, although Fury's boy needs only an unsolved result to keep the trophy.
After two days in the rest of the day, they seem to have a hard day's strike.
North Korea announced that "no chance" for a single non-confidential dispute
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday before the United Nations that further sanctions increase distrust in the United States and that there is no chance that North Korea will be unilaterally disarmed and abandoned of nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said in the UN General Assembly that North Korea has committed "significant measures of good will" last year, for example stopped nuclear and rocket tests, decomposed a nuclear test station and made a decision to stop the development of nuclear technology and weapons.
"However, we have not received a satisfactory response from the United States," he added.
"If we don't believe in the US, we don't believe in our national security, and under such circumstances there's no chance that we'll get one-sided."
Although Ri has reiterated the known allegations of North Korea against Washington's "progressive" approach to denuclearization that would have gradually abolished the sanctions in North Korea, his statement is significant because he has not rejected unilateral denuclearization as Pjonjang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump at the first meeting in the history of the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on "the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea wants to officially end the Korean war that lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has pledged that Pjongang will withdraw nuclear weapons before that.
Washington also ignored calls to reduce severe international sanctions for North Korea.
"The United States insists that previously denuclearization is carried out and increases pressure by means of sanctions in order to achieve its objective strictly, and even counter to the "declaration of the end of the war", Ri added.
"The perception that sanctions can cast us on our knees is only a mistake of people who don't know anything about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases distrust."
Ri has not mentioned whether there are plans for the second meeting of Kima and Trump, which the president of the United States spoke at the beginning of the week in the United Nations.
However, the minister pointed out that Kim and South Korean Chief Moon Jae-in held even three meetings in the last five months and added: "If South Korea had sought denuclearization, not the US, the Korean peninsula's denuclearization would not have come to such a stand."
Regardless of all, the tone of speech, Minister Riya's speech was much different from last year's when he spoke before the UN General Assembly and said that the target of continental US rockets was inevitable after bad President Trump called Kim a "human rocket" on a suicide mission.
The storm that warned of the "complete destruction" of North Korea last year has commended Kima for her courage to disarm, but he added that she is waiting for them much more work and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, the trumpet said there was no time frame for denuclearization and added: “It doesn’t matter whether it will last for two years, three years or five months. ”
China and Russia expressed the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo Security Council said on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must be strictly continued until full, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions for North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to halt the financing of a nuclear and ballistic programme in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Rij in the UN headquarters and then said he would visit Pyongjang again next month for preparations for the second meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not gone well.
He left Pjongjang in July and said that he had made progress, but North Korea called him after a few hours because of "gangster demands".
North Korea has agreed with Moon this month to detonate the rocket locations and nuclear complex that will take place if the United States assumes "responsive measures".
He added that Kim discovered that these "relevant measures" relate to the security guarantee that Trump promised in Singapore and to certain steps towards stabilization of the relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard go on a course to learn how to relax well
The new course at Harvard University has enabled all students to sleep well in an attempt to fight against increasingly growing learning culture with caffeine and sleepless nights.
Academic observed that students at the world’s best universities often have no idea of the basics of concern for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist in Brigham and Women's Hospital, invented a course that he considered to be the first class in the United States.
He came up with an idea of the course after he kept talking about the effect of depressive sleep on learning.
At the end of the class, one girl came to me and said: “Why did I find this out just now, at last year’s college? ”
She said no one told her how important the dream was, which surprised me," he said for The Telegraph.
The course that is held for the first time this year explains to students how good sleep habits help in academic and sports success and generally improve health.
Professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of Health Services, Paul Barreira University, says the University has decided to introduce a course following a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The single course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes a picture of student bedrooms where students need to click on cupcakes, candles, tennis and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how low sleep affects success and how important sleep routine is.
Students also learn how long - term sleep deficiency can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Then there is a map of the campus with interactive icons that encourages students to think about their daily routine.
"We know that student behaviour will not change immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in lifelong learning before the study continues to exist, says professor and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that there is a lack of sleep in the larger problems.
The professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and fatigue should be a good and quality dream. Sleeping helps also in the fight against obesity because lack of sleep affects the brain, puts it in the condition of hunger and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemistry and biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler figure out the course after his lecture at Harvard's first year.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to expand the course throughout the camp.
As a next step, he plans to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study subject before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students include an alarm during sleep, as well as during waking hours. They must be aware of the harmful effects of "white light" that emits secret electronic devices, as well as LEDs that can interfere with the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston – Rangers 1 : 0: Get a gol porazione Gerarrdov
The Rangers suffered one more defeat after Dolly Menge's defeat defeated the missing defense of Steven Gerrard and ended the game of winning Livingstone with the result 1 :0.
The guy from Ibrox wanted to win the first win after the triumph in the winner and the results 4 : 1 in St. Johnstone, but the boy Gary Holt caused Gerard's second win in 18 games, so his boy now remains eight points in the Ladbroke Premiership for the leading Hearts.
Menga reached the event seven minutes ago, and the Rangers seemed to remain uninspired and didn't seem to compare the result.
While Rangers are now burning in six places, Livingston fell on the third with just one story different from the Hibernia.
It could come up with new problems for Rangers after a linear judge called Calum Spence got his head wound when he was thrown out of the distance.
Gerard made eight shifts on his shoulders and thus flew around Ayra to the semifinal of Bethfred.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livingstone set that Hearts had taken last week and would be thrilled to see his well-imagined becoming all the attempt against him.
The Rangers may have had more balls in their possession, but Livingston made more of it.
They had an opportunity for a story already two minutes after Menga was first expelled from the game that Scott Pittman opened the space to go to the golden Allan McGregor, however, the relative missed this opportunity.
The profound free strike of Keaghan Jacobs was defeated by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense officer Alan Lithgow could only follow an inaccurate attack on the back lines.
The Rangers took control at one point, but at the end of the third game they seemed to play with hope instead of confidence.
Alfredo Morelos must have thought that his judge was supposed to have sentenced him to 1st grade in 15 minutes after his trial with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not accept Columbia's request.
The Rangers were in the first half of the time successful to lead only two rounds, but former Ibrox's door to Liam Kelly was one hit by the head of Lassane Coulibaly and the hits of Ovie Ejari were not a big problem.
Although Livingstone's 34-minute break-up slowed the game, no one can slow them down.
The Rangers have again failed to use the deep Jacob's returned ball.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher added a ball to Scott Robinson that held his position and selected Mengo for the simple end of the attack.
Gerard responded during the strike and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The replacement must have had an immediate effect because the wing player added to the Morelos ball, but impressive Kelly blocked it from its lines.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to exactly the kind of game they enjoy while Lithgow and Halkett made a long hit for each other.
Holt's side could have extended leadership in the final moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide escape from the castle.
Ranger's replacement Glenn Middleton was looking for one more time since he was dating Jacobs, but Thomson and this time he turned around.
Almanah: Director of Geiger's Count
And now follows the page from our Almanah on Sunday Morning issue: June 30, 1882, 136 years ago and a few days ago ...the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hansa" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity and later developed a device known as Geiger's number.
The main challenge of science since then, Geiger's numbering has also become the main obstacle to culture, such as in the 1950's "Bells of Colorado" film where most of the scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans appeared to be incredible:
Man says, "What is it, God?"
Rogers: “It’s Geiger’s computer, and it’s used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these audiences, you can actually hear atoms responding to radioactive activity in minerals."
Evans says, “Look at this, you hear it! ”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the exception that bears his name is still alive.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" bad stations
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" bad stations and destroy them
"The vaccine teaches the immunological system to recognize bad stations as part of the treatment
The procedure includes the removal of immunological system cells from the patient and their transformation into the laboratory.
The cells are treated to "recognise" the protein that is common to many cancers and then re-enter the patient
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immunological system to recognize a bad station, ovarian cancer was withdrawn for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes the removal of the immune system from the patient, their replacement in the laboratory, so that they can "recognise" white cell called HER2, which is common to many types of cancer and re-incineration.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute for Cancer in the town of Bethesda in the federal state of Maryland said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 leads to growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovaries, lung and breast cancer," explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to removing the immune system from the patient and their “learning” to identify cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West, after visiting the show Saturday Night Live, joined in the trumpet discussion and supported it, wearing a cap with the title "Let's make America big again".
It's not good.
Kanye West was retired in a study during the Saturday Night Live show following a riot in which US President Donald Trump said he would run for the 2020 president.
After he performed his third night song called Ghost Town during which he carried a cap with the title "Let's make America big again", he continued to talk against democracy and repeated to support Trump.
"I talk to white people so often and they tell me how you like Trump, he's a racist."
Well, if I were worried about racism, I'd have been moving from America a long time ago," he said.
The Saturday Night Live show began with a satirical leap in which Matt Damon ridiculed the testimony of Britta Kavanaugh before the U.S. Senate Justice Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's claims for sexual abuse.
Although he wasn't evicted, the video of West speech on the social network was transferred by Commissioner Chris Rock.
I don't know if Rock was trying to bribe West.
Also, West regretted the public that behind his attentions had been handed over because of the hat he wore.
"They hated me behind the scenes.
They said to me, "Don't go anywhere with that hat."
I've been tortured!
They said I've been hit," said the Washington Examiner.
The West continued, "Do you want to see down?" and he said he'd wear his Superman's suit because that means I can't tell him what to do.
Try with love."
The magazine Variety wrote that his comments have at least doubled the public's neglect, and the members of the Day Night Live show have become ashamed, while one person for the magazine said, "The whole studio is silent."
West has been invited at the last moment as a substitute for singer Arian Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, reper Mac Miller passed a few days ago.
The West is the execution of the song "I love it", dressed like the bottle of mineral water Perrier, has caught many.
Westa supported Candace Turner, head of the TPSA Conservative Group, who announced on Twitter: "One of the bravest people: Thank you for what you're doing with Mafia."
However, the director of the show Karen Hunter on Twitter announced that the West was simply "his own and that it was absolutely beautiful".
"But I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music, clothing or by supporting his "art") for whom I believe to accept and expand the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we," she added.
Before the show, the reper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, saying he will now "be officially known under the name Kanye West".
He's not the first artist who changed his name and followed Didy's steps, also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Reper Snoop Dogg, called Snoop Lion, and of course, the music legend Prince changed his name in symbol, and then into an artist previously known as Prince.

The star series Game of History Kit Harrington fought for toxicity
Kit Harrington is known for the role of Jon Snow, who is playing a ball in HBO's violent medieval fantasy game of history.
But a 31-year-old actor competed on the stereotype of the hero's sword, saying that children often feel that due to such television roles, they must be firm enough to gain respect.
In a discussion on the list of The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxicity in #MeToo eri.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old colleague Rose Leslie from the game series, admitted that he wants to "very determined" face this problem.
"I personally feel very determined at this moment – where have we been wrong with the masculinity?" he asked.
"What have we learned from these men as they grew up, in relation to the problem we now see?"
Kit believes that television, thanks to very male figures on screens, could be partly responsible for the growth of toxicity.
He continued: “What has been born, and what has been learned?
What do you teach on TV and on the streets, and that kids feel that they have to have these certain black men?
I think it's actually one of the big questions of our time – how can we change this?
'Cause obviously something went wrong for the boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not record the series's performances of the game by the end of the next summer and said he was "completed with warriors and horses".
From the student Kit will play in the new performance of the true West exhibition of author Sam Shepard, talks about the film producer and his brother's theft.
The actor recently discovered that he felt that meeting Rose's wife was the best thing that happened to him during the video game.
"I met my wife recording that series, which she so gave me my family and the future," he discovered.
Rose was in a fantastic series that won Emma's prize playing the role of Ygritte, the love of Kitto's son Jon Snow.
A couple married in June 2018 on the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% rise in new cases of disease
China announced that by 14%, the population living with HIV and AIDS increased by 14%.
Health workers say more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted by sex, which has been changed in relation to the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted to some parts of China as a result of the transfusion of infected blood.
At a conference in the province of Yunnan, health authorities said that the person who is infected with HIV in this way is still not present.
However, each year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV to sex is a constant problem between the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT is a big person.
Research estimates that 70 to 90% of men having sexual relations with other men will eventually marry women due to conservative values in the country.
Many cases of transfer of disease in such relationships occur because of inadequate protection during sex.
As part of the effort to address this problem, the Chinese government promised free access to HIV in 2003.
Maxine Waters suggests that a member of the public has access to GOP senators, calling it "dangerous lies" and "trust theories"
The U.S. representative Maxine Walters rejected the statement on Saturday that a member of her staff has published personal data from three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages.
A Democrat from Los Angeles asserts that he claims to be a "ultra of the right wing" as well as a web site.
"False lies, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The published data reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of American senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrina Hatcha, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network on Thursday and was published by an unknown person with Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate Committee on the allegations of sexual access of the candidates of the Supreme Court of Britta Kavanaugh.
The information was searched after three senators were interviewed by Kavanaugh.
Conservative Web sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that reveals the source of these data is part of the Waters representative's office, as well as information about the staff member's representative, have reported the news of The Hill.
"These unfounded claims are completely wrong and absolutely false," Waters continued.
‘Member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security are compromised as a result of these false and misleading statements – is not at all responsible for storing these data.
These unfounded claims are completely wrong and absolutely false."
Ms. Waters' statement quickly attracted critics on the Internet, including an ex-computer of the White House of Aria Fleischera.
"This is angering," Fleischer wrote.
"It shows that Waters has no temperature to be a member of Congress.
Someone who is accused of something he hasn't done should not be angry.
It shouldn't be boring.
The prosecutor's motives must not be examined.
It has to be calm and stable."
It was thought that Fleischer compared the reaction of Barbara Walters to the criticisms that Democrats led Judge Kavanaugh, who accused himself of being too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate in general elections against Waters, also announced on Twitter.
"It's important if it's true," he wrote.
Waterss, in his statement, stated that her office had informed “the international body and governing bodies of these false claims. ”
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered and that they have legal consequences for all the work that is harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet," she continued.
A review of the film "Johnny English: Re-on-the-job" – insufficiently interesting Rowan Atkinson struggle against spy
Now it is already customary in every new British film to look for messages about Brexit, and it seems to be also in the new screening of the Johnny English Action Series, whose first follow-up under the name "Johnny English" was shown for the first time in 2003, and in 2011 he returned to the big screen with the title "Johnny English again".
Will our own satisfactory about how worthless we are to become a new national export opportunity?
Incapacitated Johnny English has permission for the situation to be complicated again, while his name says more than anything about a comical creation for a wide audience designed for countries where cinematography is not in English.
He is, of course, a secret agent who, despite his extraordinary claims on "distinct" glambre reminds Inspector Clouseau, has the character of Mr. Beana and has even reminded him of the boy who sang one note of the opening song "Chariots of Fire" at the 2012 opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games.
His character was also inspired by a traveler and a mysterious world man who once played Atkinson in the area of already forgotten TV ads for Barclaycard and who's throwing chaos.
There's one or two convenient moments in this latest film release.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in the middle of the middle of the year and when the propeller just hit his helmet.
It is visible atkinson's talent for a physical comedy, but humor is thought to be quite uninterested and unusual, especially now when "serious" film titles such as "007" and "Infinite Mission" are offered by itself.
Humor is thought to be intended for children, not adults, and I think that Johnny English's stories are not as innovative and focused as those Atkinson's gegos are not made up like Mr. Bean.
The assumption that Great Britain is in serious trouble is now a general fact.
Hacker went into the fastest British spy web network and discovered the identity of all British agents, at the shame of an agent's duty, which unfortunately briefly appeared by Kevin Eldon.
It was a glass of the prime minister's patience, extreme and combative character that experienced the complete collapse of the system because it was politically forced: Emma Thompson is trying to be faithful to show a character who should represent Theresa May, but she didn't really get the material to do something with.
The intelligence consultants discover to her that all active spies are compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate the deceased agent.
And this person will be unattended Johnny English head and shoulder who is currently employed as the manager of some retired school, but then he teaches how to become a secret agent: there are several comfortable gegos here because English teaches spying in rock style.
English quickly leads to the government's office at an emergency meeting, where it will meet again with Boughho, the former partner and his eternal victim, who plays Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an enthusiast commander of the submarine who plays Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is largely consumed.
And so the two members of Her Majesty's Secret Service who are doing all the wrong are returning to action and meeting a beautiful fatal woman, Ophelia Bulletov, who was inspired by Olga Curylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems, bad Jason Volte, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their exciting journey with absurd and ridiculous events: destroyed in the conobars, the French restaurant is blocked, the challenge of huge messing up on the Voltin luxury yacht, and English challenges the full anarchy trying to use the virtual reality audience to find out how it looks inside Voltine's house.
Everything has been done just the right thing for this last move, but whatever the film was attractive and interesting, it still contains a percentage of the children's elements.
It's quite a medium-term achievement.
And as was the case with other movies about Johnny English, did I ask again whether the British film industry can't give Rowan Atkinson a role that would match his talent?
The lab party recommends that they develop a plan for the British to work four days a week and be paid in five days
Laburist partner Jeremy Corbin will consider a radical plan that the British would work for four days a week and were paid for five-day work.
The party claims that the bosses of the company will save their workers from the real revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and give them an additional day of freedom.
This would mean that employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources suggest that the idea could be "integrated" into a foreign economic programme and plans to attract the country to the interests of workers.
The syndicated convention is a four-day work week transfer as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A high source from the Laburist Party said for the newspaper The Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
"The four-day working week will not be achieved by night, but it represents a difficulty that is adapted to the approach this party has to manage the economy for the benefit of the worker, as well as the overall industrial strategy of this party."
The Laburist Party would not be the first to provide its support for such an idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
However, the Laburist Party does not accept this burden fully.
A spokesman for the Laburist Party said: "The four-day working week is not a party policy and the party does not consider it."
The shadow officer John McDonnell used the last year's Laburist Party conference to interpret his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he decided to overrun power from "individual managers" and "profetor" in municipal companies.
The Office plans in shadow also mean that current distributors in water companies may not be able to repay their full contribution because the Laburist government could make "response" on the basis of identified irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to include a worker in the Administrative Board of Companies and to create inclusive own funds so that 10 percent of private companies' capital would be paid to employees, which would generate an annual dividend of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Bretta Kavanaugh has resulted in a final vote on his appeal for the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question whether the Agency's conclusion can affect the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that was broadcast Sunday, the journalist "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley, asked Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a possibility that the FBI would find out something that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said next to the discussion, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that happened, after those instructions were removed, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, irreverent, unintended."
Graham's voice, though, like he's stuck in the rock.
"I'm determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and really should be strongly accused of changing it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett is definitely disappointed," Graham added thinking about Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the person she named could confirm her claim.
It's been 36 years since.
I don't see anything has changed."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has anything been achieved on poverty reduction?
On Saturday, New York will be host to the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with an extremely impressive record of stars and the same impressive mission – ending poverty in the world.
Over the past seven years, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only the performances of stars, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of the event, ending extreme poverty by the year 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is the expansion of the Global Poverty Project project, the international negotiating group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to obtain an event free entrance (except if they were not willing to pay a VIP entrance), concert visitors had to perform tasks or "work" such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to the world leader, telephone calls or any other meaningful way of raising awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen actually been in considering that it has been 12 years for him to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts the right way to convince people to call for action, or just another case such as "clicitivism" – where people feel that signing online petitions or sending tweets really makes a difference?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed that it has marked more than 19 million "actions" of its accessions that have made it difficult to achieve a range of objectives.
It claims that these actions have been the motivation of world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will lead to an amount of $37 billion that will affect lives by the year 2030 more than 2.25 billion people.
By the beginning of 2018 the group had made 390 commitments and declarations arising from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secured resources have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of investors and executives in the United Kingdom that seeks to "help children to develop their full potential", with the promise that after receiving more than 4700 tweets from citizens around the world will provide $35 million to help Ruandi with the goal of completing inflation in this area.
"With the help of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, like you, we can achieve that social injustice only becomes a fuse in history," said Tracey Ulman, the capitalist of the "The Power of Nutrition", published at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions undertaken to improve food for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the "The Power of Nutrition" project that will provide food intervention for 5 million women and children.
As an answer to one of the most frequently asked questions on your website, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen answers: “It will be a long and hard way to cope with failure.
But we're going to succeed, like they've made great moves for civil rights and against apartheid before us, because we're stronger together.
The events of Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawna Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among some of the events of this year's event in New York that will lead Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy as a "blockade" to prevent Russian energy exports from being used by the Ministry of Internal Affairs
Washington can, "if necessary", use its own Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, revealed the US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, as weekly Washington Examiner says.
Zinke said that he was a Russian agent in Syria especially where he works at the legitimate government's invitation to an excuse to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why Russia is in the Middle East is what it wants to sell energy in this area as it does in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he says.
But, according to him, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, with the help of seafarers, can ensure the openness of maritime routes and blockade, if necessary, in order to ensure that their energy is not marketed," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants to an event where the host was a non-profit group of Consumer Energy Alliance, represented in the United States as "the voice of energy consumers".
He compared Washington's access to Russia and Iran, pointing out how they were actually the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less utilizing and replacing fuels," he said, and for Russia it says that "the same trick" is used in the fossil fuels-dependent economies.
Statements were made simultaneously with the intention of the Trump Administration to increase its exports of natural gas to Europe, which would replace Russia, a far more cheap option for European consumers.
In this sense, Trump's officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" North Stream 2 gas pipeline project (Northern Stream 2), which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "harvest" in Moscow.
Moscow has in many ways stressed that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline is worth 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the severe opposition to the Washington project is simply motivated by economic reasons and that unfair competition is an example.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of delivering pressure and that consumers should be able to select suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with American Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in June.
The U.S. station has caused a German reaction that has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), invited the US to close the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third country comes to our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), following a recent meeting of German Chancellor Angele Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "determinely consider" the possibility of candidates for the president of 2020, says the Senate of the Union of Massachusetts.
The Senate of the Federal State of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren stated on Saturday that the candidate will be "seriously discussed" after the mid-year elections.
During a direct meeting with the citizens in Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking she was also a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that's understandable to a woman on her head," said The Hill.
"After 6th study, I will seriously consider the possibility of candidates for president."
Warren drew up an opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting with the citizens, saying that "this country is headed in the wrong direction".
"I'm worried about Donald Trump doing our democracy," she said.
Warren was openly criticised by Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugh.
In a tweet published on Friday, Warren says, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that most Warren voters do not think they should be candidates for 2020.
According to a study by the Center for Political Research at Suffolk / Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the "probably" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not apply.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidate.
The survey showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidate, with 38% vote for potential candidate and 48% against.
The remaining names of the Democrats discussed in connection with a potential race for President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders were discussed in 2020.
Biden said he'd make an official decision by June, the Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSP Track Palina at Donald Trumpa
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after he reported in June.
He was arrested and charged for a family violence incident that occurred on Monday night
"What my son goes through, what goes through after his return, is comparable to other families who feel the consequences of PTSP and other wounds our soldiers return with," said a public meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsi, Oklahoma.
Palin's arrest called the general problem that he was hiding and for his son and other war veterans said that "they return a little different, they return to refuse, they come back asking if they have respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots have done, and all the other members of the army have given to this country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasill, Alaska, and charged with family violence against women, arrest of family violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state, says Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the police department of the city of Wasille.
18 EU countries and D.C. support a review of the new asylum policy
Eighty states and the Columbia District support the legal challenges of a new US policy that reduces asylum to victims fleeing from gangs or violence in the family.
The representatives of the 18 federal states and districts submitted a friendly report on Friday in Washington to support the asylum seeker who is opposed to politics, reports the NBC News.
Many names of prosecutors in Grace v. Sessions' complaint against the American Union for Civil Liberties have not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" had been abused, but US officials rejected her asylum request on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum applicants come, such as countries facing emerging problems with gangs and family violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States changed the 2014 immigration committee's decision to grant immigrants who do not have documents and flee violence in the family, allowing them to apply for asylum.
In his statement on Friday, the state lawyer of Colombia, Karl Racine, said that the new policy "ignores the decades of state, Union and international law".
"The federal law finds that all asylum applications are resolved on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the complaint, and such a ban violates this principle," says a friend of the court's report.
Lawyers further claimed that a policy that reduces immigrants' income would damage the US economy, claiming that it would be more likely to become entrepreneurs and "insure the necessary labour force".
The chief state lawyer Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing from family violence and gang violence in June.
"Azil is available to those who leave their home because of persecution or fear of race, belief, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political opinion," Sessions said in their statement on policy on 11 June.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all problems even the serious problems that people face every day throughout the world.
desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of victims is doubled in the race for survival
The situation was all too difficult for survival.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her little boy who moved into a mine in an evacuation center in the abandoned city of Palau.
"The speed of emergency aid every minute of the body's imports.
The government has condemned clean water."
The inhabitants are seen returning to their destroyed homes, counting through the flooded things, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by 7.5 degrees, were cramped.
Some of the injured, including Dwiy Harisa, who suffered from back and shoulders injury, sat in front of the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated in open due to continued severe postpartum seizures.
His tears filled his eyes as he talked about the feeling of violent harassment that hit the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"It wasn't time to save ourselves.
I think I was trapped inside the ruins of the wall," said Harris for Associated Press, adding that his family came to the city for marriage.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then she followed the silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "maltration" through "propagand advertising"
A week after the official Chinese newspapers published four pages of a long notice in an American daily list that promoted the mutual benefit of US and China trade, an American ambassador in China accused Beijing of violating the American press for spreading propaganda.
American President Donald Trump responded on Wednesday to a paid addition to China Daily newspaper in the most sold newspapers in Iowa, Des Moines Register, after accusing China of wanting to join the US Congress elections on Saturday, which China rejects.
The trumpet claim that Beijing is trying to get involved in the American elections was noted by the US officials in the Reuters statement as a new phase of the Washington Escalator campaign to carry out pressure on China.
Although it is normal for governments to place commercial promotion ads, Beijing and Washington are currently closed in the scalaring trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
The Chinese withdrawals at the beginning of the trade war were designed to strike exporters in such countries as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and former former governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural products in China, said Peking hurt American workers, farmers and companies.
In an article in the Sunday edition of the newspaper Des Moines Register, Branstad says that China "now doubles this abuse by launching propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and free press by putting the advertising paid in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, you will find limited votes against in the streets of Beijing on the Kyoto for news on the streets and you will not see any real impact on the various views that the Chinese people may have on the disturbing Chinese economic journey because the media are under the strong pressure of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most impressive Chinese newspapers rejected the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say what the news was about.
Kavanaugh's debate drew the voters away from the mid-year elections, warning analysts
Since many Republicans are with a candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh and defend him by referring to several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn how this will lead to negative reactions during the forthcoming mid-year elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding this event were also alarmed, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to vote.
Such things can't come back," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell University of Syracuse, said for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubts that the latest intensification of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arison) to conduct a FBI investigation would be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday . . . . . . . will not forget it tomorrow, nor in the studio," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national vocalist of the progressive movementOn, said a newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the prosecutors said, "Come students!", protesting in the Senate hall, while the Republicans controlling the Legal Committee prepared to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reports Mic.
"Enthusiastism and motivation for democracy will be beyond all expectations," said political analyst Stu Rothenberg to the press.
"People say they're already high, which is true.
But it could be even higher, especially among women in the suburbs and young voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who, although not pleased with the president, often don't vote."
Even before the Ford's public testimony, in which its allegations of sexual assault by the Supreme Court judge are detailed, analysts suggest that a negative reaction could occur if the Republicans continue to confirm.
"It's a real mistake to the great old party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, says NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote in the committee or the final vote, nor about whether Kavanaugh was sent to the record club, but about the way the Republicans responded to it and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Priority Organization, a group that helps in the democratic elections.
However, it seems that the Americans are even divided about who will believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more enthusiasm for him.
A new survey published by YouGov shows that 41 percent of researchers are definitely or likely to believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said that Kavanaugh is safe or likely to believe.
In addition, 38 percent said that Kavanaugh thought he was probably or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent claimed the same for Fordov.
After Fleke's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations that Ford has issued, along with at least one more prosecutor, Deboro Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
The forum witnessed before the Senate's Legal Committee during the last week that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunk state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that her candidate for Judge of the Supreme Court showed her genitals at the party during a study at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web User Plans to launch a new Internet to download Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company aimed at becoming Facebook, Amazon and Google competition.
The latest project of this legend technology, Inrupt, is a company that develops on the basis of Berners-Lee's open platform Solid.
Solid enables users to choose a place to store their data and people who will be allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview for the Fast Company, Berners-Lee found out how the purpose behind the Inrupt "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said thinking about the start.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "private network storage" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, commitment lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
What's unique when it comes to personal online data storage is that it's a decision on who can access the information in full of users.
The company calls it "personal data-based".
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce's Chief Executive Director, is that the company provides resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid become available to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Leea, Bruce, security platforms that bought IBM, several engineers that signed a project contract, as well as community volunteers.
Since this week, developing engineers around the world have been able to produce their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt site.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team do not talk to Facebook and Google about whether they will or not introduce a complete change in which all their business models would turn overnight completely.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a press release published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of new networks built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded World Wide Web concerts at the Massachusetts State Institute of Technology (MIT).
Last month Berners-Lee had a powerful voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even as the Inrupt starts, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and manager of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Institute of Open Data.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about the next issue of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the First World War of the Victorian Cross · Global Voices
The celebration in the honour of the only Anglican church that is represented by Victorian cross as a soldier in the First World War was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later .
Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on 29th of June 1918 in an attack on Bellengles and Lehacourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a rapist and never found out that he had received the greatest honor of the British war.
The monumental stone found two of his grandsons in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was "unbelievably symbolic" that the stone would be discovered about 100 years after his grandfather's confession for it.
According to a report on the official list of London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion through St. Quentina’s canal “through a very dense fog and under a strong fire which came from the direction of the war field and machine. ”
He later rushed into the first lines and led the march ahead with “unbelieving courage” but without any help, he jumped to the field top and shot three of the military commanders.
Colonel Vanna was killed by the German sniper on 4 November 1918. ▸ something more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never achieve, and that's encouraging humility".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed a prisoner after the parade, led by the parade orchestra Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it feels very honored to participate in the paradise" and added that "the courage of the true hero is shown through the support that many people will give."
Lovers of mixed combat skills have been awake all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they've got Praščic Peppu.
Imagine this â You stay awake all night to watch the Bellator 206 matches so that you will eventually be unable to follow the main event.
The program from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in Great Britain they showed up alive at night on channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready for each other's fight, the British observers were shocked when the transfer stopped Praščić Peppa.
Many were not impressed after only the fighting left them awake till early in the morning.
One fan described a child’s short transfer on Twitter as “such a sick joke. ”
"According to the state regulation, this content is not suitable for issue at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to the child programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior marketing and communication president of Bellatora, when they asked him about the transfer.
"Jupi, "Pick Peppa."
Bellator's president, Scott Cooker, said he would coordinate his schedules to include viewers from Great Britain in the future.
"When I consider reprising, I think we can probably fix something," Coker said.
"But the transfer is there at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, and we won't be able to realize anything until Sunday comes to us, when it's already Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transfer was interrupted, there were many prescriptions that were not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But he wasn't.
I can promise you the next time it doesn't come.
We're going to keep five fights instead of six what we're doing or what we're doing, and we're trying to give more to our fans, but we're overextended.
"There's an accident."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
The Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up with a feeling of inferiority to others because of his sexuality but that gave him motivation to be successful.
Twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to high school, he was not aware that “they were not all like me. ”
In his statement on Radio 4 Desert Island disks, leading by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals in order to give others a "hope".
He also said his victory at the Olympic Games was less important than his father.
The regular director of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, took several months of rest because of the disease.
Acting as a loser in the first Lavernian show, Daley said that during his adult life he felt "a little less valuable" than others because "there was no socially acceptable love for boys and girls".
He said: “To this day, you feel inferior and different about the others were the real things that gave me the strength and strength to succeed. ”
He said he wanted to prove that he was "someone and something" so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
A two-year winner of the bronze Olympic medal became an outstanding figure for LGBT people and took advantage of his initiative at this year's Game Commonwealtha` in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke publicly because he felt that he was happy that he could live openly without consequences and that he wanted to give others “a hope. ”
Trotsuki the world's first said it surprised him that he fell in love with a man named Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013.
Daley married a publisher who was 20 years older than he was last year, but he said that his differences in years never posed a problem.
"When so young you go through so much" ▸ turned to his first Olympic game when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later ¢ he said it was hard to find someone of the same years and that he experienced similar successes and falls.
In June they became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all perspectives" changed.
"If you asked me last year, all the stories would be about 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are more things than gold Olympic medals.
Robbie is my gold Olympic medal."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 over 40 years after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they got tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be first.
"I couldn't say to him, 'Dad, you won't be here long enough to be first," he said.
"I held him by the hand while he was up, and only then when he stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he was not inevitable," he said.
The next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
"I knew it was just what I had dreamed of all my life to jump before the local audience at the Olympic Games, it wasn't a better feeling," he said.
It was also an inspiration to select the first song "Proud" singer Heather Small , who was dressed in it while preparing for the Olympic Games and who is always on it .
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio for 4 weeks at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson outside the club on Ryder's word on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to get back completely in order to avoid an unpleasant switch.
Mickelson, who, in this two-year competition game record the second time, sent Captain Jim Furyk to the club on Saturday with four volts and fours.
Instead of being in the middle of action, as was often for the United States, the petro-strike winner spent a day driving and building his games at the gym hoping to correct what he suffers.
Never the most accurate player, not even at the top of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for the demanding Le Golf National field, where long irregular ground routine punishment strikes inaccurate.
And if I'm not afraid enough, mickelson's in the nineth match on Sunday confronts the precise first British Open Francescom Molinari, who won with the new Tommy Fleetwood in all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who start 12 individual games with four points less, come to the hot start, the Michaelson game could be absolutely key.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"He fully understood the role he had today, backed me up, buried me, and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"There's a lot of self-reliance."
He's famous and has brought a lot of teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't imagine playing two games.
I thought it would be more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought we should do it.
He wants to be in the field, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will record Nick Falda on the number of games played in Ryder's bathroom on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career in Ryder's suit that never really reached the degree of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 injuries and seven semi-times, although Furyk said his presence brought some material value in it.
"He's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to fuck people and he's a great guy for that," he explained.
"I think the young players were having fun with him and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than the game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great privilege can soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage in the last day of the individual Ryder match can easily be transformed into an unpleasant race.
The Danac was in the fight in Valderrami in 1997, where Captain Sevea Ballesteros' team took advantage of five points in relation to the Americans, but the game ended with their victory with a sharp difference from 141⁄2 ⁄131⁄2.
"You always remember that we had a great advantage in Valderrami; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but in a real difference," said Bjorn, in a way, after observing the 2018 boy who won the score 5 ⁄3 on Friday and yesterday led to 10 ⁄6 in the Le Golf National field.
So, history will show me and everyone that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you'll play full power.
Get out of the field and do everything you can.
Nothing's done until it's announced on the board.
We have a goal, and it's an attempt to win this trophy, and that remains the focus.
All the time I'm talking, I focus on 12 players who are on our side, but we're still aware of who's standing against us. The biggest players in the world."
Excited by the behavior of his players in the heavy golf field, Bjorn added: “I would never run in this direction before the crowd.
He's trying to face another beast tomorrow.
Tomorrow's the main individual events, and that's something different.
It's great to play with a partner when everything's going well, but when you're there as an individual, eventually your ability to play golf is tested.
It's a message you have to pass on to the players, and it's that tomorrow they have to give the best of themselves.
Now leave your pursuer because he has to give the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorna, his colleague on the opposite side, Jim Furyk, will ask their players to play better individually than they did with fellow players, excluding Jordan Spietha and Justin Thomas, who collected three points from four.
Furyk and I were on both sides of these big revolutions of the last days, since it was part of the winning boys in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser after Europe performed "a miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," said Ben Crenshaw in response to the question of how he encouraged his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve great results at the very beginning like what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When that bullet goes in a certain direction, it puts a big pressure on the middle of the ball.
In accordance with that, we organized our position and put the guys like we'll, you know, try to perform magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lead the counterattack and face Rory McIrroy in the main fight, and Paul Casey, Justine Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Jan Poulter to face the other Europeans in the upper half.
I decided that this group of guys is going through this mess because I think it's covering everything," Bjorn said about the selected players for individual matches.
Germany's new warship re-established to wait
The latest freshest German warships should be released in spring 2014 in order to replace the old warships during the cold war, but will not be ready until the next year due to incorrect systems and increased costs, local media have reported.
The release of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the entire new class of frigates Baden-Wuertmberg, is now due to the first half of 2019, reports a list of Die Zeit indicating a military speaker.
The ship was supposed to join the mariners in 2014, but worrying the problems after the shipment hit the fate of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuertmberg vessels, which the Navy has ordered yet 2007, will replace the old frigate class Bremen.
As is known, there will be a strong top, low anti-traumatic and anti-traubrody rockets, as well as some invisible technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods â It should be possible to arrange the latest frigates during a period of up to two years without returning to the mother’s womb.
However, continuous delays mean that the most modern warships are to be said to enable Germany to demonstrate its foreign powers to the point of entry into service to become older, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate came to all the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to leave the ship in use and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time a sailor has returned the ship to the ship builder after delivery.
It was little known about the reasons for the return, but German media used a number of key "software and hardware deficiencies" that would make the warship useless if they were sent to the battle mission.
The software deficits were particularly important because the Baden-Wuertmberg class ships will manage crews from about 120 nautical miles below the old Bremen class frigates.
It has also been shown that the ship is a dramatic burden that reduces its effectiveness and limits the ability of the sea to add future upgrades.
It is believed that "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7000 tonnes is twice the weight of ships of similar class used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the incorrect hardware, the prices of the entire project include the training of crews also become a problem.
It is said that the price reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) compared to the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems affecting the latest frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that German maritime forces are being reduced.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Committee for Defence, admitted that sailors are actually "lost ships capable of deploying".
The officer said that this problem was growing in time, because the old ships were put out of force, and there were no replacement ships.
He expressed regret that none of the cool Baden-Württemberg classes could join the sailors.
The National Reserve is listening to the secret life of the cold.
New research on property in Scotland is aimed at discovering how smoother uses locals in food money.
There is hope that the results will explain the behaviour of these unique flight recorders and help in managing future conservation activities.
Studies carried out by scientists at the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will follow the usual and powerful pathogens of droughts, as well as the salts of long-lasting and riverous droughts in the Inverwe gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property in order to monitor fast-acting activities throughout the season.
NTS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile checks using manual detectors.
The technical analysis of the sound of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the loudness and what type of voice it does.
Then a map of the stations and reports will be made to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural protection adviser to the NTS, hopes that the results will be discovered which areas are the most important for the deaf and how they are used by all kinds of people.
This information will help to determine the benefits of working on the management of the stations, such as the creation of leaves and how to best maintain forest surfaces for molluscs and other related species.
In Scotland and across the United Kingdom there has been a significant decline over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and work on equipment that affects shelters and loss of residence.
Air turbines and radiation can also pose a threat, as well as certain chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks by cat pets.
The shirts aren't really blind.
However, because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching fat.
They use sophisticated ecology technique to find bubbles and obstacles on their flight.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, appreciates it more closely.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly conduct research, check shelters, and sometimes save.
The organisation even set up the first and only reserve for skis in Scotland on the property of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, where there are eight of the ten types of skiming that occur in Scotland.
The manager, David Thompson, says possession is an ideal area for them.
"Here in Threave we have a huge area for the skimpy," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old buildings and all the good buildings.
However, there is still a lot of what we don't know about the bats, so the job we do here and on other objects will help us understand better what they need for progress."
It stresses the importance of checking the presence of the cold before the work on maintenance inside the building, since the sudden destruction of one bed can kill up to 400 women and young people, thereby likely destroying the entire local population.
They are protected and illegally killed, tortured or disturbed or destroyed by their shelters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, representative of the Scottish Anti-Fraud Association, urged the public to help.
She said: “We still have much to learn about our deaf people, and for many of our species, we simply don’t know how their population progresses.”
Ronaldo rejects the claim of rape while lawyers are preparing to charge German newspaper
Cristian Ronaldo is accused of violence against him described as "false news", saying that people "will promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will charge the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was charged with rape by the American name Kathryn Mayor in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he paid $375,000 at the time to keep an eye on the incident, reported on Friday, Der Spiegel.
In a video of life that he posted on the Instagram for his 142 million followers a few hours after the complaint was filed, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the allegations as “false news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the five-star winner of the Gold Ballet in the camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to speak my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the legometant with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel for a claim that they called "an unacceptable report on doubts in the field of privacy," Reuters says.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said you're going to ask for "a moral damage in the amount corresponding to the weight of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the last few years."
It is reported how the above incident occurred in June 2009 in the apartment in the hotel and the Palms casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Maorga, as reported, returned to the legometasse room, where she reportedly had been raped by anal violence, were mentioned in the documents that were filed in the District Court of Clark in Nevada.
Major says Ronaldo fell on his knees after the above-mentioned incident and told her that "99 percent" was a "good guy" who failed that "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that a couple had sex, but that he was reasonable.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that she was photographed of injuries in the hospital, but that later she agreed to an outside deal because "she was afraid of revenge" and was worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
Thirty-nine-year-olds say she wants to cancel the deal now because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to Real Madrid from Manchester, United States, during an emergency attack, and this summer he was transferred to the Italian Juve in the amount of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will "always cry" lost car manufacturers
The UK will "always mourn" if after Brexit loses the status of the world leader in the production of the car, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added how "anxious" is what Toyota UK told BBC that, in case Britain leaves the EU without agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of waiting on borders in Brexit's case could cause the loss of jobs without agreement.
In the past year, the Pogon Burnaston, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis, has produced nearly 150 000 cars, 90 % of which have been exported to the rest of the European Union.
"It is my position that if Britain comes out of the EU without agreement at the end of the summer, we will experience the sustainable production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director General Toyotin in Burnstone.
Other car manufacturers in the UK expressed fears about leaving the EU without agreeing on possible consequences for cross-border trade, including Hondu, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says he'll close his Miniature factory in Oxford in a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car manufacturer concerns the risks of the supply chain in the case of Brexit without a successful agreement.
Toyotin production line works according to the principle of "time management", where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for vehicles operating under orders.
If the UK leaves the EU without the agreement on 29 March, it could come to an end at the border for which the industry says it could lead to delays and lack of shares.
Toyota in his factory in Derbyshire could not hold more goods than those needed for one day, they said from that company, so the production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that the "Checkers" plan, which offers Theresa May for future relations with the EU, is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We must agree. We want to achieve the best possible agreement that will allow, as I say, not only the maintenance of the current success but also the use of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence not only toyote, but also other producers show that we must be absolutely able to continue this very successful range of supply chains."
In Toyota, they could not say how long production could be stopped, but they warned that long-term monitoring would reduce the costs of the factory's competitiveness and eventually lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a member of the union of the United States who works in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members were more concerned: “In my experience, after you're gone, never come back again. ”
The speaker of the government says: "We have issued a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House.
An important meeting of Donald Trumpa with a replacement of State attorney Rod Rosenstein could "be held for another week" as the fight against the Supreme Court of Justice Britta Kavanaugh continued, White House was announced.
Rosenstein monitors the work of Special Advocate Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's involvement in the election, the relationship between Trompo's and Russia's co-operations and any interference with the justice of the president.
The question is whether Trump will release a replacement of a state lawyer, and then threaten Mueller's independence, which has been spreading strikes in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the wearing of a wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of withdrawing the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected this statement.
But last Monday he went to the White House in the middle of the announcement that he would just take the leave.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said "I wouldn't like" to release Rosenstein, but the meeting was arranged to avoid a compromise with the hearing of the Senate's Legal Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, which further resulted in a lot of Senate vote.
The print crew's secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Regarding the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not set, it could be this week; and it could be postponed for another week taking into account all the rest of the case with the Supreme Court.
Well, we'll see, and I always like to inform the press about everything."
Some journalists would argue that Sanders did not hold a press conference at the White House on 10th of September.
Leader Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of a press conference was not due to the "theatrical behaviour" of television reporters, although she said, "I will not oppose the fact that I am moving."
Then she announced that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president organizes more meetings for answers to questions than any president before him," she added without stating the evidence: "We have analysed the numbers."
The short communication will continue to occur, Sanders said, but "if journalists have an opportunity to ask the US president directly, that is definitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to make this possible often, and you can see it in the last few weeks, and that's just how you can talk to the President of the United States will replace a brief press address."
The Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open meetings or press conferences with visiting officials.
The single press conferences are rare.
This week, the president in New York may have shown why, free and sometimes strange behaviour in front of the journalists gathered.
Health Minister writes to EU workers at the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland for fear of Brexit
The Ministry of Health has sent a letter to EU staff employed in the Scottish NHS to express gratitude and wish to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter six months before the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.
The Scotland Government has already committed itself to lower the costs of raising the demands for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: “Over the years negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal, which are moving towards the expected decisions of this autumn.
However, the United Kingdom government is also strengthening preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very difficult period for all of you.
That is why I would now like to reiterate the value of the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from all over the EU, and more widely, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie under an emergency operation after head injury
The online player of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered head injury in a sub-clause from the Vanderbilt Commodores club with a result from 31 ⁄27, reports Mike Organ from Tennessee.
The main trainer of Tennessee, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-hour.
"He came to the game line and just collapsed," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the ground before they put it on their clothes and sent it on further search.
Abercrombie of the state University of Tennessee State said Chris Harris from the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie went out of surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there's no "detail of the species/depletion of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when it came to the injury.
Abercrombie, a third-year student from two years of playing stage, plays the first season for Tennessee State after crossing Illinois.
On Saturday, he had five rounds before leaving the game, which he achieved 18 rounds in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom
According to new conservation plans, foreign buyers will be paid more compensation for buying real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people
This step will neutralize the success of Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in fees will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Riznica expects to collect up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be paid a higher fee for buying real estate in the United Kingdom and that additional money will be used to help homeless people.
That move will be understood as an attempt to neutralize Jeremiah Corbin's success to attract young voters' promises to ensure a more satisfactory solution and to focus on those with high wages.
The increase in fees will be paid by individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money will contribute to the Government's efforts in the fight against unemployment.
An additional fee ¢ which is collected at the current fee, including an increase which was introduced two years ago to other households and real estate purchases for the sale ¢ may be up to three per cent.
The rice is expected to collect 120 million pounds per year on this move.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built estates in London are purchased by residents who do not have a residence in the UK, increasing prices and making it difficult for buyers to buy the first real estate to join the company of those who have their own home.
Many rich areas in the country ¢ especially in the capital ¢ have become "the cities of spirits" because of a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy followed only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in fees to help a larger number of young people come to their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices of real estate by taking or not taking advantage of the land, and called on Mrs May to withdraw from the quota to cheaply satisfied real estate in order to correct the "responsibility of the situation" in Britain.
Corbyn announced the proposal of a series of attractive reformes, including the control of the housing and at the end of no due process.
He also wants to give more authority to build new houses.
“ Last year, ” said Mrs. May, “I said that I would dedicate my mandate to the restoration of Britain’s dream of a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing our collapse of the stem market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build lives.
However, it cannot be fair that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies with an alien origin, can buy homes as easily as worthy British.
The dream of owning the house has become too far, and the shame of homelessness still remains real."
Jack Ross: "My final ambition to manage Scotland"
Chief Sanderland Jack Ross says his "final ambition" one day has become the director of Scotland.
Schkot (42) enjoys the challenge of the restoration of the Northeast club, currently occupying the third place in the First League, with three points less than water.
This summer he moved to St. Mirren's Stadium after the last season led again to a Scottish football club.
"I wanted to behave for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that's it," Ross said to BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and that always pushed me back.
But this opportunity could only be realized if I was successful in managing the club."
Ross's presidents on the position of Governor Sunderland include Dicka Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardycea, Martina O'Neilla, Roy Keanea, Gusa Poyeta and Paula Di Cania.
Former Chief Alla Athletic says he didn't feel afraid because he inherited so well-known names in such a large club, after he had previously rejected calls at Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"The success of me at this moment will be measured by whether I will be able to return this club to the Premier League.
Because of its structure and content, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably think myself successful only if I could get the club back there."
Ross is only in his third year career, after a period during which he was assistant chief in Dumbarton and 15-month experience as part of Hearts' training staff.
He then helped Alloi recover from falling into the third category and took St. Mirren from the edge of the landing to the winner of the title of the first following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his sports careers in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It must have been a real crackdown," Alloe recalled.
"I really believed that management was what suits me more than playing.
It sounds unusual because I made a good deal, worked hard, and enjoyed pretty successful moments.
But the game can be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in the sense of stress and pressure, but management seems to be the right thing.
I've always wanted to run, and now I'm doing it, and I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I've ever felt in my life."

The perfect time for the point is at 17:30 on Saturday, how the survey shows
The summer heat wave increased the arrivals of British pubs who suffered financial hardship, but it increased pressure on the range of restaurants.
The data show that pubs and barons have achieved an increase in income in August by 2.7%, but the income in restaurants has been reduced by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the Business Counsellor’s Office of Business Books, who collected the data, said: “The continuation of the beautiful time and participation of England in the world’s long - lasting world heritage meant that Serbia would be similar to the previous month of June, when the arrivals of children increased by 2.8 percent, with the fact that restaurants were now even more vulnerable.
The drop of 1.8 percent in the restaurant's arrivals in June has only increased in August.
The pubs and barons where the main drinking services have achieved much greater profits under the same conditions in relation to losses suffered by restaurants.
Pubs where the main food is served have also been injured by heat, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to get out for a drink.
In controlled pubs and bars, the sale of alcohol increased by 6.6 per cent over the month, and the sale of food by three per cent."
Paul Newman, RSM analyst for rest and recreation, said: "These results continue to be a trend we see from the end of the spring.
Time and impact of major social or sports events are still the biggest factors when it comes to sales on the external market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to struggle with difficulties, although sales of 4.8 per cent will be particularly painful because of constant pressure.
Long summer summer could not come in the worst time for local leaders serving food, and the time will show whether the moderate temperatures we experienced in the cologne would give us before we needed a move."
The total growth of sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly-opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown of the growth of slave brands.

One out of five children has secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents
Research reveals that one out of five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of “false Instas” page
The news has increased the fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main" account showing parents
One out of five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, open secret accounts on social networks that hide from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of “false Instas” accounts of users on the web site to share photos.
The news has increased the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they use a clear "main" account to show parents and at the same time have private accounts.
One mother who found her 13-year-old daughter on the secret Web site found a teenager who was moved by the other words “Follow me”.
A study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the HMC of independent schools showed that 40 percent of the students between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, half of which admitted to own private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "vote of athletes" in the Scottish athletic team
Elidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish athletic committee as an imperfect director at the annual administrative council.
Doyle is the most distinguished Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described this move as a great opportunity for those who lead sport to take advantage of its wide experience gained at international level during the past decade.
"Eilid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and World athletes' community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will be of great benefit by acting as a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be a sportsman's voice, and I hope I can really bring sports to Scotland."
The American, who won the race at 200 and 400 meters in 1996 at the game in Atlanta, from his total four Olympic gold, and now he's running a BBC expert, after the passing of the ischemist attack, he can't walk anymore.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I experienced a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it's only time to show me if I want to get better.
It was hard, but he recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today he is practicing agility!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!"
Shared online views on advertising for a publisher comparing mothers with cows
A company for the production of a publisher by its advertising that the mother who gives birth compares her children to the cows that the husband has raised has shared an opinion on the Internet.
In order to mark the launch of a product for which it is claimed to be "the first silent shipment of publishers in the world", Elvie announced an advertising inspired by an Iranian music video to show the freedom that a new publisher gives to mothers.
The four mothers dance in a state full of blues and cows with a song that reads: "Yes, I'm a husband, but you don't see any rap" and "If you haven't noticed, this is not a dream, it's my breast."
Then he said, "Sleep, pump, feed the baby, pump, pump, pump, take your ladies out."
However, advertising, published on the company's Facebook page, has raised controversy over the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video record has received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say that it illuminates the "dangerous" milk industry.
"It is a very bad decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they have to hire and work to produce milk, except for the children stealing a few days after birth," one person wrote.
The publisher Elvie is discrepancies in the breast-feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another person comments: “It’s understandable traumatized for the mother and the child.
But, yes, why don't you use them to advertise the publisher for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone added, "Tomorrow-free ads."
The other defended the advertising, in which one woman admitted that the song was “a joke. ”
"I think this is a genius idea.
If I had another drink, I'd have bought one.
Milking has made me feel like a cow.
She's a little crazy, but I got her the way she did.
This is a brilliant product," she said.
Another person commented: “This is entertainment advertising directed at mothers who deliver milk (often at their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like ‘ bread ’.
This is not advertising that praises or condemns the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were all dancing with discreet publishers located in the chest.
The concept of campaigns is based on the knowledge that many women who milk say they feel like cows.
Elvie's publisher, however, is completely silent, without a wire or pipes and is discreetly stuck into a breast-feeding chest, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even get out during delivery.
Ana Balarin, a partner and executive creative director of Mother’s agency, commented: “Elvie’s publisher is so revolutionary that it deserves courage and provocative launch.
The more parallel between women's and cows' show, we wanted to focus on giving attention and all of its challenges, while at the same time in a fun and reasonable way to demonstrate an incredible sense of freedom that the new publisher will bring.
This is not the first time Elvie's publisher got to the address.
During the London week fashion, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion bridge for designer Mart Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly transferred to a tent camp at the border with Texas
The number of migrant children detained has increased although the number of monthly crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the heavy rhetoric and policies imposed by the Tromp's administration made it difficult for children to settle under the sponsor's care.
Traditionally, most sponsors were themselves immigrants without documents and were afraid to risk their own ability to stay in the country by putting them out and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to be given fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, High Commissioner for Immigration and Customs, testified before the Congress that the agency arrested ten people who had reported for sponsoring a minor without a trace.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested were not registered in criminal records.
"Total 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of sponsors' homes in the country are illegal, and most of them are criminal strangers.
That's why we keep looking for those individuals," Mr. Albence said.
According to the authorities, with the aim of speeding up the procedure for children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of processing, not after 60 days, which was previously standard.
Many will appear through a video conference call, rather than personally, in order to remove their case for legal status before the moving court.
Those who do not meet the criteria for assistance will be deported soon.
According to workers' statements in the shelter and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, which is more likely to be severe or depressive, which can lead to violent disappearances or attempts to escape.
The prosecutors said that these concerns were expressed in larger objects such as Tornillo, where, because of his size, it is very likely that signs of child suffering will be seen.
They added that moving children to tentacles without time to prepare them emotionally or to greet friends can lead to the trauma that many children have already faced.
Syria orders American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualam also invited Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has lasted for eight years.
Moalam, also a prime minister deputy, said that the forces were on the Syrian soil illegally, in the face of the fight against terrorism, and that it would "consist with them and be done with them".
"They must withdraw immediately and inevitably," said the congregation.
Moulalem insisted that "war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, while millions have been without their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to "fight in this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed" by terrorist groups and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2000 soldiers in Syria, who are primarily training and counseling Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war of the country.
With regard to refugees, Mouale said that the conditions for their return were met and he blamed "some Western countries" for "screaming Iraqi fears" which urged refugees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to ease these returns," he said.
"They policy what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that it will not be helpful for the reconstruction of Syria until the political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war is concluded.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a Tampon zone in the last large rebel resort of Idliba created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented the massive attacks of the Syrian forces with Russia's support on the territory of which three million people live.
Moualem, however, pointed out that the agreement had "clear hands" and expressed hope that the military action would be directed to the Jedi, including the Nusra front fighter associated with Al-Qaidad, "which will be exploited".
Ambassador of the United Nations Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of government and opposition in order to establish a subsequent constitution for Syria and open a path to elections.
Mouale has set conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the desire for trust should be limited to "in the revision of the present constitution" and warned against harassment.
Why Trump's gonna win another mandate
According to that logic, Mr. Trump should win the re-elections of 2020 unless many liberal observers are likely to expect, opposition and scandal to close his presidency early.
What would undoubtedly be the most dramatic end of the presidency ever!"
There's no sign of a viewer's death right now.
Since 2014, there has been more than twice the impact on CNN and almost EUR 1.6 million on MSNBC since 2014.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in an attack term, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and the MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" show has been overestimated with almost 3.5 million viewers for the evenings of the main news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the ABC's drama “Designed Survivor”, about a government secretary who becomes president after the attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Scowell, author of comedy and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
It is remembered by a train taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He answered, "Because he laughs at me," said Mrs. Scowell.
There's a fun value in chaos.

When I arrived this week to Mr. Fleissa, in front of his house on the northern coast of the island of Caucasian was sundial at 80 degrees (about 27 °C), but he was inside and watched MSNBC and filmed CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face-to-face with the Senate Legal Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was about to end.
"I remember when we did all these crazy emissions in the past, and people said, 'This is the beginning of Western civilization'," said Mr. Fleiss.

Money goes out in the most uncertain middle-year election race for the Congress
It is not surprising that the 17th round of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the reconstruction of the convention districts that resulted in two candidates in the race for the same place.
This recently refurbished round of Pittsburgh construction points to democracy Conora Lamba which has won a place in the second round in special elections last spring.
Lamb competes against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th round of Pennsylvania, which is largely in conflict with the new 17th round.
The cards were re-examined after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were constitutionally cut for the benefit of the Republicans.
The new 17th round launched a campaign to finance the campaign between the main foreign financial fund collectors, the Committee collecting funds for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after the final victory in the wide follow-up special Christmas election for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This position has been held by Republicans for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump has won a round of 20 points.
Political analysts have given unknown preference to democracies.
The US considers whether to punish El Salvador for providing support to China and then withdraw
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Peking, with a small opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the management team of the Trumps organisation.
The officials of the State Department decided to call the US Diplomatic Mission Chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "new decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore", said journalist Heather Nauert.
However, sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million US$ in 2017 for, among others, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including the reduction of financial assistance and the target of restrictions, would be illness for the Central American country and high rates of unemployment and murder.
As the internal meetings have progressed, officials from North America and Central America have held a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity in order to continue on a similar gathering last year, which was considered to be a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
However, until mid-June, the senior officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and that, in fact, they had ceased any consideration of the El Salvador sanctions.
Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-November, as a sign of the importance of the administration attending the meeting, the diplomats said.
And three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further hard messages or sentences from Washington.
The White House spokesman, on behalf of Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions under the conditions of anonymity.
Their report confirmed an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next preparation could be the report of special researcher Robert Mueller on the possible Trump's execution of justice, which is now a very significant public evidence available.
Mr. Mueller, as reported, also focused his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign was secretly agreed with Russia as part of her attack on our elections.
If the majority changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in this body, just when he is ready to go again before the voter, and perhaps in the end with his jury.
There are a lot of these "if" and I don't want to suggest that Mr Truma's inevitable fall - even those similar to him in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German journalists were ready to launch a state attack on Hitler, only that the West opposed and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years that followed.
History revolves around such points of inflation, and the inevitable march of democracy is slowing down or late.
The Americans are now facing a few of these inflational points.
What should we do if Mr. Trump leaves a replacement of a state lawyer, Roda Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the news reported that last year, he has slowly presented the president's video and hoped that he could not serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says Tim's report is incorrect.
"How will we respond if a recent FBI investigation about Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or honest or if it is confirmed by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?"
And above all, will we vote in the mid-year elections for Congress that Mr. Trump will call for responsibility?
If we fall into these tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I believe we won't fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who deported to Auschwitz the same Nazi regime that once settled in my missionary home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to burn candles for a hat on that table with a brown cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid from Beča
The Rangers are on Thursday at Rapid's home in Bec, knowing that they will be defeated by Austrians, after an impressive campaign in Spain against Villarrela this month, to put in the bid position to qualify from the G Group of the European League.
The damage of the knee prevented the binder Graham Dorrass from appearing for the first time in the 2nd and 2nd season with Villarreol, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a drop-down desk for larger things.
"It was a good result for us because Willarreal was a good opponent," said 31-year-old.
"We went into the game believing we could achieve something and we pulled the point out.
We may eventually have stolen the game, but, generally viewed, the unsolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
Thursday is another big European night.
Let's hope we can win three points, but that's gonna be a hard game because they've had a good outcome in the last game, but with the support of the winner, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive outcome.
Last year was definitely hard, between everything that happened to my injuries and changes in the club alone, but now the government has a good feeling.
Boys are good and boys really enjoy; training is good.
Let's hope we can continue now, leave the past season behind us and be successful."
Women can't sleep because of the fear of peace
Despite the fact that researchers had a clear preconceived view of what concerns them, few people spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the researchers at the Nationalwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take steps to start a conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Security Council.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for giving care if you don’t express your wishes first.
Work with your counselor and your family to talk about where and how to take care, as your choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial adviser: Your consultant can also help you figure out how to pay these costs.
Your selection of long-term care funding may include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with money that will help you to cover these costs or self-sustainment with your own wealth while you have money.
Sort your legal documents: Prevent legal battles in the background.
Aggregate health representatives to identify a trusted person who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals are satisfied with your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Also consider giving plenty to manage your finances.
You want to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions in your name and to ensure payment of your accounts if you are not able.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation that requires urgent medical intervention and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please specify the details in the written schedule so that you will be ready.
"It's not just about finances, but who's the doctor?" asked Martin.
“What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that plan with your hands."

Poets and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a violent earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials arrived, and the number of deaths was expected to increase.
Since the communications have been interrupted, aid providers have not been able to obtain any information from Dondree's territory, a region north of Pala, which is closer to the peak of 7.5 degrees.
In Palau after the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Here are some of the key facts about Palau and Dondri, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palo is the main city of the province of Sulawesi, located at the end of the valley on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
Dodrea is a circle that extends over 300 km of the coast to the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The area, the administrative region below the border, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the province of Sulawesi, particularly the coastal region of Dodrea.
Nikal mines are also important in the countryside, but they are mainly concentrated in Morrow, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palau and Dodrea have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, he killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dondria.
Tsunami also struck West Dongheu 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Seizmic Pacific Fire Zone and is regularly discussed with the population.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004.: The great earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on the north of Sumatra on December 26 caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Acehu.
2005.: A series of strong earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra by the end of the summer and early spring.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 degrees hit southern Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, causing tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: The power of 7.6 degrees hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: The earthquake of 7.5 degrees hit one of the Isle of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis to reach ten feet [10 m] that destroyed ten villages and killed about 300 people.
2016.: The plague hit the region of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because it reminded people of the outbreak of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
This time it didn't get to the tsunami, but more than 100 people died after the collapse of the building.
2018.: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, where more than 500 people died, mainly on the northern side of the island.
Potre destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
The oldest son of Sare Palin was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President, Sare Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin (29), from the city of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for questioning in family violence, arrest of family violence and arrest warrants, is reported in a report published on Saturday by the state police officer Aljaska.
According to the police report, when a acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in Mat-Su custody and is held on an insecure bond of $500, KTUU reports.
He appeared at the trial on Saturday, where the issue of an explanation of the crime was explained as “unjust, of course,” the network reported.

He is also accused of breaking Class B, which is sentenced to one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time the criminal charges have been filed against Palina.
In December 2017 he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palina.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the vet court in Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of family violence, the arrest of family violence, and the possession of weapons in an alcoholized state that are related to the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her face.
Sara Palin criticized the veterinary group in 2016 after linking his son's violent behavior with PTSP after his work in Iraq.
Tsunami and poetry in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The explosion of 7.5 degrees caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been interrupted, and in the next days the number of deaths is expected to rise.
Potres hit the direct vicinity of central Sulawesi, north of the main city of Indonesia, Jakarte.
On social networks, videotapes are surrounded by videotapes showing the moment of attack.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspects for terrorist attacks in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death sentence for Sayfula Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York where eight people were killed in a rare sentence that has not been carried out in a state since 1953.
Saipov (30) reportedly used a truck to rent a home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle race along the West Side road in Donja Manhattan, where he hit the sands and bicycles that were found on his way to November
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip killed eight victims "amically" and "amically" caused a serious physical injury, according to the report of the intention to seek a death penalty, which was imposed in the southern part of New York.
Both of these points lead to the death penalty, in accordance with a court document.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal large jury of Saipov attacked a 22-point accused of eight murder and murder charges, which federal prosecutors usually use in cases of organised crime, violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "known planning and thinking," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as a "grunt, cruel and honest".
"Sayful Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Drake, Ariel Erlie, Hernan Ferruchia, Herna Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucca," says the report.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since New York's southern circle last processed the case of death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was finalized in a federal case in New York, 1953, when married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were killed after they were sentenced to a prison sentence for spying for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg's were killed on 19 June 1953 at an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of punishment in the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, that the police had told him.
Saipov told the authorities that after watching the ISIS videotape on his phone he was inspired to carry out an attack, he said in charge.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be carried out in his hospital room, and the police informed him.
He made it clear he wasn't guilty of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were "exposurely disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to seek death penalty, not to accept the confession of life in prison without the possibility of release, will only extend the tranche of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipovl's defense team previously asked the prosecutor not to ask for a death sentence.
Conservative Member of Parliament says NIGEL FARGE should be responsible for talks about Brexit
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilisate the National Army" today during a talk at a Conservative Conference.
The former Head of the Independent Party of the United Kingdom said that politicians had to "feel pressure" the Eurosceptics because one of Parliamentarians Therese May suggested that he should be held accountable for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative representative Peter Bonne said a return to Birmingham that the United Kingdom had so far "extended" that Mr. Farage was a secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May in resolving her deeply divided ranks highlights the remnants who join a special campaign against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain its compromise "Checkers" plan in the middle of the attack to reach Brexit, to join the rest of the EU.
The allies insisted that it would continue with the attempts to agree with Brussels despite the reaction and force Eurosceptics and Laburists to choose between its package and "kaos".
Mr. Bone said at a campaign "Leave Means Leave" in Solihul that he wanted to "reject the Chequers".
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have a title and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were the head, we'd be out by now," he said.
A member of parliament from Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must throw out the Chequers."
Confronting his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be born.
We want to bring our own laws into our country."
Mr. Bonne rejected the statement that the public opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and that they want to remain completely wrong is wrong."
Conservatives and supporters of Brexit Andrea Jenkins were also in trouble, talking to journalists, saying: “I just say: Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the broad public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually the ones who went out on the streets and chose us.
Please reject the Chequers and start listening."
In a stirring message, Mrs. May added: “The Prime Minister keeps his place of work when he fulfills his promise. ”
Farage told the audience that politicians must make themselves "feel pressure" if they are ready to ignore the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that's not gonna happen to you."
In a letter to the excited audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the edge of Brexit’s edition, to feel pressure.
We mobilize this country's national army that has given us victory in Brexit and we will not settle until we become independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the remains were marched through Birmingham before they held a double assembly in the city center.
The majority of activists have failed the transparency of "Torieves against Brexit" after the launch of this weekend's group.
Laburist Lord Adonis was afraid of conservatives for security problems that had been dealt with by the party's application during the opening of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all technology for the "Canada plus" plan for an unlimited state on borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete phase.
There's no good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "extremely consider" to apply for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that "the candidate will be considered to be a president" after the student's election.
Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future on Saturday in direct association with citizens in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trumpa, is running for re-election in the studies against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was Vice-President of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It's been in the center of speculation for a while to be able to resist the Tromp of 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon in Hollyoke was her 36th meeting with the citizens since Trump took over his duties.
The investigator asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren answered that it's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that's what we understand about a woman's head."

Baton Rouge's police published information on the arrest of Dytheon Simpson (20), at 11 a.m., at a press conference.
On Friday, they published a murder video, asking for help in identifying men from the footage.
Sims (20) was killed early Friday near the University of Southern.

Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of the world trial after his leader guarantees victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the team leader will "play a great role in the race".
From the start, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his team member.
The winner first went into the box and left Hamilton to get in the traffic at first, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes went into the box one round later and went out behind the Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after the action of the driver on the wheel because Ferrari was difficult to leave the free interior at the risk of staying after a double move in defense of the third crime.
Max Verstappen left the last row and was seven to the end of the first circle on his 21st birthday.
Then he conducted a large part of the race while he gave up his rubber to reach the fast finish and beat Kimia Raikconen for the fourth place.
He finally arrived in box on the 44th round, but he couldn't speed up his pace in the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen took the fourth place.
The day was hard because Valtteri's been doing a fantastic job all weekend, and he's the real gentleman who let me through.
Tim has done a really great job to achieve the formation finish," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad speech of the body.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday for her insistent that she did not release Christine Blasey Ford publicly accusing candidates for the Supreme Court of Britta Kavanaugh for sexual abuse.
Turning to a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly forget the testimony of the Forum before the Senate's Legal Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that people were “bad, mean and unfair”.
"The only thing that can happen is the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean, cruel and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at advertising and screening information in the public, and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it.'
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you left any information?
Remember her answer... did you leave the document in public - 'aye, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.'
Wait a minute.
Did we... no, we didn't," he added imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein in August sent a letter with details of Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and he went through earlier in June - but Feinstein claimed that the information had arrived from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's instructions, I didn't leave her story to the public," Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"She begged me to keep her secret, and I kept her secret, which she asked for."
However, her appeal did not come to the approval of the president, who, at the meeting on Saturday evening, commented: “Let me tell you something - it was a very bad speech of the body.
Maybe not, but I've never seen a burning body talk in my life."
Continuing its defence of the Supreme Court candidate, which three women accused of sexual abuse, the president suggested that the charges be used for their own purposes.
"They are determined to return the government at every price.
You see the evil, the madness, they don't care who will hurt, who must be ignored to come to power and control," said the president, transferred Mediaite.

The air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers in the aircraft escape traffic
The air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared to be a hero after he died while ensuring safe air traffic with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed, and many were killed as a result of a massive earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and caused tsunamis.
Strong earthquakes continue to plague the area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues running away to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his work place in the control tower of Mutira Sis Al-Jufri, which was heavily floating.
He stayed to ensure safe landing of the Batik Air aircraft at flight number 6321, which was then on the track.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought he was running.
He moved to the hospital later.
Johannes Sirait, a spokesman for the Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transfer him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Our hearts are ashamed of this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are afraid that the number of dead could reach thousands of people, and the state disaster relief agency says there is limited access to the cities of Dothrei, Sigija and Boutongo.
"It is believed that the number of deaths continues to increase, since many bodies are still under pollution, and to many it cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the Agency's spokesman.
The waves that reached the height and blew up to three feet [6 m] of Pala, which will hold the mass deck on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “The emergency aid is coming every minute of the body's import.
The government is desecrating clean water.
They're stealing small shops everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is driving through the lives of survivors, but we do not know what will be found there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be a lot worse."
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo admitted on Sunday in Pala and told the military: “Please all of you work day and night to complete all the evacuation duties.
Are you ready?" CNN report.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lomboka, where more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is running like a missing man after the plane crash in the valley
The aircraft company owned by the owner of the aircraft which has fallen into the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now claims that one man is running away as a missing person, after it has been said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew members are safely evacuated from the aircraft that is tonatoo.
In his statement, Air Niugini stated that from Saturday afternoon I can't enter the track one of the passengers.
The air carrier has agreed to cooperate with local authorities, hospitals and researchers in the search for the person concerned.
The air carrier did not respond immediately to requests for additional information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save the rest of the passengers and crew after the plane fell into the water while trying to land into the Chuuk island's airport.
The officials said on Friday that seven people were transferred to the hospital.
The airport company reported that six passengers were kept in the hospital on Saturday, and that everyone was in a stable state.
What caused the fall and the exact outcome of the event remain unknown.
The airline company and the American Navy reported that the aircraft landed in a trailer near the bridge.
Some fathers thought the plane had lost his gun.
Bill Jaynes, a traveler from America, said the plane was very low.
"That's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to pass through the water that led them to the exit in case of the danger of the plane that hit them.
He said the studs were panicking and screaming, and he suffered less headaches.
A U.S. Navy reported that sailors working near the port repair site also helped save using a boat to launch people's transport to land before the aircraft hit about 30 meters of water.
Air Safety Network data indicate that in the accident of aircraft carriers registered in PNG in the last two decades, 111 people died, but none of them were included in Air Niugini.
An analyst presents a time review of the night in which a woman burned alive
On Saturday, the Commission concluded a case in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst of the U.S. Ministry of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in the field of reporting data analysis.
Poroti described how he used his cell phone data to put the case on the move of 29-year-old witness Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he got the location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers at night when he was murdered, which was contrary to his previous claims, carried by The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was located at the same location as Chambersin at the time he was with his own friend Michael Sanford, the police went to investigate Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors questioned whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said that he “responded because his truck was in Nashville. ”
Another disability was what Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The cell phone data showed that they only met for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis, a certain time after Chambersin's death, deleted her messages, calls and contact details from the phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense should start the final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.

Another nigger?
Dadil from New York charges a couple for rejection after the "racist" message
Dadilla from New York complains a couple of cases of discrimination after she received a wrong-directed message from her mother, which she called her "one more black."
A couple deny that they are racist, comparing the charge with the "excussion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment when after her arrival on the first working day of 2016 she found out that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"No more CRNKINY," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a letter to his wife.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After acknowledging her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in a "failing" situation, and left Mrs. Maurice because she claims that theirs was then an already former American nanny who was doing his job badly, and that she was expecting the Philippines to transfer New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one day's work, and then she went home.
Now Maurice charges a couple for a discount and seeks a discount of $350 per day for a period of six months for which she was initially engaged, although without a contract.
"I want to show them that I can't do such things," she said on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple argued that they were racist, saying that it was reasonable to do the end of Maurice's employment, because of the fear that she would later be unable to believe because of her injuries.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her message.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said husband Joel Plasco for Post.
"But would you believe your children's person whom you were rude, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco said that his wife had only two months of birth leave after the birth of the child and that she was in “a very difficult situation. ”
"You will accuse someone who is in such a situation
"That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned a couple on social networks, criticising them for their behavior and logic.
The Paddington publishers were afraid that readers would not be confronted with the bear who speaks, found in the new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says: “It’s hard to put the book in someone’s skin for the first time.
It's very funny what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She says that her father, who worked as a BBC photographer before the little fat bear inspired him to write a book, was optimistic when his work was rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was filled with happiness and sorrow after his death last year.
About Paddington, described as “a very important member of the family”, she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
"He was quite a man and he wasn't a praiser," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, everything came to life as someone to achieve his own child: you're proud of him even though none of it really is your job.
I think Paddington's success has been seen that way.
Although it was about his work and his imagination, the reward has always been attributed to the exclusive Paddington."
My daughter died, and we had to forgive ourselves by phone.
After surgery, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors sincerely tried to save her life.
"He called over regularly to say it's really bad and to believe he won't get out," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad invited me to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to forgive her.
What I did.
“ Tashi, ” I said, “I love you very much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
The medications that doctors gave her to maintain her heart’s function were slowly lost and left her body system.
She died a little before she was loaded, and then everything stopped.
I just had to sit and wait knowing what's going to happen.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it all in my head."
Last of all, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who had been in mourning for the loss of her daughter, had fallen into the plane with the rest of the passengers - who had not been aware of the experience she had passed through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I put my head down, and my tears all the time, they fell down on my face.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt a strong sense of judgment against Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Women's messages in mourning at the bridge with the aim of preventing suicide
Two women who were left without loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put cards on a large bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, son of Mrs Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want no parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis (45), who lives in Lydney, said her son was a cook with an early eight-year-old who was waiting for a career career.
"Everyone remembered him for his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill every room with joy."
Before his death, however, he left his job because he was in “a really dark state. ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found a brother after you took this life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly worried that this will have a negative effect."
Mrs. Davis came to the idea with the cards "to let people know that there is someone you can go and talk to, even if he's a friend.
Don't sit in silence and you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, his partner who was 15 years old, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt sad, depressed or anything like that," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas he was on his own bottom when the children opened gifts, he didn't see them in his eyes, nor did he want anything else."
She said that his death had been a tragedy for them, but that they had to translate it: “It leaves a big hole in the family.
Let's go.
But we will continue to fight."

The future of Bretta Kavanaugh depends on the end of the FBI's investigation
"I thought we might be able to unify a little unity if we were really able to get something like what he asked for in a temporary and extensive limited investigation," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would "resist" in the midst of the cornered foreign blockade.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican allies want an FBI investigation?
Their difficulty is triggered by the moment's choice.
The mid-year elections come in only five weeks, on Saturday 6th if, what is expected, Republicans are not doing well, then they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to bring the desired man to the election for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush continued to call the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report?
He will vote in Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes in Senate, which would enable the Vice-President, Mike Pence, to pass a decisive vote and confirm his position in the Supreme Court.
Number of escapes from North Korea's 'back' under Kim' leadership
The number of escapes from North Korea fell after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, South Korean legislator said.
Calling for data from the United Kingdom Ministry of the South Union, Park Byeong-seug said there was 1127 escapes last year compared with 2706 during 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors are stricter controls on the border crossing between North Korea and China and more taxes paid by thieves to people.
Pyongyang didn't comment publicly.
Most of the escapes from the north finally received South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to prevent than a highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between two Koreas.
China's escape is considered illegal to migrants, not refugees, and often resorts to violence.
The relations between the North and the South which are still technical in the war have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of two countries met in Pyongyang during talks focusing on the remaining negotiations on denuclearization.
This followed a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trumpa and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broad sense to work for the liberation of the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, Ri Yong, North Korean Foreign Minister, charged the US sanctions that they have not made any progress since then.
"Without any trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and it does not take us to be the first to be disturbed under such circumstances," said Mr. Ri in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Kavanaugh "historic", says he is incapable of serving at the Supreme Court
The opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court Judge Bretta Kavanaugh "historic" and said that because of his temperature he was unable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't but not think that a woman would, if she had ever acted that way, call it 'historical'," Pelosi described his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally deplored the claim that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotionally, occasionally shouting and laughing while discussing his family and school years.
He also strongly condemned the democracies in the committee, calling charges against him a "great and coordinated round-up" that organized liberal anger that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not participate in the Supreme Court's work because he showed that he had prejudice against democracy.
"I think he is disqualifying himself with such statements and ways of attacking Mrs Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
The question is whether they will try to call Kavanaugh if it is confirmed, and if the democracies get most of the House of Representatives, Pelosi has stopped.
"I'll tell you the next time he doesn't speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it's not only possible to be in the Supreme Court, but not in the court at which he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently the Judge of the Federal Court of Appeal in the Colombia District.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about the potential Kavanaugh's decisions against the Act on Accessory Care or the law on the transfer of the Prostique from Roe's procedure against Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings for confirmation, Kavanaugh raised questions as to whether he would reconsider some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It's not time for a historical, forced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Is that not wonderful'," Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
Justifiable criticism, anger that has been collected for months and years can't be eliminated without payment.
"We cry when we're angry," said Mrs. Steine 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual. What do you think?"
She continues: “A woman who was once an executive director and who said how she cried when she was upset but developed a technique that, when she was upset and started to cry, the person she was talking to said: ‘ You may think I’m sorry because I’m crying.
I'm mad."
And then she went on.
And I thought it was great."
Suspension is allowed as an exit for anger, partly because they are mistakenly understood.
One of my most clear memories of one of the first jobs, in the office where the men dominated, is how it was, once when I cried because of the inexhaustible heat, an old woman  preacher who was always a little scared . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .)))))))) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .))))))))))))))))). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ....
"Don't ever let him see you crying," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy because they'll think you've been shot."
Patricia Schroeder, now a Democratic Congressional from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extraterrestrial affair on the Monkey Business boat and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason why she would not consider the idea of candidates for president.
"It wasn't a well-thought decision," she told me through a smile 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and they certainly didn't need another one.
Someone called them "Snögügüller and Seven Battalion."
Since the campaign was already slowed down, it stayed with the collection of funds, and it was said it wouldn't go into the race if it didn't collect $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her clients, who gave her $1,000 for men, only gave her $250.
"Do they think I have a break?" she asked.
While she said she was not going to start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions of the people who supported her, the frustration of the system that made it difficult to collect money and the goal of choosing instead of the delegates, and the anger of the sexist who insisted on it.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Schroeder's media reaction to her.
"You'd think Klenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what would put on my memorial.
"It's stuck."
How a trade war between the US and China can be good for Beijing
The beginning of a trade war between the United States and China voted out and, while the battle is far from over, the gap between the countries can be from the use of Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, American President, was the first warning this year, stressing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant scalation in this week appeared with new tariffs that affected products worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion dollars), in fact ravaging half of all slaves coming to the United States of China.
Peking has come back in some way, and recently it has been imported from five to ten percent to 60 billion dollars of American slave.
China promised the US to respond to the strike, and the second largest global economy will certainly not be delivered soon.
The withdrawal of Washington could be achieved by the release of requests, but public obedience to the US would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, US military pressure can provide long-term positive support to China by reducing the interdependence of two economies.
"The fact that a fast political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the start of economic flows in both countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a strategic thinker who focused on Asia at the New American Security Centre.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of a refugee, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for voluntary return of refugees and appeals for aid in a restored country that has destroyed war for more than seven years.
Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouale said how conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the field is more stable and safer thanks to progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas of destroyed terrorist attacks in order to establish a normal situation.
Now all the conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were directed to their daily lives and existence are met.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mouelem said that the Syrian regime would be better able to get help in the restoration of the devastated country.
However, he pointed out that he would not accept legal aid or the aid of a country that was sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe won Ryder's buy in Paris
The team Europe won the Ryder Cup 2018, winning the US final result of 16.5 ↑ 10.5 in Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times on the European soil so far and has not won Ryder's purchase in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again while the Danish captain Thomas Bjorna team reached 14.5 points that were needed to win the United States.
American stars Phil Mickelson, who suffered during almost the entire tournament, sent a ball in the water at the first strike, leaving the sword Francesc Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shines in all rounds and becomes one of four players who have ever reached 5-0-0 since the 1979 tournament began this format.
American Jordan Spietha fired Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, the lowest ranked player of the European boys, with 5&4.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 of English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The eight Reuters purchases, Spanish Sergio Garcia, have become European with the greatest victory in the tournament with the winning 25.5 points in the career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop tears.
The year was hard.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy that I won the bath again.
I'm glad I could help," said Garcia, full of emotions after the European victory.
He carries the ball to his cousin John Ramu who won a legendary American golfer on Sunday, Tiger Woods, result 2&1.
"I feel incredible pride over the triumph of Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four shots in France and now he has a record of 13-21-3 in Ryder.
The unusual statistics of one of the biggest players of all time, who won 14 headlines, are right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find a way out, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the top golf all the time.
After the disappointment of his team, American captain Jim Furyk said: “I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
At a certain point, we have been opposing Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm gonna take Thomas's hat off.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA America and our Board of Ryder, so we'll go on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take the cap off people.
We're overplayed."
