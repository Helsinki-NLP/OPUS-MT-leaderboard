President Vladimir Putin of Russia has signed the Act on Administrative Responsibility for the violation of the date and order of payment of goods (work, services) in procurement for public and municipal needs.
This law is designed to address the very urgent problem of failing to fulfil its obligations to contractors in the implementation of public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation where entrepreneurs could not receive payment for public and municipal contracts already completed was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the Attorney-General of the RF to take the issue of special control.
Since businessmen themselves were unable to deal with unskilled contractors who had not been financed by contracts, all tried to remove their obligations to pay and included illegal conditions in treaties.
The problem was system-wide in the country.
Since 2015, 9.7 thousand submissions have been submitted for the protection of the right of entrepreneurs to pay for public prosecutorial orders, and 4.5 thousand officials have been brought to administrative level 533 to the investigating bodies for the organization of procedural checks and 46 of them have been prosecuted.
As a result, more than 66 billion rubles were owed to entrepreneurs.
As a result, these huge amounts have been reduced far beyond the payment of multibillion-dollar contracts.
On the basis of the debt, numerous, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs have resulted in a lower amount.
Here's a very specific case.
The leader of a small company won a competition for social transport services in several million rubles.
A person has put all his means of transport, has fully fulfilled his obligations, but has not received the money in the course of time.
As a result, the growing financial commission of payments, taxes, credit would have led to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur had not sought help from the procurator.
The problem has now been maximized in a number of regions.
However, as at the first half of 2017, the total debt on public and municipal contracts identified by prosecutors of the Russian Federation ' s entities was approximately 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to be critical, the prosecutor is working in the anti-crisis management regime.
The Attorney-General personally attends meetings with representatives of the local authorities, where all prosecutors are aware of the violations and measures to remedy them immediately.
Such operational meetings have already been held in Yaroslav and Ekaterinburg this year.
A qualitative improvement in public procurement will be possible in the implementation of Federal Law No. 189-FZ "To amend the Russian Federation ' s Code on Administrative Offences in the establishment of the administrative responsibility of law enforcement officers for the breach of the term and order of payment of goods (work, services) in the procurement of public and municipal needs", which was signed last week by the President of Russia.
The draft law was drawn up by the Russian Minority Development of Russia on the initiative of the Genocorator.
The new law supplements the Russian Federation ' s Code on Administrative Offences, which provides for a fine of 30 000 to 50 000 rubles for the violation of the term and order of payment of goods, works and services in public and municipal procurement.
And if an official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for the same offence, he is expected to be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure the application of these new legislation in practice.
The Civil Rights Protection Group announced a movement warning in Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of the Advancement of the Colored People has issued a warning to the colouring people travelling in Missouri, due to the discriminatory policies of the state and attacks on the racist island.
The Group ' s statement is: “A warning to the travelling National Association to promote the progress of the colouring population, which, by 28 August 2017, calls upon the African Travellers, the guests and citizens of the State of Missouri to be particularly cautious and to exercise greater caution when travelling by state in connection with a number of suspicious developments on a racist island that had recently taken place throughout the state and here. ”
According to the National Association for the Promotion of the Advancement of the Colored People, the prevention of the movement of a group has created a recently adopted law in Missouri, which has made it difficult for people to overcome discrimination-related demands and that state law enforcement authorities often select their minority objects disproportionately.
“You are under human rights violations.
They remain on the streets because of the color of the skin, they kill and kill them," said the Kansas City Star, Rod Chepell, president of the National Association for the Promotion of the Progress of the Colored People of Missouri.
"We hear complaints often as before."
This is the first warning of such a kind as has been announced by the United States State.
The group was involved in incidents such as the humiliation of black students on racial grounds at the University of Missouri and the death of 20-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he had finished the gas during his trip to the state, and the police arrested him, without accusing him of committing a crime.
The warning also mentions the recent report of the Prosecutor-General of the State of Missouri, which states that it is likely that black drivers will be stopped at 75 per cent higher than whites.
“The aim of warning people of the situation and of warning their relatives and friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri,” said Chapel.
“People must be prepared in such a way or otherwise, whether they will take their money to jail or report to relatives travelling the territory of the state.”
According to the latest FBBD reporting programme on hate crimes, 100 hate crimes were registered in Missouri in 2015 and a State of sixteen in the State under such violations.
Prevention of movement is also a response to the new law of the State of Missouri, after which it will be more difficult to raise cases against a legal person in connection with housing or labour discrimination.
Previously, the American Union for Civil Liberties (ACLU) had announced warnings for travellers on Texas and Arizona after these countries had adopted new immigration control laws, which required local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which, according to ACLU, had to increase the number of racial checks.
Prevention of movement is usually issued by the State Department to other countries, but public organizations have recently responded to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people were killed as a result of a police patrol strike in Egypt
An unknown police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna reports Reuters with reference to the Ministry of the Interior of Egypt.
During the shooting, two people, including one police officer, were killed, and three people were injured.
All the wounded are sent to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two of the men in the armed machine were opened by law enforcement officers.
One of the criminals was arrested and the other was able to hide.
Rosturism upholds the law on the abolition of free-of-charge baggage for non-return aircraft
The Head of Rosturism Oleg Safonov, in the RBC, stated that "positive" concerns the adoption of the law on the abolition of free transport of baggage by non-vote aircraft.
"It is necessary to create conditions in which a person who has no baggage can buy a package ticket unless he has it," he stressed (the TAS quote).
Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the threat of citizens, it was not necessary to pay for the carriage of clothes and mobile phones in hand.
"It would be right to calm down all our citizens and tourists and to say it, to say that it's upstairs, to the radio, to the phone, to the airport or even to any computer of the relationship," said the head of Rosturism.
Former Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law that provides for the right of airlines to exclude the standard of free transport of baggage at the airport.
The fact is that the airlines can determine the number of locations and bags included in the non-return tariff.
Vladimir Putin ordered to eliminate the pollution of Baikal
President Vladimir Putin of Russia at the Bicola Protection Meeting reported that in recent years significant areas of the lake have been affected by extreme pollution.
He instructed that sources of funding, plans and enforcement should be identified for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also ordered a thorough reculture of contaminated areas.
"We must also deal with the objects that continue to work here, the clean weapons of most of them are carried out," said the President, "REA News."
He also added that the General Prosecutor General of Russia should carry out an environmental review.
He said that there were problems in the area of the lake with the emergence of natural disasters and a number of environmental violations by respiratory organizers.
"I would like to stress this: not all of us have to verify, but we need to know the measure here, but that is, illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures," he stressed.
Previously, the Geneva Office reported on the reduction of fisheries stocks in Lake Baikal and suggested an increase in the number of facilities under environmental supervision.
Remember, on 15 June, Vladimir Putin made a direct statement on the need to amend legislation in order to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural areas of special protection.
The people of the island of Olyong, which is part of the Baikal natural territory, have been informed about the problems of economic activity.
The head of Minprerod Sergei Donsk immediately proposed a solution to the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baykal area, but the Government of Burundi recalled that such changes were not sufficient, as restrictions were linked to a number of regulations.
Earlier in the Miniconomies had proposed a solution to the problem by amending the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
A New Temple in South Korea
In the village of Sosova, members of the community of indigenous minority peoples of North Rhine-Westphalia, together with the inhabitants of the Berezian region, are participating in the construction of the Orthodox temple in honor of Saint Nicholas the Great.
Its location is a river bank, the temple will be well-known, so it will serve the fish as a means of travel.
According to community representatives, construction work has already been completed this year, and now the dome has been established, there are churches.
The REB fleet was accompanied by transport.
The temple is known as the Holy Nicholas the Great, since it is considered to be the Orthodox Church as the patron of travelers, including fishermen.
And in the universe there is a fishing industry that gives its inhabitants work and destroys them.
The local people wait for the temple to open its doors, and the children even write about it as a local feature.
Disneyland with a death penalty.
Why are the laws in Singapore applicable?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in a cold room in open air.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette for another, while the cakes are carefully stored in an office of iron.
After the end of the session, the businessman is sent to the nearest urn - up to a hundred meters - and he throws out the pipes there.
The tax for the mouse in the public area - 500 local dollars - reported Chang.
You know, I've just had a reflex from my childhood: I can't throw a fan out of the envelopes on the bridge, they're out of the way.
And now it's all over the video camera.
And indeed, Singapore's trottoriums in the center of the city are clean, literally in the museum.
Chang relates that three months ago his 18-year-old son, a neighbor, drew up the graphs of an old colonial building.
The court recognized the boy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to trial.
What?
Imagine yourself.
He got ten shots of a wooden stick on his balls and spent a week in prison.
We don't have a lot of physical punishments.
As Singapore's high standard of living and incredibly serious laws are combined, the AIF is on the ground.
There's no one here who's going to cancel the death penalty, explains attorney Victor Lee Hong.
The Government has long held the view that both the European Union and the United States have seen it.
If a person carries a lot of drugs or sells them, he has a visa.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi Airport: he was pregnant with 400 grams of cocaine.
In his defense, the Australian Prime Minister was threatened by sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the pope of Rome.
However, the boys at the same time did everything in their power.
Since then, drug dealers have pushed our country away.
The case is as follows: Singapore states that the laws are required to comply with the mandate of the SBI, not only the humble and the poor.
It doesn't matter who you are as a millionaire, vice president, famous artist or resident of the Euro Union.
The option in this case is one: if you get a little cocaine, you'll get bigger.
When you go to Singapore and you meet the dog warnings tables everywhere, you just wonder how many bans are in this city!
For example, the nutrient resin is sold only in the apocalypse and can be bought strictly on prescription (!) by a doctor.
The tourist is not allowed to take a shower, but it should be added to the "resin" in the metre, a fine of $1,000 in local dollars.
Four days ago, I met two people with white tables on their hair, "I'm tired."
In addition to the stick, the urticaria is often referred to as "relatives in the yard": a week to pick up parks and beaches.
Six thousand rubs are paid by the “crime” who has forgotten to drink water in a public toilet, and while trying to address a small need in the elevator of the house, a special detector is working to block the door and send a signal to the police.
Among all exegetical laws are prohibitions on the street, public performance of the song, and even overcrowding of the room (!): it is believed that the pool of water is attracted to the rooms.
In order to avoid fires, smokers are not allowed to carry a beam in the metre, or they are injured by 5,000 Singapur buffs.
In general, the idea is: as you try, you're bound to break something.
This is not the case - trying to convince me of Muhammad Kabir Kadjar, the owner of the local jurisdiction.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on books, and in the last twenty years, I haven't seen anyone get involved in their violations.
Why do they stay?
So the citizens didn't get tired.
The compliance with the basic rules has been observed without delay.
For example, if a minor sells cigarettes in a casino, he will be punished all over the store: the owner pays a huge sum, the offender himself will be hit by the arrows on the back, and the sellers will also be shot and thrown into prison.
That's because of so many serious crimes laws in Singapore.
Is that right?
In the 1970 ’ s, we had been making chaos on the streets - automobiles ignored lights, walked as they wanted, sat down on the street drinking.
After the tax year, everything was calmed down.
Now the driver, who has been drinking whiskey, knows that if they stop, the police don't leave for the loan, they'll pay for the cost of the apartment and they'll be fined for years.
Many foreigners of the city-state in South-East Asia seem to be diverse.
In 1993, American writer William Gibbson called Singapore "Disneiland with a death penalty" -- a guest from the United States who had brought the total wealth of the inhabitants, a clean airport and a cultural nature.
Such things are not natural; they are artistic, and they should not be so in principle.
The first few days in Singapore and you're really afraid to throw a book on a tractor, you'll be able to catch it if you're in the subway with the sea.
But then you're going to the Small India area, and the second is the "sharp of the template": plastic stairwells are thrown in the bus stop.
"How is that?" you wonder.
And that's how Singaporeans laugh.
It's all right.
Not every kind of crime is known to you, but you must know that if you are called upon, you will not desist, because you have violated the law.
Most of all, it's enough for a man to take care of himself properly.
Of course, Singapore's authority is completely authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnam I moved very cautiously - motorcyclists often pick up from the hands of smartphones and camera tourists.
In the centre of Paris, there are lots of garbage and a request.
Not everyone's trying to throw a mouse in the urine on our streets.
Singapore has become the most peaceful, clean and safe city on Earth, thanks to the collection of dragons and innocents.
You're thinking.
Such a human nature: remember, and in Russia, no one was involved in the roll until the strike.
Although Singapore's chief is not tax, it is voluntary compliance with the laws.
And we have to think that in Russia people would also be happy in clean streets, there's no bridges in the subway, and they would welcome the arrest of those who travel the elevator with the public toilet.
These are physical punishments, thanks, no need.
In the rest of Singapore's laws, at least they stand to be seen.
Nothing holy?
Now the White House of Trampa is headed for the Statue of Freedom.
The most reliable sign of change in the regime is when it starts to fight the stats.
The Americans understand this not less than all the others - from this point of view, the theatre of Saddam Hussein's status at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Government of Trampa, no doubt knew what he had done when he had taken a symbolic tour of the State of Freedom during a serious dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosto of the president ' s proposals for the sharp reduction of legal migration.
We're honest, Miller didn't try on his own.
The benefits of the owners of the shipyards and artists representing the Statue of Freedom would have been denied if he had tried to do so.
But he tried its meaning, especially the meaning that it was written in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed when the texts of Emma Lazarus were added to the chest.
As Miller said to Acost, "I don't want to go deep into history here, but the status of freedom is... the symbol of American freedom, which brings peace.
What you're talking about has been added later and is not part of the original Statue of Freedom."
Miller correctly explained the facts, but as he himself said, it's actually not about history.
This is about the present sound of Lazarus words that are the only ones in which the State invites not any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your standing, your poor, / your troops wishing to free up, / the unfortunate exodus of your fragile borders."
I've never seen the "unlucky polls" on our screens.
Miller didn't do literature, he made it clear that these people don't expect to be in the Americas.
This debate on the meaning of the status is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is indeed a debate on the meaning of America.
Lazarus and her friend, who fought to put her word around the statue after her death, were very well aware of what was being done by a perfectly political act.
The culture was intended to mark the link between the French and American republics through the banal classic image of the woman of Freedom.
Lazarus changed her mind: the female figure is no longer abstract, and she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name, Mother of the Eghan.
The combination of stimulating and imagery was a devastating feminist movement and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, they were right to change it back.
Gromoglan Rash Limbo, his son John Cristier, who came to the entrance of Trampa, argued in 2010 that Freedom does not invite anyone, rather it is an early non-conservative who carries the flame of America under the shadow of the world: " Freedom is going ahead.
It holds the flag of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
Fakel doesn't need to open the way to the United States."
In contrast to Limbo's civilization, it's actually falling to the point.
The meaning of the statue depends exclusively on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as she could see potential, unhappy but full hopes of people on board ships after long and often heavy ships.
This means that we literally look at the world with the eyes of people who are looking for refuge and a chance for a better life.
The article responds to the hopes and hospitality that they hope to hear.
And, of course, it's not the prospect that Miller and Trump ever want to admit.
They need no light from the path of hatred, which is the only source of power.
2017 World Championship: Nil Blake highly prizes the Scottish members of the UK Assembly.
Elid Doyle remembers the time when there were only two Scots in Britain.
Nil Blake, director of the Federation's easy-to-flight athletes, said that a total of 16 people from Scotland gathered at the World Championship would make “a significant contribution to the game of the team”.
The record number of Scottish light aircraft was selected at the beginning of the 2017 London Championship on Friday.
Blake believes that in Scotland there is "something special" and that the United Kingdom's easy-to-fly athlete should take this into account.
"We know this and we try to understand and support it until they have the potential," Blake said.
"I spoke to people at the Scotland Sports Institute, and they think it's about what they did.
The Scottish Federation believes that they have to work because of what they have done.
The British Federation is an easy athlete: with what they've done, they have to work.
And people on the street think the same way.
I don't know why things have been going so wrong, but that's a lot harder."
Some of the Scots are demanding medals, including Laura Mur and Andrew Bachert, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at 5,000 metres away; and Elid Doyle has chosen his captain.
"Elyde shames.
Her capital thing was great," says Blake.
“Many of the easy-to-flights, regardless of whether they are or not, and from where they live or are trained, have come out of this room with pride and a tendency to win.
The passions and sincere feelings that Elyde has put into it have been remarkable.”
The owner of the silver medal of the Society's Championship, which will run 400 m from obstacles at its fifth World Championship, says 16 Scottish people in Britain are “unbelievable”.
The previous record of the number of Scottish people at the World Championships was equal to seven in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Myr, who is in the middle of the race, is on his way to the middle of the race and who has won five British and two European records last year.
She's leaving at 1500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Har, who is going to take part in the distance at 1500 m, is another Scottishman who should be taken into consideration: behind him was a successful season in which the election talks of the British Assembly and the annual meetings were won.
Doyle recalls his first world champion when, in addition to her only chess team, Li McConnel was the only chess player in the team.
The captain of the team says that she is “unbelievably proud” because not only her colleagues have come to the meeting, but in some cases they will demand medals and fight for the final.
"The head of the collection is elected by other members of the team, so it was, in any case, a great honor, but knowing that your friends voted for you and you, it was a very special thing for me," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scottish people who have come to the meeting.
This shows how much we got.
And they're all easy-to-do planes that'll be going to fall on the five-point.
What about my Captain's words?
Yeah, I think she was bad.
I just noticed that it was very exciting for us to take care of the World Championship.
So this is just about how important it is to get patient support and to use what we are going to do at the Olympic Stadium.
I've got another chance to get into his arena and participate in meetings, and the atmosphere will just be remarkable."
Blogging on Facebook: You don't have to go to public office unless you're ready to hear the criticism from the voters
The founder of our country understood that such a critical pressure.
The Americans loved George Washington, but that did not prevent them from criticising him for all of his internal policies and his political principles.
The criticism of him, of course, broke.
But he didn't hit his mouth with his criticism.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "We can take the freedom of speech and we, the deaf and the blind, lead as a sheep to war."
Now I'm going to go to Governor Maryland Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
The following Hogans blocked and starposts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the U.S. Union of Civil Liberties gave it to the court.
The undersigned Governors called this search useless, and comments on the Internet were written in the spirit of “no” and “no”.
"It's just Facebook," many say.
But it's important, too.
And that's especially important when it comes to Hogan's guy.
He is an amazingly popular republican governor in the state's democratic favor.
He's in the second place in the ratification of the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not an open reaction.
He demonstrated a strong hand in the administration of the state and commitment to its principles.
It also uses Facebook as the primary means of communication with its voters and with the arrows to show its skin on its page after head chemotherapy.
That is why to block people who come to the governor's side, which is declared as a public forum and run by the tax administration, is unnecessary and ultimately worthwhile.
In the Washington Post interview, the press secretary Amelia Ches protected the governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments is simply their moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolleys, spammers and hysterics that damage the Internet.
"Post" spoke to some of the real people who blocked Hogan.
And that's the real people, not the trolls, the teacher, the businessman, the pastor, who are addressing their chosen leaders.
They all say that their comments were honorable, content-free and not gross.
The pastor quoted the Bible, calling it the Hogan Catholic.
Lawyer Lakschmi Sharma Ramana from Bouai, Maryland, did not express hatred but asked for a crime on the ground of hatred.
"I wrote an effective comment that I was disappointed by the lack of response to the crimes committed on the ground of hate and other recent news," she wrote in part of the comments to the article "Post".
“I also do not like the idea that when many people leave comments on the same subject, some sometimes say that it is so short as to admit that they are dealing with a large group of disadvantaged citizens.”
The fact that the underprivileged Governors call the "concentrated spam-attack", others would probably be called "the active life position".
In the era of Facebook it is easy to edit your image simply by blocking criticism or making negative comments.
This is much less painful than before when people were required to send, collect, and burn newspapers with critical goods or arrest and torture protestors.
But that's the level of what's going on right now, just in the number.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for refusing to listen to Facebook and other websites.
President Trampu was asked by Twitter users who were banned in his Twitter account.
One of the first reverse decisions on this topic was adopted this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. District Judge of Alexandria, James K. Kecheris, President of the Watch Tower of the Society of Laudon violated the First Amendment by blocking the elector in his Facebook account.
In Kentucky, the Republican Governor, Matt Bawein, made a claim to the American Union for the protection of civil freedom for his conduct on Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington, the age of available mail costs was about the same as today's Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers grew sharply, and the authors of anonymized letters strongly violated their authority.
Even then, Washington had a case with anonymous trolls.
People under the headings "Juricula", "Vallerius", "Beliseris" and "Portius" wrote letters to Washington's solution.
According to the historical documents collected online by the document George Washington, his office was seized by applications critical of his position on the Treaty on friendship, trade and shipping.
But he didn't try to keep them secret.
Freedom of speech, of conscience and expression is indeed on the basis of our State.
And true leadership means agreeing with that.
Ronan Rafferti hopes for housing facilities at the Renessance Club
The former European champion Ronan Rafferti is looking forward to home facilities for the next three days when the Renesans Club in East Latvia will host twenty-fifth open Scottish golf course for older athletes.
The heir of Northern Ireland, who led the meeting at the Archerfield Links Club, moved to the final round last year before Paul Ills was released, joined to a new location and served as the representative of the tournament on behalf of the founder and director of the Jerry Sarvadi Club.
"I saw how the Renessance Club was built, and we see how it was successful with this event," Ruffetti said.
“The players will see this field at his best moment, it is in great shape.
Jerry did a great job putting this place down.
He's a hot-tempered player of this game and proud of his achievements here.
This is a great demonstration for this field."
England Ills is eagerly awaiting the first stop of the champion title, despite the fact that he won his 32-year-old career in the European Tour, and in the European Challenge Tour.
"It's really a special feeling," said a game from Southport.
“I failed to try to win “Extremadura Open” again because it was removed from the schedule over the year after I won it.
Returning to this corner of the world is foolish.
It's a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year are coming back, and my wife and I have been especially impressed by the success of the past year.
It was a really special time, and we will always remember it.”
He returned to the war on his homeland, Gerry Orr, who joined the European tournament for older athletes after he had completed 50 this year.
This event will be his first public appearance in Scotland during the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament in 2013.
"When you play home, it's always very important," said Helensboro Orr.
"You want to say well, but you feel that extra burden."
I played with great pleasure again, and I showed a terrible golf course.
I'm satisfied with everything until it's done."
The three will join the former master tournament winner Yen Vousnem and the champion champions for the older athletes Paul Brodherst, Roger Chepman, Mark James and Mark McNalty.
Orr and former Captain Ryder Cup, Sam Torrens, are two of the six Scottish in the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Steven McCalister, Bill Longmeyer and Ross Drummond.
The tour is free, and the parking is 5 pounds per hour, if one person is in the car, and 10 pounds, if the person is two and more.
All income will come to the British Foundation for Simple Hand.
Britain’s Roads Learn to Grieve Affliction
Their own tunnels over the grids, capable of filling out carbon dioxide-depleting cars, have already been tested on the streets of Great Britain.
The country's transportation agency, as reported by Autocar, reported the positive results of a 100-metre-tonnes test set at one of the corners of the country's north.
The tunnel is 6 metres high, built from some new polymer materials capable of absorbing the harmful substances contained in car exhausts.
However, the establishment of a whole network of such tunnels is only part of the vast measures that the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, English is about to expand the network of power stations for electric cars, undertake a number of road-reducing activities, increase the use of commercial transport in electrical pressure and modernise the heavy cargo park.
According to official statistics, the fourth of all pollutions is due to transport, and the adverse air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgorsud changed the punishment of the disabled Mamaev on the strike
Mosgorsud changed the punishment of the disabled Anton Mamayev, who had been sentenced to four and a half years in the colony, to a fine of 200 thousand rubs.
The TASS reports on this.
Previously, the prosecutor had asked the court to replace the term as conditional, explaining its request that the Mamayev disease “stops him from being in prison”.
28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years ' imprisonment in a general regime for the defeat of which he was a victim of the former Specialist War.
On 19 July, the court released a man from custody at an exit meeting in SIZO.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian golden earth
Ready dinner, Bardina Degei doesn't use the plate.
It's not even bad.
In his wooden house in Enaratoli, the capital of Panya district in the central Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potatoes called “note” right in the eye.
In the long run, they will be able to reach and eat the unpatched, unsatisfied hands.
Degei is sitting on the ground with no furniture, and here she is doing her job on the house, like a drop of soft water from a nearby well.
He's in a safe room without a cross.
She was younger than her husband’s four wives, so she was not assigned to work in the field.
The crowd is scattered here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many are drinking, and still there are soldiers.
"No one decides to go to the forest after five evenings," she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at daily life in the High Pope, the former Dutch colony, which was joined to Indonesia in 1969 after a questionable referendum, when only 1026 elders were able to vote, with a view to the occupying forces.
The existing independent movement of the Netherlands quickly provoked its anger against the Government of Jakarta, which maintained strict control over the region without allowing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua and the independent State of Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Ennalotali is a city as far away as it is concerned; the road here includes a semi-trailer flight from Jaapura, the administrative center of the province, Nabir, and then a five-hour drive from the nearest car.
There's no public transport here.
The city, with about 19,000 inhabitants, is made up of wooden houses covered with bomb shelters.
There was a little welcome here from the Indonesians, no longer talking about journalists, and almost none of the foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the popes worshiped God in the name of Uga Tame.
There were other changes.
“It was unusual for us to wear this dress,” says Degei, pointing to his bright, handcuffed, dark coat and a bright coat.
“We used to wear only paper on the body.”
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, 28 per cent of its population live in poverty, and children's mortality and literacy levels among the deaf in Asia.
But it's still an Indonesian gold earth.
The world's largest and most profitable gold miner, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran in Phoenix, is located in the highest province of Panya, about 153,000 people living in New Jersey.
In 2015 alone, Freeport received about $3.1 billion in gold and silver.
The addendum of Papua can be appreciated by forest stocks estimated at $78 billion.
These wealth, however, will lead to one misfortune for the populace, ensuring that the powerful armed forces of Indonesia remain here with their comforting presence.
According to the New York Times survey in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid to local military personnel and units nearly $20 million, including up to $150,000, a single officer.
The demand for greater autonomy on the part of popes threatens the existence of this golden abode and is heartbreaking.
According to human rights defenders, Indonesia ' s military forces have been killed by more than 500,000 popes since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured, and deprived of liberty.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass killings in the indigenous peoples of the heights of Papua have been considered genocide in the 1970s.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3300 peaceful protestors in the region.
“We are losing everything,” a report published in 2016 by the Brisbian Eparchy contains evidence of acts committed in the past year, such as impunity, torture, particularly as confirmed in another report, rape and eviction, and the cruel persecution of peaceful demonstrations.
“It is difficult to calculate the number of victims, as events take place every week,” says Andreas Harrison, a researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The Hague has been delayed, as the resources of Papua have attracted the flow of displaced persons from other areas of Indonesia.
The population of the province is 83 per cent Christian, but demographic indicators are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the Indonesian island of Java, Sumatra and Slovakia.
Javan lavender, varungi, sells a hot chicken and mixes the gudo-gado egged with an acais sauce.
Locals are trying to maintain competition.
“Migrants started selling chicken and fruit in traditional markets than the people of Papua,” explains Abbet Yoo, a 20-year-old priest of Panya, who moved to Jaapura, the administrative center of the province, because of his work.
“Because of this, Papua’s indigenous people – Mama’s (women’s) Papua – lost their income market.”
Indonesia's President, Joko Vidodo, known as Jokovi, has been subjected to inequality and violations of rights in Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the Presidential Court in Jakarta, the former fleet was supported by 27 of the 29 areas of Papua, including Panya.
In Papua, however, there was little change, and the local people felt betrayed.
“Our heart is broken, because in 2014 we voted for Jokovi, hoping that he will fulfill our hope of restoring justice,” says Yo.
In fact, almost two months after the October inaugural accident, Joe Panya survived the tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street and had their birth-fashioned gymnasiums in Enaratoli, when two Indonesian soldiers fell out of the darkness on the motorcycle.
The frightened children told them that they should include pharaohs.
As reported by local pastor Jjavet Tebay, one of the soldiers tried to attack them and, in time, returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, the soldiers who were drunk were followed by children and were examples of wines.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One boy, sixteen-year-old Julianus Emma, was so badly shot that he fell into someone.
A few hours later, a sudden government building of the electoral commission was lifted, and the next day the situation became tense.
About a thousand populace men, women and children were gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual baths of milk and filled the air, a dance of the populace’s flocks with bread: they ran around and made birds drink.
Some protestors began throwing stones at the police and military base.
When the situation got worse, soldiers on the inside radio were ordered: “If the crowd is fighting more than three times, shoot them,” he said, as confirmed in the official document, which saw the corresponding Times magazine, but which was not published in local media.
Fifteen-year-old Jeremias Kayame, head of the Kegou region of Enaratoli, felt threatened and called for peace when he approached the crowd and asked to leave.
No one wants to hear him.
"When I got back, I was suddenly in the left-hand corner of the pool," he told the magazine "TIME", standing on the wing of his beautiful wooden house.
Some people still don't know who shot them, but they say that the bullet flew from the Shereng gathered soldiers.
"There were a lot of shootings," he adds.
In the local town of Alfiza, Jouva was burned three times, as reported by his twin brother, who became a Witness of the shooting.
“I ran to him and looked at his body to make sure it was him,” said the magazine TIME, Johannes, which, like many Indonesians, is only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I buried him."
General Yotge Mende, the chief police inspector of Papua, told the reporters that his officers were merely "protecting" their base because it had been attacked.
"We must protect when people threaten to kill us," said the representative of the police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistio, in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and much more injured.
The news of the murders reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jack's cousins in Jaapura were moved to express solidarity with the families of the victims and to ask about the historical abuses of authority in Papua.
"I want this situation to be settled immediately so that it will never repeat again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister for Security, Viranto, said that he would establish an impartial organization to put an end to the historic violations of human rights.
But I'm almost there for answers.
“Most of the violations have occurred in the past.
Some of them had a place in the ninth or beginnings of zeros.
The fact is that we certainly want to commit these violations, but there are procedures that must be taken.”
Viranto then turned down his words by talking to the Times magazine on 5 June in Jakarta, and said he was not planning to establish an organization to review the complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "All will be judged by the law."
Viranto, who was charged with “crime against humanity” with killing more than 1,000 people during a blood vote in East Timor in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been committed, including the incident in Spain.
The families of the victims from Spain met with such statements with dark disbelief.
“For the past three years, I have been asked four times, but no changes have been made,” says Johannes.
"I'm up."
He says years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I fear the soldiers will arrest me, I fear they will shoot me."
His brother James also expressed the view that the Lord’s people were afraid of discussing the event.
He said he was killed after he helped to bury four victims.
“After we have buried our bodies, the soldiers have come to me.”
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police fired at the wooden residents near Panya District of Deia.
During the interview between the dereven residents and the manager of the construction company, who refused to help take a man who was unconscious, in the hospital, one person and 17 others were injured, including children.
A man, 20-year-old Ravianus Douv, who died while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The disintegrated village residents protested at the construction site, owned by the company.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at the officers who responded to the warning shots.
However, local residents claim that the mobile Brigades (Indonesia Specials) became a bomb and killed one person.
“We were in this panic, we were afraid of revenge,” reported the TIME magazine, twenty-nine-year-old Doming Badia, who lives on the hospital floor and saw how the wounded were brought back quickly.
"I've been at home for two days."
Parliament of Deiai required that the officers be called to respond and the mobile police Brigade be removed from the region.
Panya has always been a painful place for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of significant development is the lack of ethnic boundaries, coins, data and ladies scattered throughout the territory of the central high-level areas of Papua New Guinea.
Many have joined the “Fourth Movement for the Freedom of the Pope” (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of the popes because of the terrorist attacks and raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the senior OPM leaders are from Spain, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Cgoya.
As a response in the past few years, thousands of people in Spain have been arrested and otherwise detained by the military under the proposal “protection of national independence”.
Some didn't come back.
Among the populace, Panya is considered to be “a lonely, forgotten place”.
Poverty is a source of frustration.
The small proportion of rice sold in Enaratoli is too expensive for local residents.
The bread is not available at exactly the same level.
People here develop everything they need: mainly notes, as well as some fruits and leaves.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of which can be cut by four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the produce for the family, while the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten club notes totaling 10,000 Indonesian rubies (75 cents).
In time, the economic inequalities between indigenous peoples and new migrants increased, which had reached large numbers after the introduction of new air carriers to Nabire airport.
A number of existing vacancies are usually available to more educated and complex migrants.
Pappas often acquire money or skills to carry out their own competitive business.
"Young people don't want to stay in the woods... because there's no work or money here," says John Gobay, president of the Panya National Council.
The isolation holds Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on the work of international SMEs remain severe.
Earlier this year French journalists Frank Escudy and Basil London were deported from Papua to “insufficient agreement with the relevant organizations” despite the fact that they were granted a rare video license.
According to Felima China, Deputy Director of the Human Rights Watch of Asia, promises made during the Jokovi pre-election campaign to remove restrictions on the work of the media in order to promote transparency and development were not implemented.
“For now, foreign journalists trying to report from the Middle East Indonesian provinces, Papua and Western Papua are faced with new dangers: visa refusal and blacklisting,” he said.
The lack of attention by the press means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is, in particular, limited to direct neighbours of Papua.
In March six Pacific States — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands — requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “various and widespread violations” in Papua, including the invasion of Spain.
The same countries in the past supported OPM.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Armanta Nasir, withdrew from the group ' s statement to journalists in Jakarta that “in Indonesia the democratic system is still functioning and there is a free press, so it would be difficult to conceal testimony of human rights violations”.
Local residents want more foreign Governments to pay attention to the situation.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Dutch human rights ambassador, Kissam Van Barar, visited Jajapur on 4 May, the local people violated the silence, petitioning: “We want freedom”, as the source who also attended the meeting wished to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, new presidential elections were held in 2019, but the popes said that they would hardly vote for Jack again.
“Jocky is a man whose intentions are good, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in shooting in Panya,” says Gobay, president of the tribal council.
He wants Jokov to know that the people of Panya, except that they live in the dark, threatened by the alpine army, are in poverty, and education and health are in a state of misery.
Gobay says that the people of Panya, like other popes, consider their vote to be paid for Jack, the debt it has to pay.
They do not need any money, they just want justice.
Despite threats and threats, the families of the victims of the shooting in Spain have carried out the last symbol of non-conformity: they have buried the body of one of the victims on the ground directly against the police and the military.
Knowing that justice never fails, they will at least not allow the innocent to forget their crimes.
"The murder of a member of our family," says Jacobus, a non-representative head.
"What else have we done?"
The second time fire covers the Dubian skyrocket, Fakel.
Fire covered one of the world's highest skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, urging hundreds of people to leave the seven- and-a-half-year-old construction at 337 feet high.
It's already the second fire on a high building, called Fakel, after a fall, for two years.
The building had been evacuated, human victims had not been reported, and there were no operational reports of fire.
“We burned and burned out of the fire and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs, and we needed about ten minutes to get down from the fifteenth floor,” reported a weather agency named George.
According to the civil defence management of Dubai, fire forces set fire at 4:00 p.m. on local time (00:00 p.m.) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working on the granting of asylum to victims.
The event could bring back to the agenda the security issues of materials used in the extraterrestrials of buildings around the world.
In the post-fire investigation of the Faquela administration, it was found that, in 2015, most of the complaints were made — external panels used for training and isolation.
In the United Kingdom, the police said that it was believed that the insulation system and the parking panels of Grenfell-Tauir buildings in London could speed up the spread of what occurred there in June, resulting in the death of about 80 people.
The growth of the tourist stream in Ida-Viruma in June was minimal
According to data received by the Russian.err.ee port correspondent in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017 the services of hotel companies in the North-East were used in a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists, with 125 persons or 0.6 per cent more than in the same period of the same year.
The number of local tourists has decreased, while foreigners have grown.
Yes, in June the foreign tour increased by 7.3% (554 people) to 7994 tourists.
The number of local tourists decreased by 3.2 per cent from 12,944 to 12,525.
The number of Russian tourists in the region increased significantly by 8.9 per cent or 318 compared to June 2016.
In June 2017, guests of Ida-Viruma stayed at 3885 guests from the RF.
And Andrey Mahalov gave understanding to the worshippers who were in his care.
Andrey Malahov found his worshippers in Instagram who were guilty of the "First" channel.
So far he has never commented on the audience, but today he has posted a fragment of the newspaper Knowledge for 1 August.
Photo by Malakov signed the "boss molocosos" tag.
The article on how to prevent a worker from getting up and focusing on his situation.
If you remember the numerous reports that the leader was unable to find a common language with the newly arrived publisher who was about to translate "Pusta to speak", it becomes clear that he was so explicit that he wrote "KP".
It has been reported that the television broadcaster Andrey Malakov is currently on leave and has not signed a declaration of release from the First Channel.
The situation can be explained in the next few days.
Five soldiers were killed in Afghanistan when the car was bombed
At least five military personnel were killed in an explosion in the province of Gilmond, transmitting RIA News.
According to the police, an abandoned car was attacked by a number of military blocks in the Irish road at night.
It's about 20 people who died.
A new CP took place on Friday morning in Girishka.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
The shooting between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Daver took a video from his camera of the shark.
Daver and researcher Greg Scomal (Gree Skomal) wrote on a video about his ex-Camera GoPro.
Rolik was posted on Facebook by the U.S. Maritime Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, a staff member from Somalia.
The incident took place on 2 August at the border of Cape Verde-Cod in the North-East United States, explains Portal Necn.
A man was trying to take off a needle on a camera that was holding on a special deck.
The man noticed that the animal was over 30 feet [3 m] tall.
Acula agreed to cut the camera and did not try to attack a scientist.
Jamal explained that he did so in order to determine whether he was gay.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the crop.
He also noted that such behavior of the marine animal had been practiced by scientists in the news.
The cause of mass trauma in the Ural War Centre
At the training centre in Poland, where there was a mass tragedy, a working group of senior military officers arrived to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this scourge have already been known.
According to the map of Mash, the VContakte, the U.S. military contractors, number 31612, were badly injured because of the infamous blood.
It all began with the fact that, on behalf of Sayan, a series of demonstrably ignored an officer's order to make it more simple.
The officer's side was made up of six soldiers.
Sayana's holding her first leg.
In time, 140 young men were thrown into a cage of blood and cancer, and they were shot by a stick.
More than ten people were injured in the mass drama.
Information on taxation was examined in the CWO.
The study showed that at least one fifth of U.S. passengers were carrying prohibited aircraft items.
The study showed that more than 20 per cent of passengers carried on board the aircraft knowingly or accidentally through items prohibited by the U.S. Transport Safety Administration, including at least 6 per cent of those seated on the aircraft, without having any prohibited shoes or other sharp items.
Nearly 1 per cent reported that they later discovered that they had accidentally had firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study conducted by Stratos Jet Charterers, Inc. and more than 1,000 people showed that young passengers were more inclined to violate the rules.
Of the respondents who recognized that they had deliberately tried to escape from the prohibition of ABB, 19.7 per cent were million compared to less than 15 per cent of X-generation members.
In spite of the knowledge of the ABB staff, food and water are usually available.
More than 3 per cent recognized that they had been subjected to a severe examination, while 2.2 per cent of women respondents and 3.7 per cent of men recognized that they had deliberately carried prohibited drugs on the aircraft.
The company stated that it had studied passengers across the country to find out how many of them had been vaccinated by air inspection and how well they had done so.
We expect that most often - knowingly or unconsciously - to challenge the counter-trafficking by examining those who fly the most.
As the company points out, the ABB rules are quite complex and complicated.
People often don’t know exactly what liquids they can carry and how much they can carry.
It is no wonder, therefore, that most of the ABB's choices are prohibited fluids.
Some time ago, people thought that ABB could be considered prohibited from carrying the book.
Juveniles are allowed on internal routes, but not on international routes.
Chapter EPA Priyt refuses to postpone the implementation of both emission reduction rules
The next day, following the request of 15 States of the Environment Agency, the Chief of Environment Agency withdrew its decision to postpone the implementation of the regulations adopted by Obama to reduce the emissions of pollutants from air and lead to capacity education.
The Preuit explained its decision that its agency is now more than in previous administrations than in the need for environmental regulators of individual states.
He did not mention an appeal against his previous position in the Federal Court of Appeal.
The barrier was extended around 1 October, for which States should ensure compliance with the 2015 Earth-level ozone standards.
In June, the Priytt announced that it would postpone their compliance for one year to give her Government more time to study the plan and avoid "inconsistencies in local decisions or barriers to economic growth".
The Preuit, which before being appointed by the President-in-Office of the Treaty, was the Attorney-General of Oklahoma, was long known as a consistent violation of environmental standards.
After moving to Washington, Priyt had repeatedly blocked or revoked the introduction of rules that opposed the chemical or gas-depleting industry.
The unexpected change in the course in the middle is the regular legal expression of the Pietto course taken to return to the previous rules.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the head of EPA had exceeded its mandate by attempting to postpone the implementation of the regulations adopted by Obama by oil and gas companies to track and reduce the flow of metals.
In a statement made in the middle of the evening, Priuit suggested that, in the course of changing the course on ozone standards, he simply fulfilled the obligation of EPA to cooperate with the States in the integrated process of timely implementation of new standards.
“In previous EPA administrations, it was often not possible to apply for a specified period, after which a group of activists and other persons were held and discussed the deadlines during the settlement of the case,” said Priyt, who made more investigations against EPA at his previous post.
"We do not believe in the regulation through judicial processes, and we are seriously concerned about the deadlines set.
We too are concerned about our position and the authority it gives us."
However, the EPA statement states that the Prijutt may at some point again use its "repetition authority and other data by law" to ensure that the rules "jcyjdfys on a clear course and on all available information".
The Republicans of the Congress are focusing on a broader revision of the ozone-related rules.
The draft Act, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to postpone the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of States that filed this week's complaint against EPA, said that the group intended to continue the legal pressure.
"The change in the EPA course - following our demands - is an important victory in the fight against health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the power of their city," Schneiderman said.
New York joined in the search for California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the Colombia area.
Earth-level ozone is present when conventional pollutants from machinery, electricity, oil processing plants and chemicals and other sources enter the atmosphere in response to sunlight.
The resulting power can cause serious breathing problems to those who are sensitive to it, leading to thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health defenders and environmental defenders welcomed the unexpected change in the Priuit course.
"It's hard to think about how much pressure it takes to get this perfectly logical step from the human being who has been ordered to protect the air we're learning," said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to oppose the ideological campaign of the administration of the trampa and the protection of those who pollute the air and their particular interests.”
The IAAF Congress extended the removal of the Russian Federation by a light athletic
The Congress of the International Association of LEGs (IAAF) voted in favour of the extension of the Universal Federation of Light Athletics (WFLA).
The Congress thus supported the IAAF Board on the restoration of VFLA, which issued a report on Monday, in which it recommended that the removal be left in force.
For the extension, 166 people voted against - 21 were transferred to the TASS.
The report of the Board of IAAF stated that FFA has made significant progress in meeting the conditions set by the Board of Rehabilitation, but these conditions have not yet been fully met.
As a result of the disqualification of VFLA at the World Championships in London, Russian helicopters were forced to speak under the neutral flag.
There were 19 people on board who were admitted to the IAAF.
VFLA has been receiving permanent disqualification from IAAF in 2015.
The report was then published by the independent expert of the World Anti-Dumping Agency (WADA) Dica Panda, which dealt with numerous violations of the WADA regulation by Russian officials and athletes.
For more details of the latest report of the IAAF Board, read in "E" "IAAF extended sanctions on VFLA".
Contradiction
In the 3rd round of Russia's PFL's New Moscow's "Himik" team, the FC Caluga was engaged in a march against FC Caluga.
More than 10 days ago, opponents were playing each other in the pocket of Russia, but this time the picture of the game was perfect.
Mike didn't give up on anything, but a second weakness in the background of the match led to a test of neck and face.
After a recent blast from the carbon count 0:3 many earlier prophesied the easy victory of farmers.
However, from the start of the meeting, the newcomer had to be considered and acted on the defence but on the position of force.
In the 1st team, there was a lot of confusion, and there was a profit in the control of the sword.
Alexei Sirotin, who several times experienced serious injuries and his actions, gave assurance to his partners.
Unfortunately, Hhimiko's attack did not take any effort and effort to put Kalugi in a trap and kill the first hole on the way out.
After the game was over, we started playing on the meetings.
The New Yorkers were more active in the attack.
The alarm bells for our team have been a mistake in the defense, which has allowed the cholera to create a number of sharp moments.
At the end of the 10-minute meeting, Mike took over the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the cholera’s experience played a role — they were more grammatical and cold - blooded at the end, and they had their own time to take the lead.
After the dangerous attack, Mike moved his sword to a coal mine, which was given by the farmer without opposition to the door.
The author became Yuri Dubrovin.
At the reporting meeting, Mike demonstrated a bad game, but he suffered a series of injuries.
Our team is waiting for another departure from Moscow on 11 August at 19 hours on the "Torpedo" season, named Eduardo Strelzkova, to meet with the favorite FC centre "Araat", composed of Roman Pavlučenko, Marat Izmalilov, Igorj Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come and support Mike.
The location and time of the meeting of the New Yorkers is 18.30 p.m. at the corner of Magnolia (East, D.2, Corp.
The composition of "Himika": Sirotin, Manakhin (k), Romašenko, Shaunov, Homotto, Goghya (Oreshkin), Doudati, Rizov, Saints, Belan (Adoeves), Andreychenko (Ligin)

According to the publicized telephone talks, the tramp had moved to Mexico on the payment of the wall at the border
The Washington Post newspaper published the diffusion of telephone talks between US President Donald Tramp and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, during a telephone conversation with Mexico President Enrique Pjej Néto Tramp, he urged it to stop publicly stating that he would not be paying for the planned wall at the border.
The President of the United States called on him because he was publicly speaking against the wall and, according to the information, said to him: “You cannot say this press.”
The tramp launched its pre-election campaign, promising to build a wall near the southern border of the United States, and asked Mexico to pay for the project.
His first telephone interview with the Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Ternbull, also revealed a warm atmosphere.
Tramp told Ternbull that the agreement that the United States had to accept refugees sent to Australia was “a joke”, “a joke” and “tupoo” and insisted that because of the agreement concluded by Obama, he would look like an idiot, as he intended to stop the moving of refugees to the United States.
The tramp ended the conversation, said Ternbull that “it was the most unpleasant conversation all day”.
The dead bodies in Abkhazia sent a plane from Soci to Peterburg
Aeroplane, owned by the Russian Air Company, on which the bodies of the Russians were killed in Abkhazia, was transferred to the TASS at 20:15 in the Moscow time from Soci to St. Petersburg.
At the end of the investigation, the officers of the ritual agency, as well as the representatives of the city Mary, told the journalists of the Deputy Minister for Kurts and Tourism of Abkhazia Astamir Ahba.
The former representatives of the IMIS stated that all the costs associated with the delivery of the body back to Russia had been borne by the Government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Suhum intends to pay the families who have lost compensation in the amount of 500 thousand rubles.
According to Abkhazia, Abkhazia's leadership was willing to pay to relatives who had died as a result of the explosions of tourists and living in the Republic, but relatives had only expressed their trust in the Republic to the right of local authorities to act in accordance with the established order.
On 2 August, about 16:20 at the time of Moscow, two explosions occurred in the village of Primor Guutat, on the basis of the Ministry of Defence's missile-artillery weapons, following the detonation of large-calibre tanks and other ammunition.
As a result, the replacement of the storage facility caused uncontrolled explosions of various equipment.
As a result, two citizens of Russia, Elena Polakov, were killed in 1970 and Elena Timofe, born in 1962, who were at rest near the source of the seabed.
64 persons, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, were brought to the medical institutions of the Republic with varying severity.
At present, there are seven people in the station, the rest being written.
A study of the Russian influence on the American elections has taken a great turn
The Russian prosecutor, Robert Muller, made a major jury in Washington, Russia's presidential election in 2016, reports The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
The major jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to ask witnesses under oath.
The collected material will be examined by the Prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient to make charges.
The call of a great jury gives Muller additional authority to collect evidence.
One of the investigations of the jury's colleagues, which began work a few weeks ago, will be the details of the Son's meeting, then the president of Donald Trampa, with Russian lawyer Natalie Veselnik.
To check the details of this meeting, held in June 2016, Mueller promised himself.
They're already researched by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Tramp-young had expanded the status of his lawyers.
The young tramp told me earlier that since his meeting with Wesselnicka, he had kept a compromise at the candidate's headquarters at the Hillary Clinton Deputies, but no dissuasive documents had been presented, and the result was the adoption.
At the beginning of August, a number of SMEs were informed that the Trampa Youth Statement on the meeting with Wesselnicka was literally inspired by the Trompom.
In the White House, it was explained that the president did not dictate anything but simply used his authority to do what any father would do.
Vice-Mercy Pens were kept at work
The Deputy Chief of the Administration of Pennsylvania, Irina Shirchin, has been detained for 48 hours by the Follow-up Committee at its place of work, reports RIA News.
Official communications from the law enforcement authorities in this regard have not yet been made, but the CSC Press Service has assured them that they will soon follow.
There's no comment on what's going on in the Pennsylvania Maryland.
Irina Shirsina is one of the five vice presidents of the Board of Directors of the Pensions.
It has been working on urban issues and land relations since April 2015.
She has been working for a long time with the head of the Gosjillströhtechen inspection in the Pennsylvania area.
Irina Sherchina is raising three minor children, and it is noteworthy that she has become a mother a year ago, and she has refused to leave and returned to work.
Of course, there's no space in Mexico, no rocket carriers.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
And the establishment of Yuria Gagarina's bus is the first man to be respected in space.
Unlike memories of the Soviet period, which are held in some countries, the memories of Gagarin, on the other hand, are “floating on the planet”.
In 2012, the monument was established at the former NASA headquarters in Houston, U.S.A.
In London, a monument to the Royal Observatory was established at the time of the 50th anniversary of the first flight to space.
There is a memorial in Gagarin, Germany, in Erfut, where our cosmonaut was born in 1963.
A memorial in the Carlow Wars, Czech Republic, was avoided by public protests in 1992 and was transferred from the city center to the front of the local airport.
In the 1970s, Gagarina appeared in Riga as a memorial of Jurius Gagarins.
That's what the name and name of the first Latvian cosmonaut sounds like, and it looks like it's been done for 70 years.
Killing Mors Ford: Activists lose Lynda's courts on stage to call for justice
Ford Merciuri went to the village of Monroe in 1948, in Georgia, with a smile on his face to the small bridge of Mors Ford.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver went to the bridge, a group of white men with a roses crossed the road.
The middle-aged man in the middle-aged suit in the dark of the forest was hit by a cigarette and looked through the wind glass.
Sitting inside was scared.
"We need this nigga, Roger!" said the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
The prognosis broke the silence when a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, was just a stage.
But when the Rogers were on the show, almost all the viewers and really were breathing.
Since 2005, activists have returned to the Morse Ford Bridge to resurface that night when two black couple, Roger and Dorothy Malko and George and May Murray Dorsey in 1946.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It's clear that no one has been arrested for all these years - although we see them together; although we know who they are," said Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the decision.
"It's five in our history and it's a stone in our souls."
71-year-old Brooks, former member of the Georgia Congress, who has fought for human rights for the rest of his life.
For him, it is a dramatic call for action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice has not been corrected.
"We want investigations, we want completion, we want reconciliation, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he says.
"We can't go back to recovery and reconciliation until we get justice."
The Coroner covers one of the victims of rape at Mors Ford on 27 July 1946.
According to the FBR materials received by En-Bi-Si News, more than 50 people in Monro and neighboring societies were suspected of participating in lynching.
But no one was charged with this.
Although the suspected decades remained free, human rights defenders say that the city has always been well aware of two related motives: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court’s decision first allowed black citizens to vote in a preambular vote that was due this summer.
About the same time, according to the FBI, blacksmith Roger Malcolm hit Barnett Hester, a white landowner, apparently because of women.
Brooks says that, according to the audience in the city, Hester slept with his wife, Malcolm Doroti, and that the child she was supposed to have been born was not of a husband.
According to the FBI, on 25 July 1946, Loi Harrison, a large white owner, paid $600 to release Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins, May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they left the prison and went to the Morse Ford Bridge, a mob surrounded the car.
"It is clear that he organized and ordered Harrison's murder," which is found in one of the FBI reports.
“It is also evident that there was a dialogue between state and city law enforcement authorities who not only participated in the killings but also destroyed the streets and hid the identity of witnesses.”
Brooks calls it a step.
"It was an attempt on electoral rights," he says.
"They have all been killed in order to send a signal to the city. If you register and vote, it will be the same for you."
About ten years ago, Cassandra Green is conducting an annual show that reproducing this painting at the Mors Ford Bridge.
Its mirror is monitored, it captures the viewer and boasts of the deep racism that many would like to see no more in America.
It's hard to see and it's harder to turn back, but Green thinks it's the main one.
"We don't want to talk about Linda's courts because they show us our own kindness," she says.
"But I can't build relationships with you if you don't listen to me or hear what I've been through."
This year's performances began in June, and on the first day of the year, almost 30 players -- white players, the others, gathered in the room and heard an annual song review.
Wade Marbo was a director with Green.
He's been playing the role of the main member of the clan for a few years, but he says it's not that easy.
"I think I've fallen because it's not the man I am," says Marbo.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to go back at that time."
In the room of the actor Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, play their roles.
Spectator starts with Malcolm, explaining that Hester sleeps with his wife Dorota, screams and interprets him.
"I said, now, get out of my house!"
Call Rascona in response.
The blast is broken.
At the same time, all (at least, all black actors) are exposed to chaos.
Green's laughing at everyone.
"What's that?" Ask Ascona.
He's worried and upset.
Am I playing?
"No," says Green with a smile.
"I just don't think the white ones were saying 'no' at the time."
Yeah, we're one of the blackmen.
"You must bear a firm 'r'."
The same is true of the energy in the room: the comfort is changed by the feeling of friendship.
Everything should be done right, not only for the songs, but also for the memory of four people killed.
The scene is starting.
This time, when Rascona says the word "no", it gets clear and sharp.
No one laughs.
The Spectacular is ending very badly and fast.
Crys, shots, and then silence.
A woman in a dark black suit is standing over the bodies of actors and performing a rough song by Billy Hollywood "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by the word.
In the hundreds of gardens of it, hundreds of sights are drawn from the eyes of the lake and the floor.
The audience is almost equal to the number of blacks and whites.
A couple came from Italy, New York, to see the presentation; many live around.
They've been suffering for almost eight hours from George's heavy breath while Brooks took them to the Malcolmov and Dorsey's graveyard.
To this day, killings have remained only history, but now that they stand at the same place where people were kidnapped, their sights seem to be breathing in the air.
When the last note of the song comes to light, Green invites people to come closer and look at the body.
The children are cut to their heads, ordered to be red with blood, and not moving to the body and spit something else.
"They're not dead at the moment," a little boy fighting to remember for himself.
Within a few minutes, Green is grateful to the viewers, and the other thing is over.
The actors are throwing the wires out of the window and pulling the strings out.
Bradshaw's wearing Marbo, a man in his suit who played the main kuklusclan.
Nick Rascona has two other actors and a second, crying, falling in love with them: the emotional burden of the mirror has finally fallen on him.
"All right," one of the women jumps.
"We know that your heart is good.
You have a reason for it."
The viewers will be able to work together with the actors later.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta discussed the spectacle with a black couple they had just met.
Denise Daplinski, working hard, thanks to the word to describe how she feels after the show.
"It's hard to hear these terrible, bitter words and actions... people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think the shootings are going on," she adds, "only now it's called the police shooting."
In the second corner of the room, the rule of Tyron Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender, is a common focus.
He said he had already begun to plan the presentation of the next year.
"Remaining encourages us because it not only describes the fear that we have survived but teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't get out of this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are turned on its repeat."
The Court sentenced Naval to a violation of the "aggressive Saturday"
The Moscow Court of Moscow sentenced Alexei Naval to 300 thousand rubles for violating the organization's order.
The opposition was recognized as guilty of an administrative offence provided for in paragraph 8 of paragraph 20.2 of COP RF “Reconvention of the organization of mining”.
Former judge of the Moscow Court of Justice, Hzir Mussakaev, had concluded an administrative hearing with regard to Leonida Volkova, head of the opposition headquarters of Alexea Naval, who was responsible for the same article as the Naval.
Volkov was recognized as guilty and sentenced to 300 thousand rubles.
In this amount, Judge Mussakaev assessed the distribution of the letter to the "Agitiation Saturday", which was held by the Naval Party in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
Having seen the agit materials followed by the subsidized police thought that the organizers of the event were deliberately hiding its true importance as a public action (which required prior authorization from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zdanov and Alexander Pomazuev sought to stop administrative production because of the lack of criminality and indicated that the police had allowed certain gaps in the drafting of the protocol.
In fact, Volkova was not detained at the “Agitiation Saturday” but received a report that required him to appear in the police office to report on the event carried out during his active participation.
The same information was received by the Nevulla and another opponent, Nikolai Liskin.
Mordonia was arrested by a youngster and three guests of the wedding
The Mordovian court arrested a local resident who was shot at by four men, including a bride.
This was reported to the Department of the Republic of the Follow-up Committee.
The incident occurred on evening 29 July.
During the summer of 42-year-old Saranska, the inhabitants of Saranska fired several times in the rural areas.
As a result of the injuries, three women and one man were injured.
Criminal proceedings have been brought under article 213, paragraph 1 (a), section 3, and article 30 (a), paragraph (e), section 2, paragraph 105 (“Prevention on the murder of two and more persons who have been committed in a general manner from the Huligan incitement”).
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man opened the shed because the guests of the wedding decided to dig through the territory of his place for water.
Mining will meet the requirements of the turbine suppliers for power stations
The Ministry of Energy of the IMF will update the rules for providing information to suppliers critically important equipment, in particular electricity turbines.
At the start of the gas turbines, GES turbines, oil tank facilities and oil supply providers will be required to share data on access to the miner and the Federal Office for Technical and Export Control.
The draft Government resolution is ready for public discussion.

Pierson reduces another 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to return business to life
On Friday, the British Educational Group of Pierson announced that it would reduce the number of additional 3,000 jobs and reduce the number of temporary dividends by 72 per cent due to the start of a regular restructuring programme aimed at combating the problems faced by their businesses.
These cuts, which, according to the head of John Fellon's company, occur mainly at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, are in addition to 4,000 jobs reduced during the previous restructuring.
Pierson announced that it is planned to reduce the cost of another 300 million dollars (394 million United States dollars) in May during the third cost reduction programme in order to try to get back to business, which has affected the rapid transition to digital learning methods.
The company agreed last month to sell its share of the Penguin Random House to its partner, the Bertelsman conference, said that its forecast for the year remained unchanged after it announced an increase of 1 per cent in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Attack of a horse in Kabul: soldier Nato died as a result of a deadly explosion
According to information received from the official sources, a terrorist killed a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killed one NATO soldier and wounded several others.
Five soldiers and interpreters were wounded, as reported in NATO communication.
According to unverified data from local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the events in the village of Karabakh.
This explosion, the last of Afghanistan's casualties this month, killed more than 30 people on Tuesday.
On Monday, a terrorist killer killed two people at the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, an explosion that occurred on Thursday night occurred when a joint combat with the Afghan army was attacked with the help of “a permanent individual of a self-distributive explosive device”.
According to the report, all wounded are in a stable condition and are treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airport.
Correspondents report that the growing power of Taliban and a group known as the Islamic State (IG) in Karabakh is a major source of concerns for NATO forces located near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, in the first half of 2017, Afghanistan had at least 1662 victims among the civilian population and about 20% of them were in the capital.
At the end of July, a deadly terrorist attack on the car killed at least 30 people in the Shia area in Kabul.
Taliban said they had caused the attack.
As a result of a powerful bombing in the city centre on 31 May, more than 150 people were killed — the most serious of the number of human casualties in the country since the U.S. military had removed Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence accentuates the situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Tramp appreciates the need to increase the number of United States military forces providing assistance to the military and police in the country.
According to correspondence, the tactics in Kabul over the past few weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the Government, its line of conduct, and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Gani.
The Environmental Protection Agency, following trials, rejects the decision to postpone the adoption of the Air Pollution Act
The U.S. Environment Agency has declined the decision to postpone the adoption of the Obama era law, whereby States should limit air pollution emissions, a day after 15 States had been brought before the agency for that reason.
In the middle of the evening, the Environment Agency announced its decision to implement what is called the 2015 ozone measurement, stressing that this step reflects the readiness of the Agency to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue with our partners in the states and appeal for them,” said Scott Priyt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
In June, the Priutt announced the intention of the Environment Agency to defer ozone measurements, where existing air pollution is measured in various parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet more strict air standards for one year until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratics, together with the federal area of Colombia, filed a claim that this was illegal.
The Administration of President Donald Trampa is trying to reverse the wide range of environmental regulations introduced by President Barak Obama, in a broader programme aimed at developing economic growth, in the words of the Trampa.
However, action in this regard has led to opposition from democracies and environmental organizations concerned with the potential impact of major emissions on the health of the population.
The Environment Agency website notes that the use of ozone-depleting air "can weaken the function of light and enhance respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
The Association of European Business against New Anti-Russian Sanctions
The European Business Association has expressed disagreement with the US economic sanctions against the IMF.
In the opinion of the EIB, such measures may lead to a significant reduction in production and number of jobs.
The AEB statement states that business is one of the important links between countries and people, so it cannot be limited to the principles of free trade.
The European business unites more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls upon the Heads of State and Government of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would allow business to separate from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and agreement.
Members ask the police to restrict the movement of the police in the Psco area
The pskov national electorate addressed the head of the WMWD on the city of Sergey Surin on the move to the coast of the Great Sea.
Members of the pride of Constantine Bolotin, Gregory of the Parties and Valerie of the Forests believe that car drivers are interfering with people to play and breathe in this place.
In their view, monitoring of drivers would help to make this territory more peaceful and safe.
The problem is that the offenders ignore the signs of "The Road" and are free of charge.
It is found that the capital repairs and repairs have been carried out.
Sports and children's rooms are not comfortable because of the car.
As the Pskov Information Agency notes, the PPS and its partners are patrolled at night by central security personnel.
The number of motorists has been reduced, but the whole movement has not been stopped.
Putin was required by the investigating authorities not to have a hard disk
President Vladimir Putin of Russia proposed that the investigating authorities not remove servers and hard disks from business computers.
The Head of State made a statement at a meeting on investment programmes for the development of the Far East.
According to the President, it is necessary to “remove the use of measures leading to the cessation of business activities, including the removal of hard disks from working computers and servers”.
Putin noted that if the investigators have such a need, “it is sufficient to remove copies, verify them and use them during the investigation”.
The Head of State added that “it is not possible to create conditions that prevent businesses from continuing their activities until it is impossible to pay taxes”.

The death of British actor Robert Hardy
British actor Robert Hardy, who played the Minister of Magic Cornelius Fadja at the scene of a series of novels on Harry Potter, died at the age of 92.
That's what the Independent newspaper reported on Thursday.
The actor's death was told by his relatives.
According to them, he lived “a life of luxury and success in cinema, theatre and television for 70 years. ”
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English city of Cheltnym.
In 1959 he played with Laurence Olive at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in the "Tragedy of Coriolan".
Hardy also recalled the repeated role of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of the exhibitions of Agata Kristi's production on Ms. Marple.
He was awarded the British Academy of Film and Television (BAFTA) prizes for the role of Churchill in the Bi-bi-s teledrama "Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years" (1981).
Robert Hardy also did not have to play the role of President Delano Rusvelt of the United States.
There was something in the Danish State: Prince Henrik, and, in fact, Henry Marie Jean Andre, Count de Laborod, refused to be buried with his veneer husband, King Margaret.
This year, there's a golden wedding, but on the agenda of the couple, it's not about preparing for the competitions, it's a closed debate.
His height declined from the title of the prince-consortion, and he fell to the king's address, and never did he have the title of the King-Consort.
Henrik lives in France, although he is an official queen's husband.
Russia's MID called Washington to stop spying on Moscow
In the Middle East, Russia responded to the statement by Mother Pens, who was accused of Moscow in an attempt to destabilize the Balkans.
The corresponding statement was circulated by the Foreign Office some time ago.
In its comments, MID pointed out that the United States was increasingly using cold war stamps, inadequate modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats have called on the US authorities to stop REF in pursuit.
According to the "Arguments Sunday" of the attack, U.S. Vice-President Mike Pens accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize Western Balkan countries and the organization of the infamous referendum in Montenegro.
The Mothers of Garcia and Vasili Lomachenco meet for the first time, to discuss the possibility of a decisive unit
Vasili Lomačenko and Mike Garcia, who, the judges of the whole, are constantly moving to conduct the most offensive boxing match in the near future, first met on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the official rooms of the ESPN in Los Angeles, while Garcia, an infamous champion in the light of the World Boxer Council, did not pass the corridor to welcome Lomačenko, the World Bokser Organization champion in the second half of the season.
After the unique victory of Garcia over the former World Championship in the four heavyweight categories by Irene Broner on Saturday at the Showtime channel, both boxers belong to the five best boxers outside the weight categories.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Give it to you."
Lomačenko protects his post in a match with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at seven o'clock on the ESPN channel.
When the boxers looked at the photo, manager Lomachenko Egis Climas noted that the potential decisive fight between them would be the first time.
"I used to be in the sixth grade," Garcia recalled.
"I've been in the category of Broner's career [up to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big anymore.
I'm painting for 140.
I want to go down to the semi-trailer.
And he needs to get up to half a mile [up to 135 pounds], and then we're gonna set up a unit.
That's what patients want.
Let's make it happen to them."
Lomachenko agreed.
"The box needs this unit."
Climas asked whether the fight should be transpired through the PPV service as part of the strategy that he maintains for Lomachenko to carry out his debut fight in weight 135 this year, to appoint for the next summer a meeting with Garcia (37-0.30 knots), which was also interested in meeting with the winner of the unity between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their battle for the World Championship on 23 September.
“Boy may be on PPV, because all the patients have asked for it,” said Garcia, expressing his willingness to move on to the channel that offers better financial conditions.
"We are the main names.
No other names will cause such interest.
As soon as they are ready...’
Garcia said that he considered Lomačenko to be a “containing boxer” and may have visited his Saturday unit.
But Lomačenko didn't come to greet Garcia immediately and said that, in his opinion, the champion in the three volumes of Riversaida seems to be "very gentle, sorry, Mikey... you asked for a kiss."
Garcia said he was focusing on showing the power of the hit, and then the box.
They both said that they feel the pressure increases to their own unit.
“This fight must be held.
No other fight is of such interest and conversation.
I'm more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for someone from the shipbox, and here he is, Mikey.
That will be a great fight."

New test results for assessing the age of asylum seekers in Sweden
The latest results of the asylum-seekers tests in Sweden, which have introduced a new health assessment method, show that more than 80 per cent of protestors have been evaluated as persons under the age of 18 but not all of them are convinced of the accuracy of these findings.
The Swedish National Medicines Agency (Rätttsmedicalverket) began testing earlier this year.
They were designed to assess the age of asylum after the Swedish Migrationsverket was critical of the fact that it was unable to determine the age of some refugees who claimed to be underage.
The Migrationsverket was currently conducting 6,880 trial cases, and the judiciary has now published the results of 2,481 tests for the period from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) of tested persons were evaluated as persons aged 18 or older, and in 25 other cases, the judiciary assessed that “probably 18 or older persons”.
In the case of 432 cases, the finding stated that the person was “probably less than 18”.
Tests are carried out only when the age of man raises doubts.
According to John Gioarson of the Judicial Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with the results in the past month.
"We don't see a big difference with statistics in the past month, the number is full," he said to the portal The Local.
The high proportion of cases where people were assessed as 18 years of age does not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers were lying about their age.
In May, the agency published 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases “at least 18 years or more of age tested”.
However, considering 581 published results, Svenska Dagbladet found that, in 243 cases, it was publicly stated that 18 were to be fulfilled this year.
The method of medical evaluation of the age to make the ring of the teeth of the teeth of wisdom and tomography and tomography of the knee organs and to analyse them to dentists and X-rays has also been critical in some institutions.
One of the sceptics is an endocrinologist from the Charolin Institute of Claude Marcus, part of whose work is to assess people's biological maturity in order to determine whether they have gone through sex before or after normal.
“I have reason to think about it, and I do not think that it is necessary to use the methods of measurement that are now being used.
This is how biological age is defined very wrong.
If we can't define it with confidence, we don't have to do what we can," said the Metro newspaper.
However, Goranssen, from the judiciary, said in terms of accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk of adopting a child as an adult is misbehavior.
We face the greatest risk when a person is about 18 per cent".
I wonder if you're going to vote in president's position.
During his working trip to Burundi, Vladimir Putin said he was prepared to consider whether he was being voted for by Russia's president at the 2018 election, he was transferred to Interfax.
This statement was a response to the request of the inhabitants of the village of Chemushka Buritt.
During the video conference on the elimination of fire in Burundi and the Irkutsk area, the meeting turned to Putin with the words: "Vladimir Vladimmirovic, we ask you, when the next presidential elections are to be held, we all ask you to re-ballow on this post."
"Horosh, I think, thank you," said the president in reply.
On 28 July, the President of Russia, President Dmitry Peskov, commented on a number of media statements that the head office of Vladimira Putin was headed by President Anton Vain.
Peskov called these assumptions “no based, hypothetical reasoning”.
"There's no chairs, no chairs, no chairs away, no election campaign away," Peskov said.
"It's not on the agenda until it's on the agenda," Peskov said.
The Governor of West Virginia said he was moving into another party
The Governor of West Virginia, the representative of the Democratic Party, Jim Jastys, announced on Thursday during the morning with the participation of President Trampa, who is moving into another party.
"You like it or not, but the democracies have left me," said Governor Justin.
“Today I speak to you with many prayers and many thoughts... today I speak to you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be useful to you, remaining a democratic Governor.”
Mitting's been attacked by affluence.
"That is why I will change my registration to the Republican tomorrow," Jastis added.
"As a coach, I would tell you that time to play the other one."
Previously, Tramp had promised that an important statement would be made at a rally in West Virginia.
The tramp won in West Virginia by 42 per cent, and Justin did not support the candidate from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton.
Justin, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he belongs to coal mines in five states, as he inherited the coal business from his father.
It is estimated at $1.59 billion.
At that time, the National Committee of the Republican Party issued a statement on Thursday evening that “the transition of Governor Jashis to another party is another attack on the Democratic Party, which is more likely to interfere than it is to make our country big again”.
“In view of the total of 15 governors and control over the minimum number of state legislative bodies in history, the statement of Governor Jashis is just another refusal from the party that has no leadership over the bottom and is unable to find a positive, unified message,” said CBS News, representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Ronna McDeniel.

Who commended Russia for its “extraordinary” apology for the doping scandal
The international expert on easy-to-flyer Sebastian Cou praised on Thursday for his sincere apology from Russia for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it was now an inappropriate time to allow the country to participate again in sports events.
The Russian Federation's representative, Dmitry Slakhtin, reported at the International Association of Light-Athletic Federations Congress, which had been threatened by the World Championship on Light-Athletics, that his country's removal from athletic competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all sportsmen who had been stolen from gold and silver medals at the fairs”.
Despite its comments, the Congress of the International Association of LEGs voted to maintain the removal imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Dumping Agency (WADA) published a report on the evidence of the State-funded use of doping.
“I have found that today’s response, today’s report has been very honest,” said the rapporteurs, the President of the International Association of Light-Athletic Federations Cou.
“The whole Council and the Congress were pleased... that the Russian Federation itself would admit that it had been a very good time and is now doing everything possible to worry about the re-establishment of the Federation.”
He said that he was also “stumbled”, that Russia agreed with the criteria for his restoration.
“I think it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Special Commission, which now does not allow Russia to regain its rights,” Kou said.
“For the next few months, we must do everything we can to cope with this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean sportsmen from the affected system.”
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Light-Athletic Federations will participate in a neutral campaign for the world of light athletics, which will begin on Friday in London.
The Head of the Special Commission of the International Association of LEGs, Rune Andersen, stated on Monday that a number of requirements must still be met for the restoration of Russia.
As he reported to reporters in London after a report made to the International Association of LEGs, drug testing is not yet carried out sufficiently, and foreign trainers are still doing their work in a calm manner.
The Court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of committing aggression
The detained Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) transmits to the SBI a two-month arrest by journalist Vasili Muraviski.
The Internet-based Journal of Zitamora is suspected of a change in government by placing its publications on Russian websites and in violation of Ukraine ' s territorial integrity.
At the same time, Russia does not support the action of the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, as it is “warwar policy” against the media.
Two years after the outbreak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The Corporal Commandant Borsin entered the territorial waters of Libya to stop the flow of illegal migrants along with the WMS of the country.
The decision to initiate the operation was taken by the Italian Parliament in the middle.
Rome agreed with the internationally recognized Government of Libya, which in turn does not control most of the territory of the country.
The opposition cabinet and the Libyan parliament based in Tobruk accused Italy of violating the sovereignty of Libya.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Feldmarshal Haftar, gave his orders against Italian ships.
In Rome, they have also stated that they do not believe these threats and are intended to send another military vessel into the Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week in the negotiations of Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the recognized European office of Faiza Saraj.
The Italian authorities went to set up an illegal migration maritime mission after a statistics were published in July on the number of illegal immigrants arriving in Libya: 95 thousand people from the beginning of the year.
The Government stated that the resources for the reception of migrants had been exhausted.
A massive crash occurred in Skype.
The global problem of Skype's service has now been established in several countries of the world.
On Thursday, 3 August, users began to file complaints to programme developers.
Microsoft stressed that experts are already working actively to address the problems faced by Europeans and North America, clarifying the RIA "News".
We remember that in June of this year, Skype was also affected.
Users could not receive and send messages for a while.
Two leaders from Ukraine's collective athletic community have been removed from participation in the MM
Olga Landlac and Olles Povh, who specialize in escape on short distances, are excluded from Ukraine's collection at the 2017 World Championship in London.
This is reported on the Federation's website with the country's easy-to-fly (FLAU).
Such a decision was taken by the United Nations in connection with the promotion of the International Association of LEGs (IAAF) disciplines for LAGs.
As part of the Ukrainian delegation, a trainer from the Land of Sergey Basenko was also excluded.
According to Sportarena, the IAAF suspects athletes using doping.
Povh - the Olympic 2012 bronze prize and the 2011 World Championship, the 2010 European Championship at 4 to 100 metres estaphet, the Earth - the 2012 European Spring winner at 4 to 400 metres.
The World Championship for Light Attraction in London will be held from 4 to 13 August.
How the financial rules of football affect the passage of Nemira to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited trats by European football clubs do not interfere with the world record of the transfer of Niemara from Spain to Paris-Germany in France.
Whatever the consequences may be, the Paris St. Germany, the lead body of the European Football Control Board, which has the authority to ban the participation of the troops in the prestigious League of Champions tournament, may be further affected.
In the 2011 UEFA Financial Fair Regulations, the IPG should finally show that the Nemera transfer has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) only to free a Brazilian from the contract, and Nemir will be charged with ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Nemara's move to France.
The PSPs can be decoyed to hire Nemara and add it to the galaxies of other stars if they take into account the funding of the team by the wealthy Katar's family's energy.
Clubs have the right to spend large amounts on the acquisition of toys, but they have to balance them with the legitimate sources of income in order to achieve the cost of profitability in their football business.
FFP introduced Michel Platinie after his election to the President of the UEFA in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs that were in great debt in their quest for success would actually have been robbed and threatened with failure if banks or owners had stopped financing.
In 2011, FFP stopped focusing on debt clubs and turned to track their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model, which Roman Abramovic used in Chelsea in 2003, was to buy clubs with good potential and then make a serious effort to improve the team and create a world brand, became a difficult plan.
During the current three-year period of assessment covering 2018, clubs may lose EUR 30 million.
Despite the withdrawal of the presidential post in 2015, his successor to WEFA, Alexander Cheferin, is still firmly committed to curb excessive costs.
“Of course, the FFP is alive, and we are moving forward to break the rules”, said the Associated Press agency Andrea Traverso, the FFP-controlled UEFA last week.
Although the IPJ is paying for the redemption of the Niamara contract simultaneously, it may distribute that amount for accounting purposes throughout the duration of its contract.
Nemir signed a five-year contract so that the transfer value could be shown in the annual accounts as a cost of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, severe sanctions were applied to the PSP, as well as to the Abu-Dabi Manchester City.
The JSP was fined at 60 million euros (after the course was 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and was scheduled to limit its team to the League of Champions during the season 2014-1015 by 21 games instead of normal 25.
WEFA monitors clubs that may try to re-examine its financial inspections by disseminating their income from companies related to the owners of the club.
Although the cash company could provide “PSG” but if the amount of funding had been higher than the standard market estimates, UEFA would not have allowed it to be considered legitimate.
That is what happened in 2014 when WEFA decided that the amount of the PSP funding was disbursed by the Qatar Tourism Office.
It was reported that part of the wage of the Niger in the IPG could be paid by the Organizational Committee of the 2022 World Championship in Qatar.
However, the IPJ and Qatar-2022 deny that Nemir will become a messenger of the campaign of peace, and such a manoeuvre could easily be identified by inspectors of WEFA.
The previous sanctions imposed on the JIU mean that WEFA will be more closely followed by any attempt to cover the rules.
As reported in the fourth person in the situation, WEFA did not hold preliminary discussions with the JIU on the transfer of the Niger.
They met with the Associated Press agency under anonymity, since they were not authorized to discuss the “PSG”.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016, the GSP received more than 10 million euros in turnover in 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have not yet been published.
The PSP expects that the arrival of Nimara will be a pleasant soil for sponsorship, the sale of attributes and football with the team's logo.
The club is expected to grow at least 30 per cent as a result of a new game.
No doubt one of the best footballers, the Spanish league has tried to mix the Nemara transfer, claiming that the PSP would violate the financial fire-play.
“This is the obvious case of the financial doping, with the club and the State,” said Spanish newspaper La Lighi Javier Tebas, meaning that the final owner of the PSP is Qatar.
Arsenala Trainer Arsen Wenger, whose club belongs to an American sports magnet, shares La League's doubts about the State's funding of the club.
“This is all the consequences of the long-term participation, and this has completely changed the Landshaft football in the last 15 years,” he said in Thursday, Wenger.
“When the club belongs to the country, it may be all.
It will be very difficult to follow the financial fair because the country may have many ways and many reasons to be presented with such a serious game.
The order and place of the oath shall be determined by the President
Where and as new Russian citizens will swear to the faithfulness of the RFB, the President will determine such amendments as the second reading of the relevant law has been developed by the Gosduma Committee on Legislation and Construction.
More than a week ago, MPs planned to determine directly how to make an oath in law.
Children up to 18 years of age will be released from prison oath, as well as inadmissibility, from the drafting text of the amendments to the draft Act entitled “On the nationality of the RF” (under the “Information”), which the Committee will consider before the second reading at its meeting on 11 July.
The idea of introducing an oath to enter the Republic of the Congo instead of formal signature of documents was supported by President Vladimir Putin on 6 June during a meeting with Mr. Weissman.
Members expressed this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading in the draft legislation to cancel a decision on the extradition of those who were subsequently convicted of a number of terrorist or extremist offences: for example, for public appeals to terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (see 2 p. 205.2), and for the sake of aircraft, travel or water transport, but only if this act is related to terrorism (see paragraph 4 of CFP).
According to the draft law, its logic was this: by drawing up documents on citizenship, a person is under a promise to comply with Russian legislation - an act of extremism, he violates that promise.
The draft law was introduced in April by the leaders of the think groups Vladimir Vasilev, Gennadi Züganov (KPRF), Vladimir Girinowski (LDPR), Sergei Mironov ( "Sergey Russia") and GD Vecheslav Volodin.
On 19 May, the MPs adopted it in the first reading.
Last week, the GD Committee on Construction and Legislation approved the text of the draft law to the second reading, but it has now been recast.
He now says that the procedure for making an oath will be set up by the President of the RF.
The former parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the Law on the Civilization of the RF, which indicated that the ceremony should be held in a state-owned condition before the Russian government and the flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the MDG.
However, the text of the draft law did not understand where such an event should take place, a list of places where the RF herb may be located, governed by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, the heads of the governing bodies of the entities, municipal education, judges, prosecutors, heads of the federal executive authorities, etc.
Most likely, this could be the SAGA.
The production of a consignee's sworn oath to obtain RF's citizenship will be after the officials check their documents.
However, the Russian passport will only be obtained after making an oath, followed by the written text.
A week ago, the project mentioned that the oath should be preceded by a signature of the order.
The updated text states that Russia will be 18 years old, not 14 years old.
A rule has been maintained that inadequacies will be released or limited, as well as those who cannot produce, read or sign the oath themselves.
In addition, the President of the RFB has the right to withdraw from this procedure and other persons,
The updated draft legislation also provides for a special procedure for adopting Russian citizens of Ukraine, who are considered Russian-language carriers.
They must be officially denied of Ukrainian citizenship by providing the relevant declaration to the competent authority of Ukraine for that purpose.
A written copy of the statement will need to be transmitted to Russian officials.
Refusal of “sighing” citizenship as it is now will not be required if it is provided by an international treaty or if it is not possible to “in the strength of persons not dependent on reasons”.
The relevant amendment to the law was proposed by a group of MPs, including the first Vice-Spice-Spirard GD Ivan Melnikov (KPRF), Natalya Poklonskaya, Paul Krascheninkov and Ayrat Farrakov (the "One Russia").
I think that many of you know that getting a deal with Ukraine is not real, just impossible.
Accordingly, many people await their decision on the nationality of the RFI, explaining the threat of the head of the thought committee on the construction and legislation of Paul Krascheninikov (ER).
In addition, the text made it clear that restrictions on the employment of certain foreign posts would not be extended to those who had refused to “other” citizenship and had given prior passports to Russia’s MDGs, but had not ceased to be regarded as a citizen of another country “without reason”.
Foreigners are now prohibited from taking office in the municipal service, being admitted to work on the facilities and in the organization that is related to the security of Russia.
Also, a person with a dual nationality or type of residence in another country cannot become a Member of the Lord or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force from 1 September 2017 and that the necessary acts should be prepared.
Nostalgia is a low in the U.S. Garden and the Detectives.
The present history is reminiscent of the glorious days of the 80th century; the era of the border in the 90th (about the time when outstanding Masters David Wayne and Michael Schovalter made a sign of "State" for MTV); and that is about 2001, before her stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Pauler and Paul Radd, moved to more serious things.
As a cultural fact, it is simultaneously the rise and fall of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as French it seems anachronism.
"The first day of camp" was a great surprise, not just because of the absurd noise (including the original story of the fruit bank, which was called by H. John Benjamin).
The result is a double shift: middle-aged actors play sexually worried children who have only reached adulthood; this makes it impossible to return to being part of the race.
Ten years later, where adults have already played, they have less deep emotional roots, and their family is more unsatisfied and include the riffs from the 90s steel films of the "Handy Flyer" type.
In one episode, the staff has Apple Powerbook, four-chool roulettes and the "skin of other things since 1991".
A lot of mixed ways are the same.
The Domino Cup (Schoolter), now the writer, has not yet got a relationship with Katie (Margarit More).
Victor (Ken Marino) hasn't grown up yet.
And there is still a foolish and foolish argument that is taking part in Ronald Reygan (also Shaulter), now underpinning George Bush-age (the tested paradigm in fulfillment of Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of French is to withdraw from it.
In particular, it is fun to see a young Radda who sings a song by Matt Dillon from the "One" character, whose ex-husband Andy looks like an old man now.
The success of this French would be possible by chance in the spirit of the "Seven Up" recursive series until it comes to its logical conclusion: "The Americas Summer: Twenty Years Later", where, in the last stage, all companies would go to the film "The Americas Summer".
The "Court Detective" of the Amazon is referred to as another type of fate: the memories of the Cold War from the Americas, the Explosive Blondie, or even the "Blessa" with its images of the fight against the East and the West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alejandro Tanako with director Riss Thomas, is a television screen: a Romanian police drama in the '80s about two police officers in Bucharest fighting for the truth, atheism and the Marxist-Lenian road.
The main roles - the life of Gregor and the idealist Joseph - are performed by Florin Persic-young and Cornelius Ulitch, and their dialogues in English with Chenning Tatum (the same executive director) and Joseph Gordon Levit.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's just an idea.
There are a few visual shots (police take time to check the chess game, as Americans can watch football).
The team of prominent voices for the frame - including Jenny Sleet, Nick Offferman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevini - allows interest in playing the "guada voice".
But this is how the "Court Detective" is supposed to be an exclusive propaganda drama -- there's even a cell phone in Ronald Reygan's mask, which often looks like it.
Six long episodes are stuck, and funny isn't very, very often.
If he were to take the lead, the "Protect" would be better able to deal with his agitative spirit, for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American Embassy, two whole people sitting in the pool carrying the bag of hamburgers.
The image of the Communist vision says that Western culture is capable of making a living.
The inspired Roman authors of the film are no longer wrong: we do so with our own recent history and with them too.
The Soperkubok Russian football match fund between Spartacom and Lokomotiv will consist of some 30 million rubs.
The President of the Russian Football Prime Minister (RFPL) Sergei Pradekin informed the press conference.
According to RFPL, the winner will receive 70 per cent of that amount, reports RT.
He also added that the tickets to the match have almost disappeared.
Match Spartak-- Lokomotiv will be on Friday, 14 July, at 21:30.
As TASS notes, Spartak is an active RF champion, and Lokomotiv is the owner of Cuba.
Two young ufims cleaned the furniture roof by 200 thousand rubles
One day, a 37-year-old criminal with a furniture company was approached by the police.
The man said that he had stolen expensive tools from the cell, which had caused serious damage to his production.
The winning barrier has become instruments of nearly 200 thousand rubles: two fronts, aperforator, a hydraulic, a lift.
The guards began to search the criminals and soon entered the inhabitants of the Blogjetten region of Baskoratstan, 23 and 24 years of age.
According to the press service of the Republic of Moldova, the reporting agents entered the territory of the undertaking, damaged the door and brought out the tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold the stolen technique to the first hit car service.
They have already been subjected to theft, and law enforcement has been able to return only part of the stolen instruments to the legal owner.
Mr. Medvedeva commented on RF-US relations
The United States and Russia must be able to work with each other.
With this statement, the official representative of Mr. Hizer Nauert responded to Prime Minister RF Dmitry Medvedev's statement on the relationship of two States.
The former head of the Russian Government stated that, with the adoption of new anti-virus sanctions, the United States had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and announced a fully-valued trade war in the RF.
Commenting on those words, Nauret recognized that Russian-American relations were “low” but noted that there was a need to seek “interventional powers”.
"Take a look at the peace on the south-west of Syria, which has been observed for nearly a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," says RIA News diplomat.
At that time, the representative of the Foreign Affairs Bureau refused to comment on the Russian Prime Minister ' s statement that sanctions were equivalent to the trade war.
The draft legislation on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the United States President Donald Tramp signed in the minority.
In doing so, he acknowledged that the document had failed and was contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior's "increased" roses from the amethysts and quarters
The French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - was filled with the collections of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
There were five new bicycles and three bicycles on the barbed wires.
Rose Dior Pré Catelan has two new wheels and columns from the amateurs, the roses room and the brilliants performed in the gliptic technique (the stone handle) and the respect and attention of the 70s.
The head of Dior Joaillerie Victoria de Castellan was inspired by the roses that developed instead of Granville, the model Christian Dior, and the Paris fields of Bagatel and Pre-Catelan.
Tramp found perpetrators of the deterioration of relations with Russia
President Donald Trump of the United States made a serious criticism of the members of the convention.
In the opinion of the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relationship with Russia is at a low and dangerous level.
"You can thank the Congress, these people can't even give us medicine," wrote the president on Twitter.
The persecution of Donald Tramp signed a new sanctions law against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
They are, in particular, affected by Russian banks and energy companies.
The White House subsequently issued a statement by the President, which indicated that the law would not allow the United States to conclude useful transactions and to be closer to the RF, China and North Korea.
The Belarusian entrepreneur refused to buy the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank
The company from Belarus, Victor Prokopenje, withdrew from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) a request for the purchase of Sberbank's subsidiary.
A businessman explained his decision to the NCB to “focus on the other of our planned investments and projects on which we work”.
Mr. Prokopeni said that such a step would be “more time-consuming” despite the investment attractiveness of buying Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokopenja became the main bidder for the purchase of the Russian Bank unit in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application in July of the NorvikBank Consortium of Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Guzerieva.
The Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after the President of the country, Peter Poroshenko, imposed sanctions on their subsidiary structures in March.
One of these financial organizations, other than the WTB and the Foreign Bank, became Sberbank.
Money called the reason for the blackout in Kremlin.
In the Ministry of Energy, the RF mentioned the reason for the blackout in Crimea.
The head of the department, Alexander Novak, made comments on the case.
According to him, the islands remained without electricity because of the road transport incident in the territory of Krasnodar.
As a result of the removal of Cuban and related Russian networks from the power line in the DTP, the cargo of the power line has fallen into the DTP.
The power supply concerns of large Russian cities were fixed last week.
Specialists have been removing gaps for several hours.
It was first reported that the cause of the blockade could be an anomaly.
The Bank of England maintains interest rates at 0.25 per cent
It is expected that the Bank of England will later declare that the percentage rates will not change after the weak economic growth and declining inflation have forced the hearings of possible increases.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain unsatisfying and left interest rates unchanged in the rising pressure on family income.
The Bank's Monetary and Credit Policy Committee (MPC) specialists voted in response to 6 to 2 maintenance rates at 0.25 per cent this month, with the lower number of members of the Committee calling for an increase in the rate, as weak economic growth weakened the support of the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank has limited its projections to an increase of 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018 and has warned that family income pressure will continue, while it is still expected that inflation will rise to about 3 per cent.
The Bank, however, warned that the increase in rates in the next few years would be necessary to control the inflation caused by brexit inflation, and said that the cost of borrowing would likely have to be higher than expected on the financial markets.
The members of the Committee also voted in favour of withdrawing from the part of the civil package of measures for the development of the economy launched last year after the crisis.
Since February, the Bank has been closing the emergency financing plan for which it has provided banks with cash, although it has reported that it is now in the framework of the plan to provide another 15 billion dollars, up to 115 billion dollars.
In the Bank's decision-making protocol, he said: “The growth of gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to be slow in the near future, while the pressure on real income continues to affect consumption”.
On the question of the rate, he reiterated that, in order to stop inflation, there would be a need for “some financial policy” to be “a little higher” than the market expected.
At this point, the market is expected to grow first in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that all increases would be “progressed” and “limited”.
The Bank's projections for increase in this year and the next year are lower than the projections made in May, which were 1.9% and 1.7%.
The Bank left its unchanged forecast for 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After these news, Sterling fell for the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell to 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was taken after recent adverse growth rates were weakened by higher expectations; the GDP grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter against 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, growth, judgment, overall, remains at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it is beginning to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The last report of the Bank on inflation provided little cause for the happiness of households with high inflation and a slight increase in wages: the bank said that pressure would be hard to reduce.
The Bank added that the financial policy “cannot prevent” has been successful in the next few years, but it is expected that payments will return to the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also driven by increasing demand for British goods due to the low rate of money, which compensates for some of the lower consumption costs.
The decision was taken a year after the rate was reduced to 0.25 per cent in last August after the shocking results of the Eurojust's dropout referendum.
The Bank estimates that, in almost all cases, it will take four years to fully affect prices and the economy.
Before the bank had made its last decision on the rates, it had grown to the noise around the proposed increase in rates, as inflation had increased to such a strong pressure on households: three experts in the Committee had asked for a higher rate of 0.5 per cent in July.
In the past month, inflation fell to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in July, although the bank reported that the fall was expected and was reimbursed in the coming months.
According to the bank, a higher rate than planned 2 per cent was the result of a low rate of money.
Andrew Montleyk, director of the Coréco mortgage brokers company, said: "If the recent drop in rates is taken into account, the mortgage market will become even more competitive, as creditors require business opportunities and count on the good end of the year.
The market seems particularly favourable to those who are approaching the end of their existing treaties, such as the refinancing of loans, often with the absence of the Commission, and with a low rate, become popular as never before.”
The State Health Service has lost 10,000 HIV-related drug disputes
Since September, patients will have access to a “revolving” HIV prevention device after a battle in the High Court on the financing of a remedy from the Public Health Service.
The National Health Service of England announced that the pre-exposure HIV prevention (PREP) tablet, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in the risk group, will now provide health services for about 10,000 people during the initial three-year trial period.
She agreed to finance the trial after the appeal court upheld the High Court's decision last year, which claimed that the National Health Service had the opportunity to pay the PRSP, despite her statement that it had to be financed by local authorities.
This step announced on Thursday was called “the most important innovation” by the President of the National Health Service of England by Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Board (NAT) called it “the turning point”.
Prior to the full launch of the programme throughout England by April 2018, the ventriloquists in London, Briton, Manchester, Liverpool and the Sheffield will begin to register, and more fans will join the programme in October.
Predeposition prevention (PREP) is a course of HIV preparations taken to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
As studies have shown, PEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among risk groups.
With the adoption of PREP before sex in the human body, there is sufficient number of certain preparations to prevent HIV infection.
Such preparations can be taken daily or not later than two hours before sex.
Patients entitled to preparation include gay and bisexual men, transgenders and people whose partners are HIV positive and do not receive successful treatment.
The sponsors will select appropriate participants who agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transmitters and individuals whose partners are unaware of whether their HIV status is controlled by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and enrolled in general practice in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in a nearby ventriloquist dispancer participating in the programme.
The programme will amount to 10 million pounds, and the National Health Service of England signed a procuring treaty this week after the international tender for procurement.
The study is designed to assess all the possibilities of PREP by collecting clinical data on who is the target audience of the preparation, its identity and its large-scale application.
“This important innovation must complement and strengthen the broad and more successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another pitfall for more than three decades of success in combating one of the greatest health threats facing mankind.
Debor Gold, President of NAT (National AIDS Control Board), said: “This is a turning point in combating HIV.
The PEP, if it is educationally aimed at people in need and at risk, will allow for a change in the situation of HIV epidemics in England.
Since September, people in the HIV risk group, through this study conducted in England by the National Health Service, will have access to a new open-source means that a person can control without discussing it with a partner, which will improve many lives.
We warmly welcome this news."
Jan Green, President of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “It is now first of all necessary to ensure that the test is rapidly deployed throughout the country, and that none of the HIV risk groups are forgotten.
Now that we are provided with an experimental pre-EP equipment, we will come to protect more than 10,000 people at the risk zone of HIV”.
The Minister for People's Health Sharon Hodgeson said: “We very welcome the start of the PEP test, which has been very late for months and a break by the Government.”
The data show how revolutionary this can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and the elimination of this annual infection.
This test will bring us closer to the full understanding of the advantages of the PRSP.
It is now important that the test be as rapidly developed as possible throughout the country to protect those at risk of HIV and to further move us towards the end of the spread of HIV in society.
The World Congress of the Father adopted a resolution on the support of the Treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The Sixth Meeting of the World Congress of the Fathers (WCT) adopted a resolution that noted the importance of maintaining the position of the President in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is “a positiveally recommended form of the organization of the highest government in the Republic and expressing the national interests of all the Tatar people”.
In addition, the meeting stressed the importance of the treaty on the delimitation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he “has played a positive role in the ethnic, socio-economic and political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole”.
The Treaty between Moscow and Kazakhstan has been concluded for 10 years since 24 July 2007.
On 11 July, the Members of Mr. Tatarstan requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and maintain the appointment of the head of the region.
Tatarstan is now the only entity that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only position known as the “President”.
There were difficulties in obtaining international driving rights in Russia
The GIBDD units have experienced a lack of international driving licences (ITUs).
In order to obtain such rights, it must be expected for several weeks, which has become a problem for vacationers who want to go to the back of their car or take a break there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving licences remains controversial.
The ITU was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written in the national certificate, as the information was explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are recorded in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Movement, but in the countries that ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian law is recognized.
However, the case is all dependent on specific police or procuratories: some require VAT and someone has sufficient national rights.
In order to ensure that international rights are still obtained, it should be taken into account that, in non-ratified countries (e.g., the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have no right to recognize national rights or VAT.
The problem with whites is now being monitored practically in all GIBDD units, reports Commersant, conducting research in a number of regions.
Yes, in Moscow, in the UGIDDD units, talent is simply not issued, and the blanks are no longer four months away.
It can be recorded on the website of the guest, but it has grown there before mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is not possible to obtain “technical reasons” without further details, in the Samaria area, it is honest to say that there are no whites, the situation is similar in other cities.
Many Muslims have already faced the problem, and the following reports are increasingly reported:
Irina Burmistrova: "Remember why there is no access to international rights in Moscow?"
That's right, because all the branches of the GIBDD have finished.
Elena Podcolzina: "Question for people who know!"
International rights must be obtained very quickly.
In Moscow it's always gone far ahead, the talons don't give out at all (a button is, but the talent cannot be given).
The kind of portal of the guest shows that in Spb time free to the fit.
Did anyone try to get in another town?
He's working?
As explained in the IMF, the requirements for international driving licences have changed, so new blanks are provided in the Gosavton Inspection Unit.
This and may be related to a deficit, the truth, is unclear what changes have been made, which have not been reported previously.
Banks purchases the Road Safety Special Assignment Centre (CSN BDD) MVD RF and then puts them in the GIBD Unit.
In recent years, all contracts have been concluded with the OO Goznak: almost 200 thousand pages have been made in 2014-2015, 15 thousand pages have been purchased in 2016, 90 thousand have been purchased in 2017, but the last contract has been concluded on 18 July with the OO " First Printed House" for the production of 70,000 pages.
There is a version that the CSN simply failed to make time for a tender, which is why and the result of a deficit.
In addition, there are other versions of the lack of blanks: because of the crisis, many people have become independent, not in Europe, but in larger Asian countries -- China, Thailand and so on.
What rights are recognized there until the end is unclear, so people are frightened, so there is an urgent demand for international "steps".
It has recently been known that professional leaders will have to pass an examination to confirm their qualifications.
This proposal was made by Mintrans.
The international driving licence (ITU) of the new model has been valid since 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine, Paul Peterenko, stated that he would not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
On Friday, 4 August, he said in an interview at the Ombudsperson Portal.
No respected international company will even put a bullet or a trap there because it is at risk of losing its business in the territory of the EU, the United States, Japan, in countries that have acceded to sanctions against Russia on Crime.
"It is, in my deep conviction, that there is no prospect of this project," said Petroenko.
He added that Russia considered it impossible to carry out a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot properly build even less large objects.
I know that after the Olympics in Soci, all the stadiums have already been destroyed.
"That is why, I think, the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that have become so invisible to join the project," the officer noted.
On 31 July, the builders completed the construction of the railway ship at the Crimea Bridge.
The main collection of the railway ship of the Crimea Bridge is completed on the Kerchen Bank: it is closed at a height of 45 metres from the foundation of the construction.
"At the same time, the trainers prepared a railway boat for the installation of colouring boards," they reported to the information centre of the project.
In April, the head of Mintrans Maxim Sokolov informed President Vladimira Putin that the construction of the project was in the course of planning.
The Kremlin bridge unites the Crimean Peninsula and the Krasnodar Region.
In Spain, a worker who did not work for 10 years was fired
What angelic patience (or absolute indivisibility to the public service) should have been held by Spanish officer Carles Rexio?
The permanent decline lasted for 10 years.
In contrast, Mr. Resio was still released.
But not his direct boss.
What's not happening in the world of bureaucrats.
The inhabitants seem to have been accustomed to all the jokes of "the servant of the people" for a long time.
Nevertheless, officials can always be surprised at what they do not live in a bad way.
This time, the "sensation" came from Spain.
There, a staff member of the Valencia Carles Resio's archive has been confused for ten years not to go to work.
In doing so, he received a regular apology.
It's a total of 50 thousand euros a year.
And now Mr. Resio's "frequency times" is over.
It was approved by the Valence Legislative Assembly.
The investigation revealed that every morning the criminal prosecutor came to the office at 07:00 to report to the electronic system.
And here he went home.
Once again, he appeared at work at 16:00 to notice again what he was going through.
And then 10 years.
It has also been noted that every free time the miner has dedicated his house - to - house comics.
The members of the Valencia Legislative Assembly are now thinking about how to punish and punish the direct head of Mr. Regio, who could not know how to "work actively" at his workplace.
The Courts propose to protect the Presidents
The Presidential Human Rights Council (HR) on the Order of Vladimira Putin developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The PSC proposes to limit the powers of the Presidents of the Tribunal and to introduce their elections.
The Court of Appeals and Cassation of the PSCs wishes to introduce special areas that will not be bound to the administrative and territorial action in the RFF.
Its proposals under the Presidential Order should also be submitted by the Supreme Court.
The PSC has completed the development of proposals that will enhance the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by the PSC on 3 January 2017 by Vladimira Putin, who was appointed by the President after a meeting of the Council.
The meeting with the members of the Council on 8 December 2016 was discussed, including individual cases of judicial leave, as well as problems of public control at the places of detention of civilians (see “E” of 9 December).
As a result of the work of the PSC, 25 proposals were made on the issue of the independence of judges and the identification of judicial errors, as well as on the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of Kremlin human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the Presidents of the Court to improve the independence of the other judges.
If the candidate at the trial post has successfully passed the contest and has received support from the judiciary, the President of the Court, in his opinion, should submit him to appointment without the right to refuse as permitted by the law.
It is also proposed to deprive the President of the right to divide cases between judges.
This can be done by experts, a specially written computer program.
It was also considered that the President would not have the right to " determine the results of the judge's qualification assessment, to initiate his involvement in disciplinary responsibility, to take decisions on the establishment of additional material payments".
In this connection, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to “the election of the Presidents of the Tribunals themselves” and “to exercise their powers for a relatively short period of compulsory rotation”.
All the Presidents of the Tribunals (from republican to regional) are now appointed for six years by the President of the Supreme Court of the RF.
In order to compensate judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the PSC proposes to reorganise appeals and cassation in the courts of the Common Jurisdiction.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative and territorial action in the RF.
The PSC said that “there is a need to ensure that individual courts are organized, not at the level of the judicial authorities in the RFFs, but in the judiciary areas”.
Experts are based on the practice of arbitral tribunals.
There are “judgment areas” that do not correspond to the administrative division in the RF, but which ensure greater independence from regional officials, which are difficult to use “telephone rights”.
World judges have been invited to strengthen national parliamentarians to consider with their participation some of the “Citizen and administrative categories”.
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, the restoration of employment, the protection of dignity and dignity, the loss of driving rights, etc.
"It's just our proposals," explained a member of the PSC, judge of the Constitutional Court in the case of Tamara Mortakov.
She also recalled that the president ' s order was not only related to the PSC but also to the Supreme Court (WS), which had not yet made its proposals.
There is still time to implement the mandate of the WC (between the Executives - the Genocortate and the Human Rights Officer in the RF).
To report to Vladimmir Putin on the extent to which justice independence is effectively guaranteed in the FF, the President of the WS Vecheslav Lebedev should be held by 1 September.
Living a life of high quality: the landscape and the fast design acceptances turned this little apartment into a living room in Earls Cort
Joan Lee, an ex-banker involved in the real estate repair, moved from a space house to Natsbridge in 2014 to an Erles Cortt apartment.
The apartment is in the first stage of the typical house in Queen Anna's style, and the new design says that Joan didn't pick up his things and didn't move again.
“I used to live with my former life in Natsbridge in a much larger area, ” says Joan.
"I wanted something to compare with my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were the same high schools here.
I fell in love with her and offered her a price on the same day."
From the time of the first review of the square in 1000 square feet, complete reconstruction has been carried out.
It was a room with one of the bedrooms, to fall into the bedroom, to go through the kitchen, and Joanna wanted to add space to store the matter and to enjoy the maximum benefit from the generous height of the beds.
"I wanted high tides, big windows, lots of light.
These were my demands," she says.
To that end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Notting Hill of the "Duck & Shed" architecture studio to use a 12.5 foot-high and create a residence that would not only be a successful project but would delight Joan for life.
The flood was not high enough to build two spaces above each other, so the structural task was to create a landfill where full growth could be achieved.
Erfan came to think of the designers to deal with the bridge.
"Work with permanent structures is very difficult," he explains.
“They had to have such a place in order to be above each other, and they did not have to lose.
It was not just to build a simple platform, but to replace the structures so that they are at the right height and allow use of upper and lower spaces."
This decision allowed Erfan to build two fully-sized rooms over one another in the remote area — and much more interesting.
From the side of the bottle, a soft light window from Retrouvius is opened on the side of the guest window below.
The silver furniture with the gold section, silver accents and the glass lamps from Serja Muya are designed for the style of the project.
The use of the circle plays a role in adding gravity, space and light.
The short corridor is lined with circles to say longer.
On the kitchen, the mirror protection panel looks like a window in another room.
In the entrance, the cervical wards serve to preserve Joan's entire crew.
In order to create a feeling of greater space, the beauty of the guest may burn itself into a kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new in the kitchen.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's moving up the door like in the garage.
“Erfan has been involved in engineering here,” says Erfan about the armored chair of the wooden-walled protective door.
"It is uplifted by opposition, so when you knock on the door, it will be very easy for you."
Thanks to the reasonable use of space and storage facilities, Joan received additional 16 square meters, additional bedroom and improved planning.
“At the end of the day, half of it is what you will sell, but it is what you will not be able to do.”
“I strongly say that an agent for trafficking in real estate will come in and produce accounts on the basis of sex”.
Here they were able to increase the area by using quality materials that contribute to the growing area of the area.
“Material is what we draw, so they help create emotional ties with the house,” says Erfan.
“No one likes electricity in walls.
It is important, but it does not affect the strength of our hearts."
This is evidence that because of the fine design and the increased metric of the apartment, it is possible to turn from something normal to something boring.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government approved the establishment of a cultural policy commission
The Government of Russia approved the establishment of a Commission on Public Cultural Policy.
The relevant decision is published on the Government ' s website.
According to the document, the main task of the Commission will be to develop and correct strategic approaches to cultural policy implementation.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policies, clarify the objectives and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The Main Committee is appointed by the Vice-President of the Government of the RF.
The composition of the Commission will be approved separately.
Prime Minister RF Dmitry Medvedev adopted a plan for the implementation of the State Cultural Policy strategy by 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and provides measures to increase the influence of Russian culture in other countries, to preserve the single cultural area and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to the development of conditions for cultural development in the country.
Inflation in G20 has decreased to an eight-year minimum
The growth in consumer prices in G20 countries has decreased to the lowest in the last eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal, referring to the OECD data.
According to OECD estimates, inflation rates in June 2016 were 2 per cent lower than in October 2009 when the price increase index reached 1.7 per cent.
Rostat previously reported a reduction in the consumer price index in Russia by 0.1 per cent.
Thus, the Department had established the first weekly deflatation in 2017.
The rate of inflation in Russia, according to Minfina, is 4.1 per cent.
The mini-economics, however, believe that the target value already reached is 4 per cent in the version of this department.
The path of the warning from the illegal take-off of the bivalve taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin, during a meeting on environmental development in the natural bivalve territory, warned of the illegal destruction of forests.
In the course of the activities of the Minister of Natural Resources Sergey Donsk noted that a bill had been prepared earlier.
It allows wood to be cut off at the time of the fire and the Government plans to adopt it already.
In turn, the President stated that the project should be followed in order to “do not break all the rules”.
Donkey noted that this bill was subject to control by the ICP and the supervisory agencies.
Media: U.S. soldiers are secreted from the command with Dombass militias
On the lines of armed resistance in Donbass, a regular telephone connection has been established.
The opponents of the opposing parties are constantly communicating with each other on cell phones, and they are not aware of this in the headquarters.
The U.S. Warsmen and General Donbass have set up a secret on hundreds of phones from their high command.
On 4 August, "Strana.ua" reported on the military operations in Donbass.
According to the publication, the officers of the units are well aware of the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them every day by telephone.
The community is not at all domestic: the commanders are trying to achieve some "actic arrangements".
The outcome of such talks is partly a conflict at a certain point in the front.
Journalists have been informed of the cases when a person or other officer received a greeting on the date of his birth from his formal enemy.
The U.S. Warsmen and the DNR and LNR commanders are sitting on the border line since September 2014, when Ukraine launched a war operation against Donbass.
The MDG prevented the blockade of UNCW statements on attacks on the RF Mission
The Russian Foreign Office is reimbursed by the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives who block United Nations statements in press condemning the terrorist attacks of the RF mission in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian MD.
The Bureau recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on 2 August three times a month had been bombed by the terrorist groups Hayat Tahrir Ash-Sham (formerly Jabhat An-Nursa, banned in the RF) and File Ar-Rahman.
In view of the fact that the international community is united in the status of "Nursi" as a terrorist organization, and UN resolutions called on the UNCDF to counter this structure, the MID RF noted that "it would be quite understandable that Nursi's tactics should meet with a general and decisive condemnation and that there should not be any ambiguity in the assessment of allegations against diplomatic missions".
However, as stressed in the Diplomatic Assembly, “the third time in the month of the United States, Great Britain, France and Ukraine in the United Nations Security Council, however, by varying the intensity of objections, covering evidence of the lack of necessary information, blocked the Russian Federation's proposal to adopt a standard draft Security Council statement for the press condemning the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital.”
The unwillingness to show diplomatic solidarity with us is left to those delegations.
“The overwhelming fact that the failure of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists to new provocations and tactics gives them a sense of impunity,” they stated in the IMD, adding that “it would not have been necessary to create a belief that someone in the Security Council would join them.”
Vladimir Putin expressed a limitation on the number of in-depth business checks
President Vladimir Putin of Russia at an investment project meeting in the Far East stated that the number of unplanned inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30 per cent of the planned number, as well as said the need to limit the time of ten-day inspections.
“In-depth checks are usually carried out without the appropriate consent of the prosecutor; only 2-3 per cent agree with the prosecutor, and the rest go alone,” TASS quoted President.
Vladimir Putin also said that it was necessary to prevent investigators from exaggerating servers and hard drives on businesses.
In addition, the President considers that business associations should have the right to protect the interests of their members in court.
“This, I hope, will make a certain position in dealing with cases of business activities or violations of the law in the field of business”, the head of State said.
As E reported, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is increasing due to the action of the moratorium on the carrying out of the planned checks.
A review was conducted in May with the President of Russia, Boris Titova, as a result of the fact that there was a replacement of plans for unplanned checks (from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), prosecutors (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), radio (from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent), as well as civilian declarations (from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and administrative investigations (10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).

Brothers are fighting for the immortality of the world of more than $500 million
Two brothers fought for one of the largest in Victorian empires in trade in real estate, worth more than $500 million, 40 years after their Italian predecessors founded democracy.
Former director of the Carlton Football Club and founder Colin de Lutis live in the Turkish court through three doors from his younger brother, Paul, who filed an appeal to the Supreme Court for the division of powers and assets.
Paul wants to get out of family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court still has a serious dispute about divorce conditions.
Together with Anna’s mother, her brother, she owned 87 items worth more than half a billion dollars purchased since her family bought a Smith Street store in Collingwood in 1973.
The family founded Westco Jeans, which grew up in a network of 160 trading points.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was put in place, and the list of family authorities of De Louis includes today's official buildings, apartments in Brunswick and Sorrento, the Golden Beach apartments and Mount Buller and the shopping centers in the gardens.
According to the agreement with the late father Colin, whom Paul describes as the "main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Louis family, he owns about two thirds of the company's assets, and Paul is about one third.
According to the court, Colina's property was 316 million and Paul-176 million.
The property and money section became the front stone for Paul.
"The section proposed by Colin gives it, in my view, the best part of the property," he wrote in his first statement in 2015.
Last Friday after several failed attempts to make peace, the first hearings were held in the Supreme Court.
The brothers now argue about who will control the existing business - from which Paul thought Colin excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not so, but accuses Paul of mismanagement of certain objects.
In the evidence presented by Colin at the beginning of the process, he said that he hoped to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me think of the family as the highest priority," he wrote.
The judicial costs are rising as a snowmound: hundreds of pages of evidence, electronic letters and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer have been attracted by the best known lawyers, including the King's lawyer, Allah Myers, and the best strikers.
Ms. De Louis and her late husband, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy; in the late 1950s they managed milk bars and restaurants, and in the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
Under the financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family store of Jins.
Colin says he ran Westco when he was "in the last classes of schools, and Paul was a boy (about 10 years old) then."
Anna De Louis says that they and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to transfer their power to their children without conflict.
"Louiji often told me that he didn't want his brother to be in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Louis company; Colina says that Mark received 10 million when he left the business and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark were “unsatisfied by the financial conditions of their office”.
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former board member of the AFL Club Directors and, according to the 2015 edition of Eddie McGira, the best star.
"Ferfax Media" was connected on Friday with Colin and Paul and their lawyers.
He answered only Colin, a text message that said that since the case had not been before the court, "I have something to say".
"I'm very sorry that my brother Paul decided to seek against me and bring our family's name in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in evidence that he was trying to meet the brother’s demands.
"Our father wouldn't want to see us argue in court with Paul," he said, adding that "there's still hope of resolving the conflict."
On Friday, that hope, we can see, grew apart.
"The decision will be made by the court soon," Colin wrote.
The new Head of the Trapa apparition plans to limit the access of information to the President.
Others have tried to do so and have suffered an injury.
Maybe John F. Kelly's gonna do it.
In that case, he'll be the first.
"Politico" reports that the new head of the White House apparator is planning to limit the flow of information coming to President Trampo, including news from the media, with the hope of keeping the head in a more peaceful position.
That's what reporter Josh Doussy reports.
"At a meeting held by the new head of the White House appetizer, John F. Kelly, with the leadership of the appetizer on his first working day, he identified the main problem in the White House with President Donald Trampe, which he hoped to resolve: bad channels of information access to the President."
Kelly told the staff that information should be passed through it, in a book form or by briefings, because the president would be better able to make decisions if he was to receive the correct information.
Diagnosis Kelly is perfectly faithful, but others have already suffered a failure by trying to calm the tramp following his arrival.
President Trampa's relationship with television had been established a few decades ago - and now that he is in the White House, his habit of watching television remains strong.
"When Tripp, as a candidate, rebuffed the campaign with unjust lighting, it was useful to demonstrate to him that he had received a fair light in publications that could be won," said Sam Nanberg, former electoral head adviser in February "Politico".
Tara Palmer then wrote in "Politico" that "in the words of the six former electoral headquarters members, to maintain the habit of writing on Twitter, it was necessary to monitor the continuous flow of information to him. "
Okay.
But the idea that Trampa's habit of writing on Twitter was ever "under control", just funny.
Maybe these electoral headquarters members know something we don't know, for example, that if they don't, Trampa's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets that Tramp hasn't published.
If his staff protected him from trouble several times, their efforts were not wasted.
But no one was always able to stop the tramp from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into opposing factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by giving the Treaty of Material - reliable or not - which confirms their views.
"Politico" - as once in history - wrote in May on the duty of advisers to keep the President informed of any doubt.
One example is described by the reporter Shane Goldmaher:
“Current and former staff members of the Trapa say that the tramp can react very severely to negative press reports, especially with dangerous leaks, and will not be relieved until they find out who is behind them.
This happened at the end of February, when someone suggested to the President a print of the article with GotNews.com, the Internet site of attorney Charles C. Johnson, in which the deputy chief of Katy Welsh's app was accused of "sitting for a few runaways" in the White House.
It is not important that Johnson is forever forbidden in Twitter for aggressive conduct, that he did not present specific facts or that in the past he made false accusations and then refused them.
The tramp read the article and agreed to ask the staff about Welsh."
Goldmaher adds that the then head of Reins Pribus and the secretary of Rob Porter's apparatus “was trying to build a system to manage and document the flow of the books that Tramp receives.”
How did it work?
Three months later Kelly tried to do the same.
He may appear to be more effective than Pribus, but Trampa still has an impulsive nature, and its assistants continue to fight each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly a very difficult task.
Tumen province is fighting HIV-dissident
The prosecutor challenged the Order of the Kalinian Court of Tumani, which had terminated the criminal case against the local population, where a young girl was killed by HIV.
As a result, the child died because his mother was a HIV-dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court released her from liability for reconciliation with the injured father.
The Prosecutor believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished so as not to create a precedent for other HIV-dissidents.
The case against the inhabitants of Tumeni was resumed at 1 p. 109 P.C.R. (cause of inattentive death) in April - after the death of her three-year-old daughter from HIV infection at 4V.
According to the prosecutor, the mother itself is HIV-infected.
"The woman did not treat herself and refused to treat her, believing that the HIV infection did not exist," they explained in the Tumen province.
The criminal case took place in the Kalinian Court of the Tumeni, which decided on 25 July to terminate it.
The application was made by the father of the lost girl, explaining that “he forgave the woman, the claims she did not have, she was hurt and apologized”.
The court ' s decision did not agree and appealed, requiring the decision to terminate the case and to send it to a new trial.
The girl died, and it was impossible to freeze the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, despite the doctor's recommendations, refused to investigate and treat the baby from a dangerous infection," she reported to the prosecutor's press office.
In the view of the supervisory body, it should be punished, or, for example, followed by other HIV-dissidents.
As told in the Tuman Center for AIDS, about 12 children with HIV are currently not receiving medical assistance because of parental refusal.
"And this situation has already improved - in the year of the work of a special group of parents who have categorically refused to treat children from HIV, have changed their mind - have made diagnosis and have become ready," said the press secretary of the Center for AIDS Elena Loseva.
She said that it was impossible to influence parents by law, and as a result not all HIV-infected children could be found, mothers would not be able to investigate, hide, run away with children from the hospital.
How dangerous HIV-dissidents are
At the end of last year, the Petersburg sociologists submitted the results of the first study of the so-called HIV-dissident movement in Russia.
HIV-dissidents call people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take drugs.
The health authorities and health activists of the NCO call such anti-medicals, and their distribution poses a serious threat.
The cold photo session, which ended with the tragedy, took place on Thursday, 3 August, at the Greek railway station in Hemelnik.
The pleasure of the young people who were under the yoke was lost on the railways, where the freight trip once stood.
One of his friends had the idea of making an effective car crew, who had reported Factam in the Hemmelica police communication sector.
The couple began walking from the bridge to the train, but because of their invisibility, they were trapped in the line of the helicopter and immediately hit.
Fortunately, the case became known as the station's dissident, which immediately called the emergency.
Before the visit of the injured doctor, they were transferred to a safe place and then hospitalized at the Hmelnician Hospital.
Men were diagnosed with 1 to 2 lung cancers.
Now his condition is assessed by doctors as stable.
The defenders recall that in recent times there has been a growing popularity of extremists on cross-country crossings, bridges moving in transport.
The police call on people to be cautious and to avoid such photos, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have allowed the existence of oceans in ancient Venezuela
The oceans could have existed in ancient Venus.
The French scientists expressed such a view.
Experts have created a computer model that has demonstrated the process of water education on the surface of the planet, says Science News.
It has been found that in Venezuela, at the beginning of her history, the oceans, where there were 10 per cent more water than at present on Earth.
Previously, the "Arguments of Weeks" wrote that, according to scientists ’ hypothesis, ocean 4 billion years ago could have existed on Mars.
In their studies, foreign specialists concluded that the water object was located in the northern half of the Red Planet.
Three people were injured as a result of the shooting in the park in San Francisco
In San Francisco, three people were injured by the shooting, transmitted by the Associated Press.
The incident occurred in the Dolores Park, where there were a large number of visitors.
According to the witnesses, a number of men at the bridge began to cry out threats.
One of them took his weapon and started shooting at people.
The outward appearance of criminals could not be considered as if they had closed everything except their eyes.
Another medical assistance was provided after his release.
The third victim is a minor, and there is no details about his condition.
The Dolores Park hall is a popular place for local residents and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 people were injured during a night club in the city of Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several more visitors were injured, trying to leave the room.
The Louna Rock Group will present a new album in Barnaule
The Louna Rock Group concert will be held in Barnaule on 17 October.
The musicians will present their new album "The Divine New World", which has become one of the most expected events of the year.
The collection prepares a conceptual show, which will become the clearest in the group's concert history.
The "new world" is the fourth Russian rock band album.
His name is linked to the famous novelist O. Haxley "On a strange new world".
The new songs are not reprinting the book, but they tell about a society that lives under the law of Antitype, “the blind faith of propaganda and the boundless values. ”
The audience helped to collect money on the band album: more than 1200 people were supported on the Planeta.ru project website.
Her first album "Sdela Gromche!" was released in 2010.
Two years later, musicians presented the "Time X" poster, and in 2013 they wrote the album "We - It's Louna" (2013).
In autumn 2015, the Louna Group spoke with the Symphony Orchestra at Cross City Hall with the "Peace Song" program.
In the group of Luciné Gevorkyan (vocal), Vitaly Demidenko (bas-gitara), Ruben Kazariyan (gitara), Sergei Ponkratev (gitara), Leonid Kinzburski (Barabana).
The concert will be held at the Barnival Club of Pharaoh on 17 October at 19 a.m.
Ticket price: 1200 to 2600 rubles.
Louna is one of the most advanced groups on the Russian rock scene.
The collection was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert took place in 2009.
The group has won several times in various hit-paradises of the Fourth Deguine.
Cigarettes crossed the border and returned to the “Millions Street”
Some of the most complex households in the West Midland are again in conflict with the giant giants who have overrun the expensive municipal authorities to take over the field with their homes.
Cigarettes parked 20 homes on the streets, bordering the rich street of Solikhalla, receiving the ridiculous name "Millions Street".
When they brought the bad ones, the young men, and many of the houses on the wheels, they returned after they had been driven away in May and had not mixed the blood stolen by the municipal authorities to prevent their entry.
The tactical company found a break in the defensive equipment and opposed its vehicles to evaporating areas, which were not limited to leaving room for the tropin.
Explanatory residents attacked the municipality of Solikhal, saying that it had become “unsolved to solve this problem”.
An anonymous local resident reported: “They came here on Monday, after they had been driven from Bentley Heit, where they had cast stones in the past.”
The municipality should respect and cease to act because it is not fully able to address the problem.
They were here in May, they missed them, and they came back here again.
Last night, there was even more Zigan, and today, perhaps even more.
“Municipalities of Birmingham know how to solve this problem, they receive long-term judicial decisions to protect their parks”, she added.
I live on Stritsbruk Road, and I do not like that I continue to pay municipal taxes, and the municipality can't even put an end to this."
One of the local people who wanted to stay anonymous said, "This is ridiculous. We have only seen how these giants are moving in the past, and here, please, this attack continues."
And this time there was more to them, and we even saw the evil turn of fortune.’
The representative of the municipality of Solikhalla said: “We know of an illegal camp on the ground along the Stritsbruk Road and we cooperate with the Solikhal police; we take the necessary legal action to prevent them as soon as possible.”
In order to help us collect evidence, it is very important that as many local people as possible report any antisocial or criminal conduct to the police by telephone 101.
This allows us to draw up a report on the situation that will be considered by the court when we present our case to them.
Crem acts as the company of champagne wines "New World"
The GUP of the Republic of Crimea, "The New World Treaty of Champagne Wine", decided to act, turning into the OAO " The New World Law of Champagne Wine", should be directed by the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crime Anna Anuhin.
100 per cent of business shares will remain owned by Crimea.
The capital of the shareholders' society will be 595.5 million rubs and will be of 5,955 million fines of a nominal value of 100 rubs each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crime stated that if there is no means to modernise the enterprise within the next three years, the risk of stopping the undertaking would be jeopardised.
The main export of funds to enterprises is 60 to 70 per cent.
The modernization of enterprises requires 1.2 billion rupees, which is obliged to pay 50 per cent of the income of the budget due to organizational legal requirements.
What remains is insufficient to implement the modernization plan.
"To get money from the owner in trouble, to talk about attracting loan funds from large credit organizations is difficult," Prime Minister Crimea Sergey Petelin said in April of this year.
The Krima Parliament included the company in the forecast privatization plan for 2017.
It was proposed to take stock of it and place it on the market.
The source of Interfax in the authorities of Crimea estimated the possible cost of sales of businesses to $40 million, investors' contributions to modernization - another $30 million.
The New World has increased the production of toys by 2.8% in 2016 compared to 2015 - up to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017 the New World intended to release 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by the Prince of the Left Golithian as a wine-producing facility in his possession of the New World.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
The lower secondary schools were over 40 graveyards
The GU MWD staff in the region of the Netherlands have established the identity of citizens who have destroyed 46 graves in the city of Lískovo.
A third - grade class was held by criminals.
The first statement that the mollusc plates were damaged was made by the Russian Federation on 27 June.
In that regard, 24 persons were sent to the police.
As a result, a criminal case was brought to light under article 244 of the CFF "Damination, damage or excretion of the place of burial".
As a result, the police found suspects, two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
Juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing the memory fall, and that prompted them to act as huligans.
Children and their parents have taken preventive measures.
Italy is overcrowded with regard to NGOs ships saving migrants.
Italy warned NGOs that rescue vessels in the Mediterranean would not be able to continue their work without new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs are not subject to a new code of conduct, it is difficult to say if they can continue their activities," said Minister of the Interior of Mario Minniti in the Turkish daily newspaper Stampa.
The warning of Miniti was sounded the next day after the Italian authorities confiscated the ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet, suspected that its ship was actually cooperating with human trafficking and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, throughout the year, rejected comments on the substance of the detailed charges made against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrojo Cartozio.
“There is a high priority to human life for us, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue to work in the search and rescue area now,” the organization said in summary.
“We can assess all the charges that have been raised now only after we collect all the information and evaluate the situation.”
The Italian authorities are following the Juventa vessel, owned by Jugend Rettet, in October.
Its crew is suspected that the entire lifeboats were on the ship of migrants who were sent directly to it by human traders and allowed the smugglers to go along with the ships they could use again.
At least one such meeting was supposed to have been in a total of 1.3 miles from the Libyan border, as is confirmed in the allegations that had been published in Italian media.
The team is suspected of violating the requirements of the Italian coastal authorities that control rescue operations in this area rather than for any other reason.
The Code of Conduct assumes, primarily, that the juvenile court will have on board an Italian police officer who will monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs participating in the search and rescue operations agreed to sign the Code: "Save the Children", the Maltese MOAS and the Pro-Activa Dissemination of the Dissemination of Spain.
The last Thursday stated that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable provided that they did not draw any “significant changes or gaps” from its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign were the Nobel Prize for the Free Trade Organization (MSF).
Meanwhile, Miniti said that a sharp decrease in the number of migrants arriving in Italy during the past week as a result of rescue operations indicated that efforts to support Libyan coastal protection and cooperation with local mayors would bear fruit.
"In the last few days we have started to see the world at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with the Libyan mayor on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving the country in hopes of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we do not want to associate with one of the parties to the conflict."
In recent times, the RF authorities have significantly enhanced their policies in the Libyan direction, and with visits to Moscow, the delegation of the opposing Libyan parties has joined them.
The head of the Russian Contact Group on Intreliviary Resolution at the MD RF and Gosdume, Assistant to the Chief of the Czech Republic, Lev Dügov, told him what goals Moscow is pursuing in this region and who is making a contribution.
The contact group on Libya, which you are headed, is almost unknown.
That's what the contact group in Ukraine knows about her.
And here's the secret.
What are you particularly concerned about, and what are your goals?
The contact group was established on the initiative of the MDG and the State.
Its activities are fueled by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Michael Goddanov and Adam Dellimhanov (deputy Duma from Chechnye. "E").
The latter is authorized to work on the Libyan route of the Lord of the Blessed Lord.
The group was held in Libya by Russian tanker Mechanik Chebotarev (in September 2015 there were 11 persons on board).
We were wondering how to help the crew.
At that time, a contact group of military specialists, representatives of the Lord, was established, and our work was supported by the head of Chechny Ramsan Kadarov.
And how did you find out that you were the leader of her?
As I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have been invited to take the lead in the group.
Our activities have not been limited to the release of seafarers from Chebotareva.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all major groups opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - and on the side of Tripoli (which is based on the recognized United Nations Government in the head of Faise Saraj. - "E") and Tobruc (the residence of Parliament that opposes the Government and supports the march of Halifu Haftar, which controls the eastern regions of Libya.
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metiga (Livian Prime Minister "E"), we have been able to make a quick deal with the release of Russian sailors.
It was then decided to make more efficient use of these contacts, to establish a contact group.
Its task is to analyse the situation, identify key factors and toys, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to stress in particular: in Libya we do not want to associate with one of the parties to the conflict, we have dialogue with everyone.
How many people are in the contact group and how many are in Libya?
There are now five persons in the contact group.
Among them are persons with experience of work in the force structures, including in the Ministry of Defence.
We also wish to join a group of regional experts, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East RAN.
There are no staff in Libya all the time until there is no need.
There are now Russian military advisers, instructors in Libya.
And if so, on which side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All discussions and publications on this matter are not relevant.
But in your contact group, the former soldiers come in...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or they are closed to a certain time for us like Mishurata (where the training teams are based on the role of Libyan leader Muhammad Qaddafi in 2011 and have been significantly enhanced in the following years).
We arrived in Egypt in January of this year.
We were scared, they said that there were Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there, to analyze the actual military capacity that was responsible for why such hearings were going, what the role of Islamists did there.
In Egypt, we met with all the representatives of the teams involved in the destruction of IG in Sirte (in December 2016 this city on the Mediterranean coast was attacked by the fighters banned in Russia by the Islamic State " . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We wanted to look at them, get acquainted with these people, check the information that they had played a decisive role in the destruction of IG in Libya, not Halifa Haftar, who had signed those services.
And what conclusion have you come to?
The Islamic State in Libya won not Haftar?
That's not what he did.
Haftar had surgery on the other front in Benghazi.
And the IG in Sirte fought with the structures under which the Government was in Tripoli.
And, unfortunately, we have invited people in Russia to do this anti-terrorist operation.
They came to visit from 19 to 23 April of this year, and the Libyan delegation was invited to the Federation Council, Dume, Mide and Rosgvardia.
You, as we have seen, are in all the Libyan regions and you are probably introducing local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it is possible to implement the ceasefire agreements, the elections that took place at the end of July in Paris, Halifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj?
Or, once again, as it has happened several times in the past, will agreements be broken, war actions resumed, the parties will try to seize power alone?
For us, the fact that Sarage and Haftar agreed to a regular meeting has not been possible for so long.
In recent times, both leaders have been very negative about each other.
What about Russia's position...
They often write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe.
We were faced with this situation when they were in Misurat, and that is when Haftar was aboard the Russian plane Admiral Kuznez.
It was a coincidence.
But in Egypt, they did not believe in a coincidence.
They said, “You are probably very brave people who have come to us today.”
But our task is to show that we do not only support Huffar, we are conducting a dialogue with all the key participants in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar have been dating.
Does it make it easier for Russian human, emotional partners to understand the fact that he has been taught twice in the CSR?
And, Cstatti, does Haftar know Russian?
Russian if he knows it, it's very relevant.
But what he taught us is, of course, making dialogue with him easier.
And between the rest not only with him.
When we meet with soldiers in Tripoli and Missouri, we meet with the generals who have learned either in Russia or still in the Soviet Union.
And here's what they're talking about.
And they're going to go to Russia, some degree they're testing her fate.
Do you believe that the rapid abolition of the arms embargo against Libya is likely?
Are your Libyan allies interested in supplying Russian weapons?
They're interested, of course, but, as I said, we don't take sides in this conflict, and we don't want to put one another in harm's way.
We would like everyone to be in the same position.
With regard to the arms embargo, the Libyans were constantly calling for Russia to make it more effective.
Libya is now actively advancing the process of drafting the Constitution.
We hope that the parties will make compromise decisions and have an internal consensus.
Then there must be a choice as to what was said at the meeting of Saraj and Haftar.
If the elections are held and the legitimate authority is finally elected (and none of the parties currently have such status), the United Nations may be asked to remove the arms embargo.
It will only lead to the escalation of the conflict.
In the days of the media, it has been reported that Italy, facing the problem of refugees from Libya from Africa, feels compelled to pass EU Union law.
Could Moscow help Italian partners in this situation, using their contacts with the Libyans?
For example, how realistic is it that the Haftara branches will establish border control and put an end to the business of smugglers moving immigrants to Europe?
It's a very timely question.
We're working hard on this.
The Italians need Russia's support because Moscow is engaged in dialogue with Haftar, Saraj and Misurat and the South.
In this regard, the tribe of southern Libya plays a major role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it about crossing the flow of migrants on further approaches?
Is that what you're talking about, that's what the Nigerian migrants are doing back on the bus?
That's what we're doing.
But it's not just.
Some clans and groups are interested in continuing these flows.
We hope to help unite the South in the negotiating process between Sarajevo, Haftar and the southern tribes.
But for the first time, we would like to see the unity of views on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The head of the Government in Tripoli Faiz Saraj is considered a Muslim, a party to the entry into the country of Sharia.
How many radical views does he hold?
Would that not be an obstacle to the outworking of relations with Russia or the West?
I'll tell you my personal opinion about him.
In my view, he, on the other hand, is a sponsor of radical Islam.
But the Muslims are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself maintains that Libya must be an absolutely normal country -- a moderate Islamic, open-minded country.
He is also actively fighting terrorists.
Where's his reputation?
It has been established by those countries that are not interested in bringing Russia into contact with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, where there is a legislative, executive and judicial authority.
There are national oil corporations, national banks and other public structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in not going there.
And we mixed all the cards with them and started to interact actively with Tripoli and Tobruk.
We already know the results of this work: Rosneft concluded a cooperation agreement with the State oil company Livija-NOC.
Director of NOC Mustafa Santalla, with which the head of Rosnefti Igorh Sechin has concluded a deal, is directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first download of Libyan oil from Rosnefte went on.
What will Russia do with it?
I think I'm gonna sell it.
What about Russia's economic interests in Libya?
Plans to re-sign contracts concluded at Muammar Qadfi.
In particular, it concerns prior transport agreements (road construction), energy (electricification) and a number of others.
What about the Levites?
Well, they have oil.
Is that what it is, like, Iran, about the oil exchange scheme?
I don't know what the plan will be, I don't care about these matters right now.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main one.
We're actually doing peace work there.
Our main goal is to stop bloodshed, help the Libyans to agree on their own arrangements, and Libya has ceased to be a favourable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task of assisting the Libyan people and expeling terrorists from there.
Do you have data on the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical fighters from Russia or other countries of the former Soviet Union?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to clarify this.
I met with the representative of the Libyan Security Committee, who said that today there are no exits from Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union.
He said he had some 50,000 phone calls from the representatives of Islamic and radical groups (in Libya). "E" and the Russian word does not sound there.
And what countries are these combatants?
I don't want to get into this detail.
Then we'll figure it out differently.
How many of the fighting Islamists in Libya are the Libyans themselves?
The Libyans don't have them in practice, they don't have 5%.
The rest are coming.
Could Moscow conduct internal negotiations, such as Paris?
That's the plan.
We are conducting active negotiations with the Libyans, a number of delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow and have expressed their willingness to come to Moscow or Grozny yet.
And when can such negotiations take place?
Now it's hard to say.
A number of visits are still to be held, and I hope that there will be clarity about the time and place of the negotiations.
In the Czech Museum, charity workers collected money for the sick boy’s expensive gift
A nine-year-old boy, Sasha Macola, who has a DCP, a brain hydrocephalia and full of blindness, will be given a gift on 5 August.
A useful presentation is given by Saša, Minister of Culture of the Moscow area of Oksana Kosareva and the director of the Museum of Constantin Bobkov.
The coach's money was collected at the time of the charitable marathon "Don't Stop Doing Good" that went to Melikh on July 15th on the Day of the Memorial of Chekhov.
The discovery of a marathon in the museum was obtained by Sashi, who lives in the village of Manuskino Chekhov, who wrote: "I don't have any glasses, so I asked Mom to write this letter."
"I'd really like to get into the gift of a runaway road to make my legs strong, and I'd probably learn to walk."
And this is Sachin's dream!
After the dedication of the Concentrate-Postscript, a well-known pianist, a Russian artist, Alexander Gindin, will perform the promotions of popular classical works.
During the welcome marathon in Melichov, the host of the Voznesen David Desert, the master of Ili Drozzhin, students of the Moscow Conservatory named P.I. of the Czech and Russian Academy on the name of Gnesin, artists of the Melihoov Theatre of Chekhov.
For visitors, auctions were held, book brands were organized, and the sale of the sovenar product with a marathon logo was beneficial.
The Mélikovo Museum Advisor took the initiative to observe the Day of the Memorial of Chechnya on 15 July on the only day of charity in all the Museum of Podmosk.
A 30-year-old resident of the Olivsk Jitomir area near the local football stadium has been shot several times by the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was shocked by the noise, reported " Factam" in the GITOMIR Police Division.
After that, the man went into a coffee shop right away.
In the building, there was a conflict during which the man used the device to shoot the rifles, wounding one of the visitors.
A 34-year-old victim has received the necessary medical assistance, and his life is not at risk.
At the scene, police and early medical assistance were received, but the bullet was still broken.
The defenders established his identity and detained him on the same day, 2 August.
The man could not explain his actions.
It has a fire-fighting device that is sent to the experiment.
According to this fact, criminal proceedings have been initiated under section 296 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The detained person is in danger of losing his or her freedom for 3 to 7 years.
Remember, a shooting attack took place in Kiev, Luxembourg, on the street of Tatar, on the night of July 28.
Sentence by Michel Carter for reports of the suicide of Conrad Roy
The inhabitants of Massachuscets had been sentenced to two and a half years in prison because it, using text messages and telephone calls, had led to the suicide of her boyfriend, Conrad Roy.
Michel Carter, now 20 years old, will have to wait 15 months for the deadline and another 5 years for the test period.
Carter was recognized in June as guilty of the indiscriminate murder of Conrad Roy, which ended on 13 July 2014.
Father Roy said to the audience on Thursday: "My family was killed by a fire.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free to appeal.
She had spent a maximum period of 20 years, but her lawyers said that she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in a purple shirt and a creamy blouse, listened to the sentence, cut his hands, and let down his eyes.
"By her actions, she killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor's court.
"She stopped his life to improve her life.
She didn't recognize responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show any complaints."
But counsel Carter said it was a "tragical case she deeply regrets".
However, Judge Lawrence Monise said that her “age, age, or even mental illness did not significantly affect her actions”.
The prosecutor read the mother's statement by Roy Linn Roy, which says: "There has never been a day when I wouldn't cry for the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I am doing - I try to support his sister, despite all the pain that remains with us forever."
Sister Roy Camdin Roy said she was constantly following the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become his aunts.
"Let the man who was always with me from my very birth is the pain that will remain with me until the end of life," she said.
This case would appear to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that would provide for the Council to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was diagnosed with a fatal case of gas poisoning in his car, Carter was 17 years old.
The case drew attention to the whole country when it became known that he had been subjected to the suicide of Carter's mission.
"You can hang on, touch the cross, put the knife around me," she wrote in a few messages sent two weeks before he died when he was gone with his family.
A few minutes before her suicide, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad," and "You just have to include a beating, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monis said that Carter wanted to pay attention to Roy's death and prevented her from talking to the press so that she could not get what she wanted.
The views of the lawyers were divided in this regard.
One of the few who protected Carter was Amanda Nox, who was convicted in 2007 for murder in Italy by his British neighborhood and sentenced two years later.
The 30-year-old Nox published his special opinion in Los Angeles Times, which stated: "Mishel Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Eugenia Bogachev: "I left Langford as a bird of high flight."
One of the best basketballists in the U.S. U.B. League, 33-year-old Kit Langford, left UNIXs.
The U.S. Secretary-General ' s statement was made by President Eugenia Bogačev.
Kitt made this decision on family circumstances, Eugenia Bogachev told her.
He's got a little boy, a woman who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Kit wants to be closer to home.
I decided to meet him.
Of course, I could say "no" and extend the contract, but he deserved another relationship.
He played at UNESCO for three seasons and showed a high level in each parent, accounting for 100 per cent.
That's why I let him go as a bird of a high flight.
We thanked him.
We want him to succeed in family life and play career.
Kit Langford has been playing in the indicated club for three years. He's playing the series Edino Li-2015/16.
In the 2016/17 season he received a prize for the most successful game in the Eurolika season.
He picked 21.75 eyes in the middle of the match.
The result has been the second since 2004, when the prize has been established.
Langford, who also won the prize in 2014, became the second player in the history of Eurolika, who won this award once more.
In the near future, Langford will sign a contract with the Chinese "Schenching", informs Eurohops.
The United States is expected to conclude a two-year contract of $5 million.
Langford will become the second of July's Eurolika star, which will be transferred to the Chinese Championship.
Previously in the Chinese CBA, the X-Central Panatinicos was replaced by Jannis Burusis.
The sun-burned tourist from the South Pacific evacuated by a helicopter in Adigee
The Athenian rescuers today evacuated from the mountainous region of the sub-Muslim tourist, who received the most powerful sunglasses.
The man went back to the "Fisht", located at a height of 1.6 thousand feet.
The 27-year-old tourist has experienced increased pressure as well as difficulty breathing.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The rescuers were approached by a tour group leader who said that a man's wounds had gone.
Audi should be modified to 850 000 diesel cars
A day before the Audi announcement, BMW said that it would be proposed to upgrade software to more than 350 000 cars.
The president of BMW stated that the company considered that “there are more intelligent ways than driving restrictions” than the European city, including Munich, where “BMW” was available, which considered the possibility of prohibiting or restricting the use of diesel cars.
The Diemler said on Thursday that it would modify three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies called their step by the call.
European car manufacturers actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to facilitate compliance with carbon emissions rules.
But nitrogen oxides, which emit diesel engines, are considered concentrogens and can cause asthma.
The value of the installation of equipment that neutralises exhaust gases from diesel cars is also increased, and the competitive price for cars becomes difficult.
While German car manufacturers are under constant scrutiny, the Government of Angel Merkel's Chancellor has also charged that it is affecting car manufacturers and ignores the signs of the problem.
Companies are trying not to repeat the Folkswagen errors, which hindered the use of the so-called “degradation devices” that could transmit the amount of waste gases emitted during testing to comply with the rules and were excluded under normal driving conditions.
Several Folkswagen leaders were convicted in the United States, and the rest were prosecuted on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month in Germany, the former chief of the thermodynamics department was arrested in the Audi engine development group.
Former manager, Zacqueo Jovanni Pamio, an Italian, and therefore not protected from extradition and may appear before a U.S. court.
Earlier this year, Audi was under German criminal investigation with Folkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of setting up a system to deal with European emission rules and expanded the investigation that had previously been focused on the United States.
The Audi inclusion in the investigation may create serious problems for Folkswagen: the manufacturer of elite cars is a source of relatively large proportion of Folkswagen's income.
A coffee visitor in Australia paid for false money
The police received a notification from the bank's office staff on the transfer of funds received from the public sector with a suspicious coupon of 5,000 rubles.
A study carried out at the Expert-Criminalist Centre showed that it was false.
As reported by the Russian Federation of Australia, one of the visitors to the coffee shop was paid by the bank.
It is noted that the case was not equipped with the determination of the true identity of the buyer.
The police are currently establishing persons involved in the production and delivery of a separate CB RF ticket.
Such crimes are punishable by deprivation of liberty for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the MDG calls on the residents of the Australian area to be careful in the course of financial operations; it is recommended that business operators set up units to verify the validity of the funds received.
Astronomers have found a planet that can even swim in iron.
In the first study of the stratospheric properties of the giant spacecraft called WASP-121b, the astrology was little surprised by its temperature, which was able to emit iron and other metals.
Specialists pointed out that water molecules are so polluted by the light of the stars that they are exposed to infrared radiation.
The telescope Hubble has printed water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature allows water to shine in the atmosphere of the planet into the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "burning Jupiters" — gas giants, sizes and masses comparable to the largest planet of the solar system but located in a tens of times closer to the parent star.
This year, only 1.3 Earth days are spent on the surface, and its gas surface is nearly 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit [2,500 ° C].
Climate change threatens the Lavande in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and South France, but it is now threatened by climate change.
Lavanda has grown worse because of drought and infectious diseases; this has resulted in the permanent main pain of scientists and farmers trying to find a solution.
Eric Six, an expert from the CRIEPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, says: "Lavanda in Provence is indeed under threat, because in recent years this growth has been affected by climate change: heavy rain and especially drought.
This affects the life span of the lavender.
And there are still little cracks that attract the leaves that carry microbacteries; they become very dry in the cold weather."
There's a lot on the map.
Lavanda is not just attracting vacationers; lavana oil is very expensive in perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Six says: “In place of very long columns with a large number of large colors, we have small, undeterred, weakened or at all missing.
Therefore, we have fewer parts containing enamel oil."
The decisions that are now being considered include improving the distribution of water and the slowing of soil from soil, as well as depleting the plants of a protective mixture of soil and water and extracting more sustainable droughts.
Ambassador of the University of Winter 2019 met with the schoolmates
A two-time hockey World Championship, Ambassador of the Winter University, 2019 Alexander Semin met with threats from hockey beginners and distributed the autograph to patients.
The meeting was held in the summer of the winter University of 2019 within the thematic week on hockey.
Any visitor to the tent could walk on horses on the floor with an artificial lard.
In addition, estaffets, victors and games were organized with the destruction of the sovereign production of student games, a break from the federation of the aircraft.
50 students attended the event.
Alexander Semin told the children as much as possible about sports stadiums and stressed that the most important part at the initial stage of training was hard work and a desire for hockey.
"It's good that in Krasnoyarsk there's such a platform as the Winter University University 2019, where beginners can ask questions directly to team trainers," the champion said.
We note that promoting student sport and a healthy lifestyle among white people help the Ambassadors of the Winter University to 2019.
Shater University will work for the entire summer season until 25 September, reports the South University Press Service of 2019.
The Lord commented on Medvedeva's words
The official representative of the U.S. Department of Justice, Hizer Nauert, commenting on the briefing by Prime Minister RF Dmitria Medvedev, stated the need to find "authorities for interaction" with Russia.
It said that such areas should be found to “improve bilateral interaction”.
Nauart, for example, referred to the Syrian Peace Agreement for such successful cooperation.
We're two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other," the diplomat said.
Nauret refused to comment on Medved's approval of the full-value trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia said so, she certainly has the right to speak, but no more can I say anything on this subject," said the representative of the Lord.
Former US President Donald Tramp signed a draft legislation on sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new sanctions package, the head of the Government of RF Medvedev stated that Washington had declared a fully-fledged trade war in Moscow and had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also stated that the United States sanctions would operate for decades.
In addition, he considered the Prime Minister to be the U.S. Secretary of State to be a "clean game" of Trampa.
The missing one in the Podmoskobilder was found on the foreign side of the missing memory.
Bodibilder Shamil Hanmetov was on his way to Noginsk on 25 July under very difficult circumstances: he left the car room to go to the toilet.
Seven days he was badly searched by prominent and local residents.
And there was Shamil on the other side of the street in Rammens.
He's perfectly grown up in his toilet shop.
The Dagedan athlete could not explain what happened here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember what his name was, but the passport was missing.
The identification of the person has helped declare his disappearance.
The doctors who came out of Hanmeto had partially lost memory and brain injury, reports the newspaper Mash.
Maybe sportsmen are waiting for other surprises.
The criminals who attacked Shamila were probably already in his apartment, and the keys were stolen from him.
The oil revenues in July exceeded the forecast of 7.4 billion rubles
The actual revenues received by July 2017 exceeded the estimate of 7.4 billion rubs, reported by the Ministry of Finance of the IMF.
The increase, as explained by the Government, was mainly due to a higher exchange rate of United States dollars compared to the average monthly value of June used for evaluation, as well as to a higher actual amount of gas and exports of predicted levels of petroleum products.
"The disbursement of the federal budget from the monthly assessment corresponding to the Federal Budget Act 2017-2019 is estimated in August 2017 at +40.2 billion rubs." - Minfin reported.
Thus, the total amount for the purchase of foreign currency in the internal currency for the period from 7 August to 6 September 2017 is EUR 47.6 billion.
Accordingly, the daily purchase of foreign currency is equivalent to 2.07 billion rubs.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currency in Minfin Russia.
Each working day during that period, the CB will conclude the purchase of foreign currency in organised markets in Moscow's market at the same time during the trading day.
The acquired foreign currency will be calculated from the Federal Qualifications account in the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
Each week's staff in the Riodos newspaper usually meet on the media to discuss plans to expose the most recent violent crimes in the state of Sinaloa related to organized crime committed by criminals or ongoing war criminals.
But today, victims of their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They said they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed to be safer: to take children to the office in 2009, where they had already broken the grenade, or to leave their home.
Security experts wrote three words on the floor in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name the names for each column - evidence is not needed, suspicions and internal feelings will be sufficient.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who suspect that they are in possession of the Government or cartels, a whole list of refugees whose work in Mexico has become dangerous.
Violence is not a threat, and there are still more and more journalists in the country: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 times as President Enrico Pena Nitto took his post in December 2012; 589 people were killed after the attacks and threats were under federal protection; and this year, at least seven people were killed in seven countries.
Among the last is their publisher and inspiration, the inventor of Riodos, Javier Valdes Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdes wrote in one of his many books on violent drug-related crimes.
Its absence is very serious, although its presence is a large picture of Valdes, showing the middle palace, with the title “Justice” looking at the Riodos building; two reporters in 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing shoes on which his dress, face or business pants are painted.
The seminar lasts less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their general trauma, their nightmares, their nightmares, their paranoia.
Although the Office of the Special Federal Prosecutor for the Investigation of Journalist Cases was organized in 2010, only two cases were investigated, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
As in the case of most of the thousands of murders committed each year involving drugs and organized crime, journalists are rarely brought before the court.
Journalists of Riodos insist that they will write about violence in Sinaloa, even though they have been killed in the desert, even though it is now much more dangerous.
Without information about the killers, without the justice of the security talks at the meetings, Ibarra says.
"It's stupid to spend time on this seminar," he says.
"When we don't know why, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodos office in the capital city of Kuliacana.
He was able to walk just a few blocks before his beautiful Toyot the King left two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which means "The Twelve River".
The shooter went into his car and broke her apart.
Valdesu was 50 years old.
He's left with his wife and two grown children.
Listeners usually spend time on Kuliakana.
But about Valdes, it's almost silent.
Since Guzman was arrested and released in the United States last January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloodiest fighting fields in the country, as opposing factions are fighting to fill the educational vacuum.
We will not talk about killing one or more people every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the bathroom is filled with two - year - old drug dealers who are more than the homes of many living people.
We forget for a moment that the state of "peace" is just when one of the cartels takes control of the marine state with important ports and routes of drugs in the United States.
Despite this and that Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, 60-year-old novelist and director of Riodos, felt guilty that he could not protect another.
He thinks murder helped two mistakes.
First, an interview with Damaso Lopez was published in February, a leader of one of the opposing factions of the cartel fighting the children of Guzman.
The publication could upset the children; the people who were supposed to be members of the gang collected all copies of them as soon as they were delivered in Kyoto.
The second error was that he did not prevent Valdes from leaving the country because of his own security after another newspaper had been arrested, which he wrote about the same story.
Valdes was a legend in and beyond Mexico, and his murder was assessed as a direct link to the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been away from danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter in Norway and sold his 50-dollar shares in 2003 with five colleagues.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without affecting the subject of drugs," Bohorkes said.
In time, the newspaper earned the reputation of courageous and honest publishing, sales, and advertising of growth.
Journalists were pleased that they could publish bold reports, not with fear of censorship, but with the audience’s interest that they could read about what no one else had ever been able to write.
Eight years after its foundation, Riodos received a prestigious award from Mary Murs Cabo for the reporting work in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Prize for Courage to Investigate Drugs to Mexico, where it would tell us.
He openly admitted that he was afraid of him.
"I want to live further," he said to the CPJ award.
The drug dealer in Sinaloa, "that's a picture of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompevento TV.
"You must take the tasks that lie on you as a journalist - or so, or you're just playing the trick."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when you were around so much death... why didn't you tell me what's going on?"
The Riodoses staff beat down Valdez, a thief who ran like a freighter at the port, another, generous at the offer and advice, a teacher who knew how to get hundreds of lives.
They relied on what they had been ordered to do.
He should've always been wearing his shoes.
He had to go to El Guayabo, bar opposite the office, and always sit there for the same table.
Now they ask: Has he lost his love for a single order?
His death caused them to wonder in their own calculations how better to do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like when you get to know their wives, children, their legal business, and their semi-drugs.
"These things were too bad," said Bohorkes.
As a result, even in the best of times, self-assessment and self-sustainment were high.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from what's wrong.
The problem, says editor "Radose" Andres Willyreal, is that "a conspiracy can be false... and then what happened to Javier."
The old rules, he says and others, are no longer active in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a food shortage of profitable smugglers, weak public institutions and corrupt officials.
Landshawt keeps changing.
In the room where Riodos were gathered for security training, hundreds of telephones were banned: a few days ago it became known that Spanish programmes, which were sold exclusively to Governments, were used in Mexico for the follow-up to journalists and public activists.
Two police officers are trapped in the forest of 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius).
They were commissioned by the Government to protect the Riodos office, which is located in the four-heavy building in the Kuliuan district.
Some reporters asked whether those police officers did not include 50 per cent of the officers who had been told by the Governor himself that they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists were sent to a village where drug trafficking was under control.
The next issue of Riodos was addressed on three main topics.
It's the murder in Sinaloa's brother of the former boxing champion, Julio Caesar Chavez.
They still had government expenditures focused on the Governor ' s home city.
And there was a group of kidnappings in one of the most expensive restaurants in Kuliuana, in the district of the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when the time came to write what everyone in the city knew: that it was a favorite restaurant of drug dealers and authorities at the same time.
One of their journalists learned from the open database that the restaurant was registered on behalf of the ruling Institute for Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated all levels of authority over the past century.
In recent times, serious allegations of corruption have been made against several PRI Governors.
Vilieral asked journalists to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including when the son of El Chapo, Guzman, escaped from the arms race.
A few months ago, readers would ask Valdes for the most reliable information on the theft.
"We'd already know what happened before," says 46-year-old Willieral, for his own selfish body called El Flaco.
"Today all channels of communication with our sources are destroyed."
Cabinnet Valdes is now used as a warehouse for posters and strikers with protests against the murder of journalists, because staff have become the ones they never thought to be: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and sent the following morning to the local prosecutor's office.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michigan in the west of the country three days after Waldes was killed.
The body was found, and the authorities said it was based on DNA tests.
All over the country, journalists have become vocalists, organized protests, and written "SOS Press" on tractors and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington, trying to secure international support in the demand for justice in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the following day after the murder of Valdes Ramires, he accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering them to kill for what they were telling the truth.
She then asked that she not be given any further tasks to highlight the activities of the Government, fearing that anger would harm her objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "circulated" by organized crime, by its governmental partners and by a variety of societies.
In his last book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that the reporters were killing not just gangs of drug dealers; they did so by ordering policies and security services in the context of organized crime.
The Committee on the Protection of Press, Articulo 19, believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year have been carried out by police and government officials.
"You die in Mexico because they want to close you," Ramires says.
Of course, murder scares people.
They remember the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Massias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
On her body, she found a note, supposedly written by Zetas, "I'm here because of my articles".
The computer keyboard and monitors were lying next to her cut head.
Some publications prefer to close the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the death of its correspondent Miroslav Brich in March.
Others continue to be held as El Manyan from Nuevo Laredo after her leader was killed in 2004.
In 2010, Díario de Ciudad Hueres spoke publicly to drug dealers using an editorial article on the first page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their homeland or their country at all.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find a job, and they're still looking at the danger on the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as it appears, with a photo by Ruben Espinoz, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in the Mexico neighbourhood three months after the flight from Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work are balancing each day between risk-related decisions.
Ebarra, who used to dream of being a poet, admits that he was afraid to write about drugs.
"Mexican's falling into hell, and that's why I'm a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, when the last issue was ready to be printed, the publishers of Riodos sat on the truck next to the office and drank beer when their cell phone rang simultaneously.
A series of shootings between opposing gangs and security forces soon left the city of Masatlan after having left, according to confirmed data, 19 bodies.
The war continued to spread, as promised in the series of messages from maps discovered in the region.
Sitting on the street, they posted news on the Riodos website via the mobile phone.
The next day, the first page had to be given.
Soon the sirens were picked up -- another shot in the neighborhood.
Bohorques saw if they were ready to defend their police.
If they had been threatened, they would not have shown it.
Sitting under the massive portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle pallet had been exposed to the whole Sinaloa, the Riodos staff continued their work.
"How can you think of closing up?" said Bohorkes, "if the very day Javier was killed, the practitioners asked me to send her on the street to report?"
Dinosaver used a camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, he seemed to be a statue, even though it was a horrendous one.
The researchers said that the first found remains of an incredible substance were so well preserved that the experts called it "Money Liza among the dinosaurs".
It kept so well that they could even determine that the color of his skin was red and red – and to say that he had, in some way, “the dark past”.
In the report published in the journal Modern Biology, it was described as “the best preserved from Tireophor for all history of discovery and one of the best examples of dinosaurs in the world”.
This is a recently discovered sample of nodozavur, living in the middle of the dry period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredible good condition has been alarmed by researchers who call it “expertly remarkable”.
This fibrous tyreophorus is the most well preserved species in all history of finding, according to articles in National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Shawn Fanko when he worked at the millenium of Sankor near Fort McMurray in northern Albert, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He focused on what was said to be different from the environment and decided to look more closely at it.
Their discovery was sent to the Royal Palace of Tirrell.
Over the next six years, there was work to discover an animal in the ground with a mass of 2,500 pounds (1100 kg).
Now that all this hard work is done, the final result can be demonstrated.
“It is only easy to get excited, and you can practically believe that it is asleep,” told the lead author, Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tirrell Palace Museum, where the creation is demonstrated.
“It comes into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well-kept examples of dinosaurs – Mona Liza among dinosaurs.”
After studying his skin, the researchers found that it was harmful, although it was covered with a pancreas and reminded of a moving tank, apparently a significant danger was posed by flat tires.
This powerful dinosaur has been using a white camouflage to get rid of witches and has used a protective technique known as a protective class, which is also used by many animals of our day.
This would make it easier for him to deal with the environment and avoid encounters with enemies, experts say, assuming that larger dinosaurs were attracted to him.
This substance has been widely lit in May at 110 million years of age with regard to the Nodozavre family, and is now at exhibitions at the Royal Palace of Tirrell.
The students have already studied the animal and have given it the name Boreelopelta markmitchelli in honor of the museum labist Mark Mitchell, one of the members of the group who spent more than 7,000 hours behind his rupture.
The amazing survival of the sample enabled Dr. Mitchell and the international group of students to document the drawings and shape of the glass and pencils on his body.
They discovered a protective circle, a spreading method of protection in the kingdom of animals, which means that the top of the substance was darker than the lower part.
Although the protection class was well-exploited, the opening was unexpected, since the size of the Boreopelta diocese was significantly higher than the size of the now living animals with the protection class.
It can be assumed that the dinar was so actively driven by the platitude of the dinar that evolution preferred the masking of the confrontation as a way of survival.
However, most modern-day animals with a protected landscape, such as ovarians, ovaries, or bronchos, are much smaller and are more accessible, as evidenced by the fact that nodosavre has come to fight seriously for survival.
“The serious threat of hysterics to the massive, large-scale dinosaur pancreas shows how dangerous the hives of the Melo-period have been,” Brown told.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the dynasopharynx also indicates that its skin should have been reddened.
The students continue to study the animal, the same information about his life, including the contents of his food tract, in order to find out that he was asleep during his last encounter.
They think that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was put into the sea, where he fell and slept under the bed on the bottom of the ocean.
At the time, Albert was as hot as now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans, almost always, were spreading far deeper dry than now.
“This nodosever has indeed been noted for the complete coverage of the preserved skin and at the same time has remained entirely in three dimensions, maintaining a significant shape of the animal,” said Brown.
“As a result, the animal is now almost the same as it was then in the early honey period.
It is not necessary to draw the impression that it must be restored, that it is only a matter of urgency, and that it is practically believed that it is asleep.”
It was a period of time when giant terrorists, floating dinosaurs, standing on two legs, sailed on the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, Tiranosevre rex lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, one of his terrible ancestors could have been killed on the thireofor.
These include acrocantosever, a marvel of 38 feet (11.5 m) in six tons.
Students who have recently been published in the journal Modern Biology believe that Borealopetta was introduced into the sea after her death and mumified in it.
The substance was found by Shawn Fanc when it worked on the Millennium boat near Fort McMurray in northern Albert, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to the museum staff, it is the world's best-kept tyreophorus, along with the skin and the pancreas, and it is the goal, from the sea to the shores of the poor.
On average, these substances reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
Their mark was a two-tenth scarf from their shoulders.
The researchers believe that this trajectory was difficult to find that it is now Canada until the different river has brought it into the open sea.
However, the underground storage of the dinosaur has kept its pancreas in close proximity to the softer details.
The remains of this particular specimen have been so well preserved that the remains of the skin are still covered by the bursary pancreas around the dynasopharynx.
As Michael Greschko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, the level of conservation “is rare as a lottery win”.
The longer I look at him, the better he seems.
The remains of the skin are still covered by bursary pancreas covering the animal’s head.
His right front leg was pulled down to the side, five fingers on it turned up.
I can count the scales on his head."
Mihail Saakashvili was able to escape to Poland without documents
Michael Saakashvili, former head of Georgia, and then the Odets District of Ukraine, had arrived in Poland.
He did so without documents confirming his identity and nationality.
The arrival of Saakashvili is reported by the Polish publication Telewizja Republic, which posted a video on its YouTube channel with its statement.
Saakashvili spoke in honor of the Anniversary of Warsaw's revolt against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since he did not know Polish, although he was trying to speak that language, he had to speak English through the Polish translator.
In his speech, the issue of Georgia's cooperation with Poland was covered by politics, as was the case with Ukraine.
Ukraine ' s migration service has lost its citizenship, and the general policy has been known in the United States.
How he was able to carry out a transatlantic flight without documents until it was unknown.
The former governor of the Odès area, Michael Saakashvili, stated that his signature on the questionnaire for Ukrainian citizenship had been signed.
The politician emphasized that he had not filled any questionnaires.
The duration of the outcome of the Vanziher and Olkhovic case extended until January
The duration of the preliminary investigation by the owner of the Renov Group of Eugenia Olkhovica and the head of the T Plus Energoholding Group, Boris Weinziher, was extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Basman Court considered the extension of the alleged domestic arrest.
At the meeting, the representative of the COP informed the decision to extend the period of preliminary follow-up.
“The special complexity and duration of the investigation are due to the need for the removal and experimentation of a large number of documents, as well as the conduct of investigations in the territory of several RFS entities”, the investigator said.
He added that the suspects had regularly given the commission's leadership.
Their total size is estimated at at least a billion rubles.
As a result, Vanziher, Olkhovic, and former ZAO Director "Completive Energy Systems", Michael Slobodin, who led the company Vimpelko by 5 September, transferred to the top officials of the Republic to the Commission for the establishment of maximum fuel and electricity tariffs, as well as for the creation of favourable business conditions.
Winziher and Olkhovic were arrested, held in Styivkar and arrested for two months, and Slobodin was expelled from the trial and declared a federal investigation.
How did one activist know the answer to the question “What street?”
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrel was dragged to the depths of the soul.
It was only the day after arriving in New York during a tourist tour of St. Louis's church, that he was sitting in a room rented by Airbnb, watching a Facebook tape on the phone.
She ran into someone from high school.
It was said, "The police only killed a eighteen-year-old boy, and he's still in the middle of the street."
I took note that no more of her tapes had sent this information, which she had written, closed the Facebook and opened a Twitter store.
There was a lot of leftovers of user with nothing @TheePharoah.
Reper from the Great St. Louis, in real time, announced the death of Michael Brown, a non-armed 18-year-old, killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photo of the lifeless body of Brown in the middle of the street where it will be four hours.
"It's a diocese," thought Ferrel.
But death was nothing new to her and her circle.
She left the phone, and later at night she came back to tweets about that people were being gathered at Canfield Drive.
There were photos of the signal tape and shouts of people and people who claimed that he was the father of Brown, who cried with the words, "The police from Ferguson just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw direct transmission as the police officer stood before a group of demonstrators.
On another video, she said, "I'm gonna kill you all... animals."
"It's a non-standard situation," said Ferrell at the time.
“It is not a murder like the ones we used to and which we can call typical.
At that moment, I felt a feeling.
I was angry and cried.
She took a ticket on her return trip and flew home the next day.
On the 11th of the evening, she took her six - year - old daughter out of her father’s house and decided that they both would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrel and Ferguson over the next three years became the theme of the new documentary film “What Street?”, which will appear on screen on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protests, love and loss, strength and stability from the perspective of people living in the community and in the crowded streets, calling for answers.
While Ferrelle went to Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a flower and varnish under color, they recalled a talk that had said yesterday many times, “on the experiences of black people and their status”.
And she said, “Remember how I told you about the people’s ignorance, in which they used to believe?
We are now going to Ferguson because the police have killed an 80-year-old boy, and that was wrong."
"I couldn't take it," said Ferrel later.
"What's going on today is a culture of... what happened earlier.
She should know about it, see it and ask about it.
It should not only be well understood in activists and organizations but also understand the different levels of the experience of black people and their situation and what we must do to be free to be released.
Even if I can provide her with an environment in which she doesn't personally face apparent racism, she's nothing different than any other black girl.
I feel bad for her if I give her something."
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made their first stop at South Florissant Road, on the street of the police station, standing some kind of palace camp, while activists were waiting for reports of the failure of officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrel and his daughter joined the local entrepreneur who produced the package chain.
They collected packages and helped distribute them to protestors.
At least Ferrel has turned the form of a new type of activism.
“My assets changed completely after 9 August”, she said, noting that, as a student of the University of Missouri, St. Louis, she was the president of the Association of Health Students, representatives of national minorities, and was concerned with food injustice and ill-health among black communities.
"I didn't have an organizer's experience.
It's only come."
A few weeks later, Ferrel met Saba Folayan, one of his organizers.
Folayan said that she and her chief operator Lucas Alvarado-Ferer “just wanted to document” the events.
Ferrelle came to the question, "Do you want to document or try to find a story on which to play?"
This scepticism was practiced by many, often whites, who came into the community to benefit from its pain and stability.
As explained in a recent interview by Folayan, “We have heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are not at the centre of attention, and they want to do so differently.”
Folayan has already joined his organizer, Damon Davis, a local artist who is aware of his activity in the death penalty.
His participation stirred the sympathy for the project in Ferrel and six other local residents with whom the project team “What street?” had been in touch for the past year after Brown's murder.
"In this documentary no one speaks for us or with us, we are talking for ourselves," said Davis.
“It was the most important thing for me, how these people would be presented, because it was just as I would be presented myself.”
And although the project was not focused on Ferrell's experience, in an effort to show that the movement “is not about the leader of the rescuer, but about how the community is united”, Folayan said, it was the most open of the film participants.
As a result, the “What Street?” showed unexpected personal aspects of Ferrel’s life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrel, laughing about the first time she saw the ready product.
“But I understood that when you do this work and look at black people, there must be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrel's story once again discusses and emphasizes the role of black gay women in the broader context of the movement “The Life of Blacks is important”.
Two of the three drivers of the movement -- those who created the #BlackLivesMutter in social networks after the murder of the black youth of Trevon Martin in 2012 -- are counting on homosexuals.
“Black gay women in leadership support all this movement,” says Ferrel. “And all because we are always fighting on a few fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden."
Folayan agreed with this statement, noting that “the movement, in fact, is supported by black women and the majority of gay black women”.
Nevertheless, she insists that “it is not a case of positive discrimination”, and that Ferrel was not elected as a central character of the film because of its outstanding characteristics.
"She was the man who woke up this energy," she said.
“On the other hand, it is not a coincidence that it happened at first, because when”
You can feel her energy through the screen."
There have been no cinemas in Ferguson since then, but there are complex racial ties between the community and the police.
Ferrell will be two and a half years at the test time for the cover of the six during the demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of a place called the home simply “Bardak”.
She's still holding on to the thing she learned when she went out on the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support one another.
We will lose nothing but our bones."
Two Salvadoran footballers have been disqualified for the taste of American games
The footballists of Salvadoran society, Henry Romero and Darwin Seren, have received long-term disqualifications for sports behavior.
At the time of the fourth final match of the gold cube of the North American and Central American Football Confederates and the Caribbean Basin countries (CONCACAF) the Salvadorans gathered American players.
The first was the protector Henry Romero.
The Salvadoran tried the attacker, Josie Altidor, and then he broke his chest.
Then, when the U.S. defence officer Seren offered the coal in his painting area, U.S. protector Omar Gonzalez tried.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches, and Seren for six.
The meeting itself ended with an American victory with account 2:0, transmitted by Goal.com.
Similarity: Artist creates portraits using DNA Chelsea Manning
In the center of the room in Friedman, New York, people, white, black and brown, all look alike to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Hizer Dui-Harburg from the sacks of sheep and wool that Chelsea Manning sent to her.
Manning sent copies of Fort-Levenworth prison, where an ex-exploratory investigation lasted 35 years for a significant transfer of confidential diplomatic telegrams on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, covering 2 August, is called the "Agreement of Similarity".
This is the result of a two-year review between Dui Harburg, whose art combines technology, information and art, and Manning, a woman transsexual and prominent dissident, whose Barak Obama sentenced everything for three days to the end of his presidency.
Analyzing and using the DNA computer programme from Manning to create three-dimensional portraits of people who might have such a gene, Dui Harburg has created a deep, although difficult to detect, not only the plasticity of DNA, but also the subtlety of their interpretation and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, but also the concept of identity.
Manning, who was born named Bradley Edward, but from an early age, openly said that she was considered to be a woman, 20 episodes were sentenced in 2013, including six violations of the spying Act, computer fraud and rape.
Her photographs were not available in prison, so only one of her photographs was known: a sernic black-white self, on which Manning, in the platinum detachment of the money, evidently felt naked, sitting behind the wheel of the car; and she became involved with this photograph.
In 2015, Dui Harburg successfully completed its 2012 project “Visiting the Unknown”.
The artist has created portraits of unknown people with the help of the judicial dimensions of the curvatures and the gravitational edge, from which the DNA must be removed and pictures of how these people might look.
And then she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article," explained Duy Hogburg on a preliminary presentation of a new press release.
At the time, Chelsea was unable to visit and photograph, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to receive a photo of her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her prisoner in the museum became friends with the inscription and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote a book of the comic book "Shoil Canungo", which described how the future President would soften Chelsea's punishment and be able to visit the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning in a few days after the book was released into the world proved to be a pleasant surprise after seven years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is something deep and strong and that the exhibition is being opened right now, when Donald Trump declares war on people who disclose secret information in the Government, and finds new ways to survive on Twitter the enemy he is calling for to freeze.
When Dui Harburg was asked to do it all over time, she said that "it's absolutely nothing".
In an artist's statement on the gallery wall, the grand signature of Manning below (with the heart instead of the point "i" in its name) calls for the end of "automatic separation based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture".
On the other hand, its mitochondrial DNA, a long triangle from C, G and A.
In addition to 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist has been researched in science), Dui-Harburg hoped to show us how amazing it is that we are, in any case, on our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genes do not determine how much we are exposed to genetic data for interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dui-Harburg; her 2007 video "Land memories" is also presented here.
"The DNA can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories are here."
The last part of the exhibition in one room is the novel mentioned above in comics.
Manning in King-Conga style appeared on the U.S. Correctional Cassary building with a speaker in hand.
"If they kill your word, they will win."
"So don't ever shut up."
"This is the direct quote from the letter she wrote to me," says an artist who welcomes us from Philadelphia.
"I still have skin scars when I'm talking about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - as it was done in comics - but when she comes, she'll welcome the masks in the center of the room, her own genome simulators collected, by the crowd of protestors.
This is also done intentionally, as is the case with all exposure to heights (5-2, Manning growth), on which the karandas have been subjected to genetics.
"I would've let them out on the walls before, but now I wanted them to look like a bunch of people," says Dui-Harburg about portraits.
"I wanted them to be like a mass movement formed around Chelsea as a movement that stood for her release."
Professor of the North-West University and a staff member of the Oxford University sought the murder accused police
According to the police, there is a national team of professors of the North-West University and staff of the Oxford University, who are investigating as suspects of the fact that the population in Chicago has been exposed to the death penalty.
According to the Cook District Court protocols, Monday orders were issued for the detention of alleged murder without the right to be released under the custody of the forty-year-old Windham Latam and the 50-year-old Andrew Warren in connection with their alleged participation in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, 20-year-old Cornell Duranlo died after he had suffered numerous knee injuries.
The warning issued by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was found on 27 July.
The police called, they came into the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found a victim with several wounds on the body.
According to officials, Cornelius Duranlo was declared dead at the scene of the crime, and now the detectives are investigating the death of knife wounds, considering her murder, while the police are actively investigating two suspects.
Latam took the position of an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at North-West University since 2007.
Alan K. Cabbage, Vice-President of the University of Communications, reported in an e-mail statement that Latvia is in administrative leave and that it is prohibited to enter the North-West University campus.
“It is now a criminal case investigated by competent persons, and the North-West University is cooperating with the consequences”, said Kabbaj.
Warren is a senior financial officer at Oxford University.
The representative of the University and Somerville College reported in an e-mail statement: “We have been in contact with the United States police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the United States investigative authorities”.
The statement also stated that colleagues of Warren were shocked and wanted him to leave.
Chief of Police Affairs of Chicago, Anthony Gullemi, said that he was highly advised by the suspected authorities.
“The police have assumptions about their location, but our efforts to find them are being strengthened,” said Gulelimi.
According to Guillem, local, regional and federal authorities are assisting in the search for suspects.
According to Gullemi, the police called the Grand Plaza building administrator, who had just received a secret report that something happened in 1008.
The police called the crime a terrible place.
The Players reported that it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th.
According to him, video camera data confirm that Latam and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that the professor of Latvia and the victim were related to the relationship,” said Gulelimi.
The Grand Plaza Guide addressed the situation in which it was reported: “The police are currently working on the history of the incident, collecting information on the victim and examining a number of reasons, including possible domestic incidents”.
Russian Prime Minister Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of the road map of VADA in the near future"
The Russian Vice-President, Vitaly Mutko, said that the conditions of the World Anti-Dumping Agency (WADA) for the renewal of the work of the Russian Anti-Dumping Agency (RUSADA) would be met in the near future.
"A certain step has been taken to meet the requirements, and RUSSAD has the right to plan and carry out tests in conjunction with UKAD (the anti-dumping agency of Britain).
The WADA road map was updated accordingly," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map on the restoration of the status of the Code of Conformity, which lists the conditions for the renewal of the work of RUSSAD and has recently been published on the website of the organization.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could present difficulties for Russia.
"All has been declared, everything will be fulfilled.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IMO) and WADA in the near future.”
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that the Russian Andiping Structures should publicly acknowledge the results of the Canadian lawyer Richard Maclaren's investigation under the WADA, which claimed that doping in Russian sport was controlled by the State.
In this regard, Mutko said: "We know the investigation because our anti-dumping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there was no host program, and we won't recognize what wasn't."
Mutko repeated the words of Vitalia Smirnova, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Dumping Commission.
On the same day in the Russian edition of "Rsport" Simrinov recognized previous problems in the Russian anti-dumping structures, but he added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain positions and conditions.
No one will ever accept this report," Simirnov added.
WADA removed RUSSADA from doping control in November 2015 after the doping scandal.
However, in June this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate the testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Dumping Agency (UKAD).
Following the visit of the Moscow office of the organization in July, Director-General of VADA Olive Niggli stated that RUSSADA “is moving in the right direction” to restore its work.
Fire extinguished at the 79th floor in Dubai
A huge fire that occurred in one of the tallest buildings in the world, The Torch, a towered tower, transmits Reuters.
It is noted that the fire has been able to cope with all fires up to 4.00 per local time (3.00 ms).
The local authorities reported that no one had suffered as a result of the incident.
At the time of the fires, the roofs of the street were covered.
The causes of the incident are still unknown.
It was previously reported that in Dubai, the 79th floor skyscraper, the tower, was one of the highest buildings in the world.
All the houses were temporarily evacuated.
An Inexhaustible House of Worship: Uncovered Whales
The scandalous Dom-2 show led by Olga Buzova defeated the viewers of the Europe Plus Live festival with dancing.
In the eyes of thousands of worshipers, a renewed song with Nasty Kudri was filled with the song "It's gonna burn".
Both girls went to the stage in the provocational "blokes" so that there was a lower white bead.
The records of Buzova and Kudry were made on the bridge.
Previously, it was reported that the changes in Buz's appearance had been commented by a specialist in Moscow's plastic surgery clinic.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
On Friday, 4 August, the Radio 4 news service reported on foreign media.
He said that the Russian authorities were responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
At the CNN, NATO's gender also criticised Russia for the situation with Crime and for "destabilization in eastern Ukraine".
At the same time, Stoltenberg believed that dialogue with Russia, however, would be possible, and the further esulation of the situation would not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier in the fourth U.S. President Donald Tramp stated that relations between the United States and Russia were at a dangerous low level and accused the United States Congress.
Metro Ekaterinburg boasts a new method of payment
In October, travel to the Ekaterinburg Metropolitan would be possible to pay for a bank card, OAO Director Paul Vedernikov said in an interview with the Public Journal.
Our goal is to introduce the 2018 Football World Championship to the same system of travel in the subway as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, New York and Novosibirsk.
"We want sick people from other countries, guests of the Mundial, to be able to use metropolitane with their bank cards, without acquiring taxophones and not standing around," he said.
Starts that will help your company not become a regular choice
Amy Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among its e-commerce staff, but the surveys had not worked.
The answers were often ineffective, useless, or worse, inconceivable.
Even though she promised anonymity, some staff members did not trust the process.
“It has never been consistent and objective,” said Errett, managing 75 people in San Francisco from Madison Reed, who is engaged in electronic hair care trade.
As a result, she turned to the third person for help.
A new type of start-up in the field of staff is now being developed, which helps companies to understand how their staff are feeling.
By developing and licensing the software for which the staff have been assigned to measure their involvement, they allow companies to express their requests, to call on certain teams and demographic groups, to offer anonymity and fire-fighting personnel for complaints, and in some cases to enable the informants to pass the cluster and address directly.
“Now we have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Barnett, the founder and president of the Glint-based Redwood City, whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure staff involvement.
Errett told her that she had gained a greater understanding of what her staff were thinking and feeling for three years using Glint.
In addition to the requests and questionnaires of certain team members, the product offers a warm map of the company and shows in a prudent manner which entities are more concerned and which low approval rating managers allow it to understand why.
At the very least, companies realize that they need to monitor the situation at the workplace, otherwise they will become a regular "Uber", which was placed in a scandal when an ex-employer posted a post in a blog describing the aggressive situation in which those who expressed their displeasure were punished.
For starters such as Glint, this desire to control the situation is an opportunity for profitable business.
Based on the evaluation of the Internet portal, “Let us talk about pay” on financial technologies, the global governance, regulation and compliance industry could amount to over $118.7 billion by 2020.
Conversent's launch from Geneva, Colorado, helped companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a small increase in interest and activity earlier this year on the basis of Ubera's reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently appeared among clients.
Like Glint, Convercent, allows companies to send individual staff reviews, collect confidential responses in real-time mode and watch hot maps in the challenging areas.
It also provides a hot line for anonymous text messages that allows staff to report misconduct.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints will go directly to the address.
“The Court of Public Opinion has taken over the authority of inspectors”, said Patrick Queenlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it is found that the company is dealing badly with employees or acting in an ethical manner, even if the inspector is not involved, the company may be confronted with the costly consequences of the client-side, staff-related and judicial investigations, Queensland has reported.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants where over 25,000 employees work in 500 establishments, has used Convercent over a year to make sure that staff are in the course of rules and procedures, and to offer a simple way to go to the company's headquarters.
Earlier, if the staff member wanted to report the problem, he or she had to search for a telephone number or an office e-mail, file an official complaint, and hope that she would be treated seriously.
It was often a frightening and non-violent experience reported by James Vitrano, head of the Ruby Tuesday legal administration, who said that it was not a normal way to track the complaints of staff.
Now, when a company is used by the Convercent service, problems that were previously addressed by managers who sit in offices in other cities or states, such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages, can be detected and dealt with as quickly as possible.
“I can approach the full, comprehensive understanding of the situation of staff”, said Vitrano, who is head of the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
“And we protect our shareholders from court proceedings with staff.”
According to Quinland, companies began to deal more closely with ethics, values and involvement of staff in 2002, after Arthur Andersen's accounting firm suffered damage due to ethical violations resulting from Dela Enron.
But only when “social networks have received mass distribution” did companies realize that they would not be able to keep their green white from viral spread into the network.
“Before we started using technology to control ethical people, we used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service by making regular payments to companies for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity to approve venture investors who supported both sides.
In February, Convercent received funding of $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, resulting in a total of $47 million.
Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November, resulting in a total company capital of $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising if they take into account the interrelated nature of companies, cultures and venture capital.
A growing number of studies show that staff today expect more from their jobs than ever before.
In markets with intense competition, such as the Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, this is just the minimum necessary.
Staff members want to feel accepted and valued and to devote their time to a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in a company, they feel that they are listening to them and that the work they are doing brings results, they are more likely to make such a company successful,” says Nina McCain, Vice-President for Global Benefit and Satisfaction in LinkedIn, where Convertent and Glint are used.
Investors get income when business in their portfolio is good; business in the company is good when employees are given and taken in.
If third-party analytical instruments promise to increase the dedication and involvement of staff, it is no wonder that they are supported.
It is important to have data on staff involvement, as the cultural experts in the workplace claim.
But the data is useless until the company's sponsors take action.
In fact, if the company requests staff for feedback, it can create an impression that changes are needed.
And if the changes do not occur sufficiently fast or they do not occur at all, disappointment may develop, and staff members lose interest.
“If you are going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you must be prepared to make 4,000 budgets,” said Russell Ratt, president of the Advisory Company Kotter International, who had to see how companies made a mistake, relying too much on data collection.
If you do not come to the end, the followers will say, "Have you listened to me?
Aren't you all the same?
And if you're equal, why don't I be equal?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who is currently conducting monthly staff surveys, is able to take action on the same day when someone reports the problem with Glint.
And after withdrawing from staff members, insufficient decision-making and communication quality, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to train communication to solve the problems.
Ruby Tuesday receives new knowledge about its staff and hopes that in the long term these will help her to keep staff in the industry well-known.
"If you do not try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
If you lose people, you lose clients.
And if you lose clients, you lose companies.
New Asphalt for the Kressoarmey
In Barnaule, cardinal measures were taken to address the causes of Asphalt in the Middle East.
It's a place where we're twice on a recently-fledged passageway (the intersection with the Youth Street), it's decided to "get up".
Remember, the destruction of a small part of the road near the tramway was due to the passage of land into an unexploded network.
According to the Vice-President of the City Committee on Road Economy, Welfare, Transport and Communication Ivan Garmat, a detailed survey will be conducted for the detailed investigation and elimination of prejudices.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected that the ignition of wireless communications and their concreteization will need to be restored.
This is reported on the official website of the Foreign Office.
Command Bruns is due to the fact that the National Student Sports Association has ceased training twice a day.
The time is close to eleven o'clock; the football team at the University of California, Los Angeles, is being held to beat up on the one hand of the new training fields of the camp team.
Some of them had to stand up to their feet, slammed their backs after the first urgent day of the sports camp.
For many players, these minutes are endless in the middle of the day.
The games recorded for summer work, after three-hour training, will be run back to the community to prepare for the final exams, and the following morning they will return to the football centre of Vasserman at the meeting at 6:30 p.m.
Shortly before Monday turned Tuesday, the coach of the team, Bruns Jim Mora, said: “These kids are waiting for lunch for the next three days.”
The fact that the National Student Sports Association has stopped training twice a day, which was intended to reduce the burden on toys, has in fact reduced their working days, at least until Friday's exams.
Therefore, the first three training sessions of the California University team in Los Angeles were scheduled to be held at 7:15 p.m. to take place in and out of the level schedule of the games.
As a result of the lack of two training days a day, the number of days with one training was increased, and Brunss was moving into the camp nearly a week compared to last year's, and training was conducted during summer school for the first time in six months of Mori in Vesida.
According to the schedule, 18 trainings should be carried out by 20 August, including before formal training is started for the first game in the season against the team of the University of Texas A&M in September.
It had been said that it was supporting the amendment of the rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that another paragraph had appeared because of it in the game schedule.
"For three or four days we will give them this huge load, this is a serious test," said Mora.
"And they have no knowledge of it; they are only doing it, and they are the boasters.
I think that when we live until Saturday and we have more time, that will be really healthy."
At the end of the camp, the California University of Los Angeles is training closed; this is a difficult task, as its field is directly visible with a suitable parking lot and from the nearby Laskin Centre, a expensive hotel that has already been bombed by football bullets that have crossed the protective network.
Games from Brunsey should start with these exits, but Mora admits that when the rooms are free during the season, the problem may arise.
“We will be protected”, said Mora.
“This is a serious problem, and I do not overestimate the risk, assuming that someone can remove the room, sit there and record the training on the video.
If you have video training, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there and security on the parking lot number 8.
We do everything we can with what we have.
I'm not going to survive too much for that.
We have a plan."
All those who suffered from the trauma in Petersburg were taken out of the hospital
All those who suffered during the earthquake in St. Petersburg Metro in April were released from the hospital.
This was reported to the press office of Deputy Governor Anna Mitiani.
According to data at the end of July, three people were left in the station.
Remember, the explosion in St. Petersburg was on 3 April of the current year.
The bomb was shot by a terrorist killer Akbarzón Jalilov.
As a result of the earthquake, 15 people were killed, as well as the executioner himself.
In criminal case, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer, Abrar Azimov, were arrested.
Remember, the encouragement of the Rosso-Usor recommended that the Metropolitan Peterburg review the road safety plan, in particular by increasing the number of metallics.
Facebook enhances fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook will be more likely to send texts that are suspicious of mysticism, independent experts, and show their conclusions under the original posts, the fourth largest social network of the world, which is trying to combat so-called fictional news.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to identify possible misunderstandings, send them to check and possibly show the results of the actual wait under the original post.
Facebook has been critical as one of the main ways of spreading so-called fictional news, which, many believe, has influenced the 2016 presidential election in the United States.
The issue is also actively debated in Europe after French voters have been misled by false messages before the presidential elections in May, and in Germany before the September elections they have declared support for the plan to punish social networks if they do not immediately remove malicious posts.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook reported on the testing of a new fact-checking algorithm, which was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing what communications are contradicted by independent verifiers, people want to have a broader context in order to give reasonable judgements about what they are reading and what they are doing," wrote Sarah Sie, the Facebook news network manager in her blog.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the function of “related articles” and work on other changes in the news sheet to address the issue of fake news.
Create a Roman-Committee: One Close to English History
In the past, Scottney's short lock was taken off in the music video Squeeze, and in the 1970s and 1980s he served as a port for Margaret Tetcher.
But 700 years after his escape in the Bay Valley, Kent, he watched the turbulent history of the area, and now he inspired Jamie Rhodes, a cosmopolitan, and with devotion to historical documents, to Roman comics.
"I think it's so beautiful - to look at the face of a man who died 300 years ago," he says excitedly.
"You feel it so personal when you keep this letter in your hand."
The "Birth in England" covers the period from the mid-century to the Evardian era and tells about families living in Scotland; each story was illustrated by one of the young British artists — Eizek Lenkevic, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Grinberg.
This is not the first book of Rhodes, based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote a collection of articles of the British Library's documents.
"I could just print a finger at the end of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working on jakobs," he says.
"It's a print of his finger."
And the letters are always spread by the demon, because at that time the fires were burning.
And after 300 years, in the future, you seem to be there too.
Oh, how I love archives!"
For a person covered by such passion for old books to receive support from the National Fund and the British Art Council and to stay in prison for four months (“I’m telling the truth, I’m a little bit tired”), it’s too good to be true.
For the rest of the day, Rods studied the "new" Victorian castle, went through archives, and looked at numerous treasure and old things - for example, the caverns on walls or bottles that had been in the cave for centuries.
He went to the park and to the ruins of the old castle, talked to the easers, the gardeners, and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations in his book.
Then at night he "swallowed the whiskeys and sat down to write."
The history of Scotland's castle has not been studied very much, since the National Fund had received full access to it only in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassi, died.
When Rods arrived ten years later, the staff only began to understand the archive he described as “the aristocracy’s fall on the rocks for centuries”.
Journals, letters from the British Empire, maps showing who the authorities were: "You think the earth's disputes are boring," says Rods, but there were two families behind this market.
That's right, kids!"
In some of the history of the castle collection, there is a starting point for more research in English history: for example, in the Robotnike, the hero is only a castle built to join the Crestian Revolution of 1381.
"There is information about the rebellion that took place in the castle in 1380 in the book "Kenta and Sassex's Ricars", says Rods.
"The Cristian resurrection began in these places, and I thought that the rebellion was the proper beginning.
Maybe they were connected?"
Other ingredients are closely related to the history of the castle, such as the "Sacrifice" in which the priest-escist, whose family Darrell had spent seven years in the time of the English Reformation, was mentioned.
Or "Contrabandist" about 18th-century opponent Arthur Darrell, who, as they say, invented his own burials, struck the grave with stones (it was discovered several years after the tomb was dug).
Darrell, a beloved family of Rhodes, of all those who lived in Scotland, said: "Jentlmen seem to have been a perfect Jew, went into debt forever and spent money on things they couldn't afford.
In various generations, Darrell men have solved their debt problems, married to wealthy older women, and I represent them as a company of sympathic men who are capable of exploiting large-scale heirs."
After the closure of the work in Rhodes, he sought other opportunities to acquire a unique writing experience.
He spent two weeks in a Finnish audience, where he wrote a graphic novel about Yemen, a place where at the beginning of the 20th century was a sitter, and then it was rediscovered with forest.
But Scotland remains a special place for him.
"I had a hard time leaving," he says.
"I've felt like this: I've got to get back to real life."
Fifty-five major banks choose Russia.
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: seven other credit organizations are to be left behind by Sberbank, WTB, WTB-24, Alpha-bank, Gazprombank, Rosselhozbank, Binbank and FC.
Thus, at least 80 per cent of the market will be available for those who have left the ARB.
But this is not just an exit - all banks that have declared a break with the ARB - are negotiating with another public organization that combines credit institutions - the Association of the Regional Banks of Russia, which is headed by a known policy of Anatalo Aksakov, the President of the Committee of the Gosduma on the Financial Market, recognised, became, at the end of the last session and the most effective head of the thought committee and the delegation on the number of drafts.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was at the time of discussion in the Federal Council when new legislation was reviewed at the Interregional Banking Council, in particular by the new classification of banks depending on the size of the capital.
At that time, Mr. Garegin Tosunyan, President of the ARB, stated that, in the view of the association, this bill was adopted in the interest of major banks, which were thus seeking to limit the possibility of small and medium-sized banks in the regions, overcrowding their clients.
Among other claims was the criticism of the Central Bank, which, in the opinion of Tosunana, did not always justify the withdrawal of licences in some banks, which, in fact, followed the opposition by the representative of the CB: many leaders of the protracted banks, in particular the External Bank, were members of the governing bodies of the ARB.
We see that this exchange of views, inter alia, is very sensitive to the main banking regulator and has become an obvious reason for the five major banks to disagree with the ARB policy, to start preparing to join the Russian Association, noting that "the effectiveness of the work of the ARB is low and that the constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually being conducted".
Tabulators will be better
What's going to happen?
We are quick to respond to the main issue that arises in or around the small or conflict in or with the banking sector: contributors will not be afraid of, rather, the reverse will increase the confidence of the banking system.
Its title is "Rossia" Anatoly Aksakov, well-known in all the interests of banks and their clients, high-level professionals in the Central Bank: virtually all the leadership of the CB is in the annual activities of the association, and all the important legislative initiatives of the regulator are carried out through expert "regional" assessments.
It is clear that there are no special concerns in the framework of the organization plan.
As a matter of fact, the ARB falls into a difficult financial and administrative situation after the loss of such strong and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying capabilities.
However, in 1991 there was little potential for the organization of the banking community to continue to improve banking law and the scope of financial and credit treatment in general.
It cannot be said that, even in the Russians' association with the dispersion of new members, the judge, in response to her manager, Anatolia Aksakov (“maybe, too much envy”), who, on 21 July at Brifing in the Press Center of Parliament, said that “probably the next day representatives of the ARB banks had asked me to examine the potential of our association, Russia”.
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council and to give greater attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiating process is now under way, the proposals of both parties are being examined, the agenda is being prepared for an extraordinary meeting of the association to be held in Socia in mid-September within the framework of the International Banking Forum.
There we go.
Anatoly Aksak also stressed that “no cross will be held” called the possible new director of the updated association “Russia” Georgia Luntów, who left the post of Vice-President of the Central Bank in September, highly characterized by its business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatoly Aksakov, who is now breathing in Crimea, plans to stop and arrive in Moscow for one day at an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Association of Russia, where it is intended to consider the agenda of the extraordinary meeting of Russia.
The entry of a gas engine into the big cities of Russia will not be limited
The deputy head of Mintrans Nicolai Assaul stated that, despite media reports, the entry of a gas engine into the big cities of Russia would not be limited until it was reported.
It's a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept must gradually increase the environmental class.
And there's the concept of going to zero.
I don't think we're technically ready for this.
The question is, how long has it been?
That's the same thing as the losing phrase level-- let's stop it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
The whole city is closed?
"In 20 years, I don't know, maybe this will happen," says Prime Minister.
The previous newspaper reported that, on 17 August, the Vice-President of the Arkady Dvorković had been commissioned to study the proposals for possible options for the support of electric transport submitted to the Government by PAO Director Camaz Sergeim Koggin.
Among the proposals, on paper information, is the use of DVS machines in major cities and on the streets.
Washington's changing the rules for receiving the gincards.
As reported by the media, President Donald Tramp stated that a new US immigration plan would be adopted, which would change the rules for receiving the certificate.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants up to 50,000 per year, more stringent rules for receiving temporary labour visas and restrictions on receiving family visas.
New rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in two Congress Chambers.
“This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will result in changes in the distribution of U.S. border cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce the total migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new process of submission of applications will benefit English-speaking candidates with financial resources that enable them to maintain themselves and possess skills that will benefit our economy.” Trump, according to the American media, said.
The appearance of sex robots is real, and that should worry us.
We have failed to think that 2017 can no longer be worse than a new report on technological progress in the production of sex robots.
Mm-hmm.
Sex jobs are now at the center of attention.
The Fund for Responsible Technology (FRR) recently issued a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
In the view of Noel Sharki, a professor of engineering and artistic intelligence at the University of Cheffield and the FRR, we must refer to their appearance as a whole.
Users can choose the color of the work eye, the shape of the juice, and the type of leg.
"People are thinking about it, but companies are already sending their consumers a lot, and we will soon see them much more," Sharki said at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex offenders have evolved from their jealous colleagues in works with silicone skin, heat on the skin, and almost human responses to artificial intelligence.
Users can also "fix" their jobs to their taste by selecting all from the colour of the eye and the shape of the fruit of the work to the shape and color of the legs.
But the fact that many jobs have a “number” compared to which St.ford's wife would be very progressive is even more concerned.
Modern sex-cookers have turned into work with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix robot allows users to put in the robots the qualities they find attractive, such as stopperity.
There are yet more sex-worked Roxxxy Gold, developed by True Company, which is already programmed, such as the Gold Fair, produces a permanent impression, and Dicky Wendy has a bold character.
"The Roxxxy Gold has a character that suits you very well," reports the True Company website.
So she loves what you love, doesn't like what you don't love, and so on.
She's changing her mood during the day like this man!
She may want to sleep or hurt, or she may be "in the mood!"
The appearance of sex robots is a source of concern, not least because they are replacing real human relationships, but most of all, it is concerned about the undermining image of women, associations with rape, which are causing the possession of the Cold (read: against) Fara.
The True Company Roxxxy website compares to the elector, only for men.
"If women (sic!) can be an elector, why can't men have Roxxxy?" says the website.
But these sex jobs are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and their increasing complexity indicate something deeper and deeper in our culture, a departure from the idea of gender equality in the face of sexual desire, as an optional addition.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and although FRR notes their growing popularity, they are still on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very scientific about the meaningful times in which we live.
And many people are not stupid and aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
This is not a coincidence that these complex sexual acts occurred when women's rights throughout the world were threatened when there was a president in the White House, who praised what was happening to women.
The most terrible of all in the Service's television series is not graphic images, body-circuits and amazing eyes, that is, how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an increase, but it does not seem so much now.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to get this physical image to real women (only with porn stars), which technology allows.
Their designers want them to tell people how to copy the movement of the human body.
But their "natural" work is not like these women.
They can't argue with their partners or leave them.
They have no life or biography -- nothing that could indicate independence or something else that could destroy the illusion of full independence.
In other words, it's beautiful rubies.
Or, as they say in 2017, officers.
L.A. Yujin (Puh) Jetter, a member of the Ukraine Assembly in 2013, will not help our national team at the European basketball champion, whose final part begins on 31 August.
In the interview at the BeBasket portal, the General Manager of Sine-Water, Andrey Lebedev, informed.
We tried to negotiate with Jether, but unfortunately he would not come under family circumstances.
We're going to Eurobasket without a naturalized game, because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will allow for the development of our young players," he said.
Recall: With the direct participation of Jetera, Ukraine's collective took the sixth place in the Eurobesket 2013 and the first fire on the world basketball champion, where the "jeltto-shine" could not exceed the group stage, while the U.S. champion picked 15.4 shots, made 3 and gave 5 transfers.
Jetter stopped speaking at the gathering of Ukraine from the position of chief trainer of our national team, Mike Fratello, who left this post in 2015.
Eurobasket-2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will carry out its team tournament matches on the Promised Land.
The Consequences of the Virgin Islands will have five units in Group B: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for the tournament, our male congregation conducted two control units, in which Dutch and Belarusian people were allowed to attend.
A big trick of tramp?
I think Mita Romni is very reasonable.
In the era of Trampa, the fact that the political conflicts of the American power plant have broken down some families into micronutrition.
In the middle of the day of thanksgiving and birth, U.S. newspapers have been bombarded with columns about how to deal with terrible relatives voting for Trampa.
Looks like we're all so excited that we're going to be hit.
They're talking less about trampa's ability to unite the family.
I'm writing about this because my cousin, left-wing poetry from Chicago, who had been with the Republicans in my family for a long time, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that association in combating the common enemy could have a powerful effect.
At Trumpe in the White House, everyone she knew, including her brother-in-law, who had been arguing about politics for decades, was suddenly and strangely on the one hand.
Of course, this is good; but I cannot think that in a broader context it may be dangerous enough.
The tramp has inspired power in the left wing, but the deforming effect of his rule can cause us all to move right.
When we talk about tramp and normalization, we have a small chance that sometimes we will stop expressing its outputs.
There is, however, a more skeptical scenario, in which the Treaty "normalizes" the right of the Republicans, which, on the basis of its standards, will suddenly be shown as a healthy model.
I realized that I am very disappointed today about the old-fashioned myth of Mitta Romni, with a dog on the roof of a machine and a 14-percent incoming tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked) - compared to the Trip and that, and the other seems to be a very small evil.
When the tramp goes, the next Republican candidate will simply be in his mind to see a great step forward.
When my kitchen went to the center, we went with the kids on a wheelchair in the Central Park, the biggest wheelchair in the Department of Parks in New York and the best way to spend three dollars in the city if you don't need coffee.
The evils are terrible and huge, images from the glassboard on the central drums are criminal clones and animals who, in awe, look at themselves on the back, are extremely violent, and strange music as it is.
So many famous things in this city are disappointing: the skyscrapers are getting old, the buildings are too busy to challenge, and the city's reality does not succeed in a dream.
Thirty-five years ago, and I still survive the day when I learned that the Suiss Cottage area is actually not Switzerland's chess.
And the Corusel in the Central Park is still an unusual, unusual place where two-year-olds, eleven-year-olds and two-year-olds can spend a great deal of time.
If I could put the carrots, I'd put the five, but fortunately, no one asked me about it.
And at the university this week, I was asked to carry out a terminal card, to assess my "petch" purchase on a scale from one to five stars.
In coffee on the corner of my street, the same option is to follow the price of tea in 15 percent, that's for the order at the stop.
As a result, not only is neutral in the idea of interaction but there is still a need to make a personal relationship in a situation that is not expected of it.
The poor salesman in the universe was so impressed that I was able to evaluate my experience of giving her a credit card in five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital because of pain in the chest
Pistorius is leaving prison because of his visit to the doctor for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for treatment of seizures that, according to the arrest of the prison administration, resulted from a fall in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of deliberate murder following the appeal of the prosecutor to the original sentence for an indiscriminate murder.
He killed Stenkamp early on the morning of 2013 in St. Valentine's Day, several times through the toilet door in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he had taken his friend for a night's party, which he was opposed to in the toilet.
The prosecutor stated that he intended to give another protest, this time against the six-year term of Pretorius, which, she said, was too soft.
The Attorney-General stated that the appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal would be considered this year.
The period of Pretourius can be increased by 15 years if the procurator is successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
A sign of non-existence was selected by a TV journalist who was suspected of losing his identity.
Stolen law enforcement officers have chosen a cut-off measure for men who have been attacked by a TV journalist Nikita Dwarve in a direct ephere from the Gorke Park on 2 August.
This is reported by the TASS with reference to the official representative of the MDG RF Irina Volk.
“In the context of a criminal investigation under section 116 of the U.S. F.R.R. (“Poboi”) against a 32-year-old man who was hit by a correspondent in the Central Cultural Park and whose name was dismissed by the Gorke, who was suspected of having a degree of restraint in the form of a sign of inequity and proper conduct,” Volk explained.
The representative of the IMF added that an administrative protocol on police non-compliance was drawn up for the suspect.
On Wednesday, 2 August, at the time of the direct ephere to Dnu VDV, an undiscovered man came and hit his face.
As it turned out later, there was no relation to VAT.
According to the U.S., the dissidents, on the contrary, tried to keep the mosquet.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal court status
According to the Bi-Ti-Wi TV, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal courthouses, as reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people placed in a place of displacement, including two Bulgarian citizens, was arrested.
They were released on the same day, while they are still suffering.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to the Bi-Ti-Vi TV that Bulgarian citizens had subsequently released.
The Greek authorities have increased the control of free camping and have already appointed serious punishments for all those who are caught in a state that is not intended for this place.
Checks will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may appoint a fine.
IMD Russia accused the Vice-President of the United States of the "cold War" ritory of the "cold War"
Statements made during the European tournament by U.S. Vice-President Michael Pence have been criticised by the Russian MIDA.
“It is sad to note that Washington is deeply concerned about the primitive ideologicalized printings during the cold war, which are completely de facto," said the Russian Foreign Office.
Thus, the MIDE responded to the words of Pensa on the "Russian threat" and the attempts to cross the border that they had been told in Podgorica.
The Russian MID indicated that the choice of "with the West or with Russia" and the uncertainty of the unprecedented entry of South-East Europe into NATO was destructive.
Russian diplomats also recalled that the United States had violated international law by using force to withdraw Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another wave of tension.
“We call upon the American colleagues to put an end to the selmination of Russia and its foreign policy line, which is constantly based on respect for partners and willingness to work together constructively, on mutual interest,” stated the Russian media.
Feldshire suffered in DTP with "fast" in Podmoskoy.
The TTP was in the subcontinent of Stupino, and as a result of an innocuous encounter with the "Quick Assistance" cart, it suffered from Feldshire.
Today about 08:10 msk has been hit by Mitsubishi's car with the emergency car in the city of Stupino Moscow area.
"As a result of the "fast" hit of the machine, the TASS announced in the press service GU MVD on the Moscow area.
On the site of the DPRK, law enforcement officers were working, and the circumstances of the case were clarified.
In the Odyssey area, a woman threw her newborn son back into a cellophone package.
On the evening of 3 August, a report from the local resident was received from the Department of Police that he had found a package with a young man in an unsustainable private home.
"In place of the incident, law enforcement officers and doctors who promptly brought the child to the medical institution," they reported to the Head of the National Police.
The doctors determined that the boy had been born within hours of his discovery, as evidenced by the existence of a doll.
A 36-year-old local resident was established during the first operational investigation.
It was also established that the woman had three other children.
As noted in the chapter, the family did not fall into the field of law enforcement, nor did it fall in particular.
The circumstances and causes of the proceedings have now been established by the police, and the decision will be taken.
Now the young man is under the supervision of the doctor.
As reported earlier, a 21-year-old woman in Nicosia threw her unborn child into the womb.
Grigory Leps: "I'm fighting, though 55 is not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian era, Grigory Leps, is in her late 50s.
Before the ceremony, the singer reported to the "Knowledge" suspect.
I remember how your "politinary" was noticed.
The special tent in the "Lowers", Gloria Geenor was full of names, a powerful sanding over the Moscow River.
You're a believer, then you'd like to spend your next five years.
Are they faked?
Speaking of profession, it was a successful period.
I worked a lot, I spent three times with restaurants all over the country, I gave 120-130 concerts a year.
He released two bad albums.
Of course, I'm not what I said 20 years ago.
Biotimes don't lie.
Five times as much as I did in my 30s, it's getting harder.
Still, I'm fighting, I don't want to stay.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm going to go up to another level.
You and your new album, first in three years.
Yeah, it's working on him now.
Of course, we've written everything in my studio, and now we're going to send it to Los Angeles.
It's called "What's So Serious?" in the same song, written with Timothy.
She's not ready yet, so we haven't even done it before.
We'll do it later when we take a clip on it.
And the album will be presented in November to a series of my public concerts in Moscow's Cross City Hall.
To your new plastic, you've got the hand of a class American drummer Chris Coleman.
You think you wanted him and your restaurant?
In my view, the Colman is one of the most outstanding drummers of the world today.
He came to me to study, wrote his party.
I invited him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson (a well-known drummer participating in various projects).
But for the long work in Russia, they took advantage of extreme conditions.
The matter was between €35 000 and €45 000 per month.
At that time, I thought that in the post-Soviet area, it was a place of worship for worthy musicians.
And he found Max Malishev's great drummer.
It's better to feed your own.
At times I want to touch any of them, not for what.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly praised at the international level.
It's about Western music magazines, and it's invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Way, listening to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists came with another executive technique."
Your album is in Los Angeles, American musicians are working with you, but you can't come to the United States alone?
Are you trying to remove this ban?
Now, honestly, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers who are dealing with this issue.
As a musician, I'm really sorry I can't fall into America.
I didn't say I was there.
The more you interact with these professionals, the better.
We don't know them, but we don't have this experience, schools.
In front of our audiences for 70 years, the challenges that American musicians have always faced have not been fully met.
They've been trying to make a maximum quality sound.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now why did the United Kingdom refuse me to come in ten years?
But I'm still going to give the British Embassy visa documents every year so that I can get back to work there and the most important thing to do.
The rest of Europe belongs to me.
And in August, you're planning a concert in Monaco, not a lawn, but an afs, right?
Yeah, there's a good sports hall in Monte Carlo, and I've already spoken there.
Now they were invited again, and as far as I know, all the tickets to the concert have been sold.
You're going to Randywew Lyme Wikule, which starts on July 20th in Yurmal?
She invited me, and I'm sure I did.
Lima is a remarkable singer and a great woman who is capable of giving herself and a beautiful eye, even a hat.
After restaurants and jubilant concerts, I know how much you want to talk to Vladimira High.
There's two albums with his songs in your chart.
When's the third time?
Probably next year.
But he's going to be completely different.
I want to write 80-90 high songs about the same thing as he did himself.
Only voice and guitar.
No other arrangement.
I'll be hired by our famous musician, Timur Vedernikov.
I'm trying to get involved in the album and Alexander Yakovlevic Rosenbaum.
I talked to him about it, we had a good relationship, but he's busy, so let's see how it works.
You and Boris Grebenski gradually entered his repertoire.
Maybe you'll write it down with the album?
Boris Boris Borisovic is a wonderful man and a great musician.
I went over with him a couple of times and asked him: ‘ Can I sing some of his songs?
He said, "Grigory, I will write down the Psalms, so that they may be fulfilled."
Please, try, come on.
It's probably interesting to write that album.
Until I have no such task, but in the future, in two years, if Boris Boris Borisovic is not going to object, I may be making such a project.
If you don't concentrate fully on your shopping center.
I guess you haven't signed a contract with all the artists you care about?
There are a number of executives that I would like to have under my wing, but they are self-contained.
You understand Sergey Lazareva?
Serja is a shining singer, I invited him.
I can't agree with his repertoire, but he is a professional and has his development strategy.
And in my center now there's Alexander Panayots, whom I put in the Goose.
We made a deal with him and we work with him.
In our pop music, these things are rare.
It will be a true regret if he does not attain the heights he deserves.
I'm trying to get him a repertoire. I'm taking the clips.
I'm hoping for a good outcome.
And I'm also trying to move forward with other artists in my center: I buy them songs, I'm crying, sometimes their tracks fall in the rotation of the telescopes.
If they don't reach greater heights, I'll still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
They'll get a record album on the way out, a couple of clicks.
And then, if they want, they can go their way, and I will not force them to return their money.
Although I would be pleased if one of them was successful in business and paid me the percentage we had agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to tell anyone to hide the oxygen.
Let everything work, break down, prove how I ever proved it.
If you're invited to make a restaurant tour in Ukraine tomorrow and guarantee entry into the country, will you?
I'm still invited.
It is mainly about closed events.
And what about the big tower...
I am the man of my country, the Russian, on my own belief, flew into Syria on the plane that then broke up.
If they say tomorrow that you need to fly to another point in the interests of the State, I'll take care of it.
And I'm afraid that bloggers and other critics are thinking about me.
I'm really sorry we had this situation with Ukraine.
Because I think we're one people and we should be together.
I'm sorry if that's the worst, at least in the near future.
And I used to give 40-50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
They met like hell.
Thank you very much.
And with a number of Ukrainian artists, Annie Lorak, St. Lobodoi, Artem Loic...
In Ukraine, the mass of the victims, and sincerely regret that they cannot now fully pass their talents on to a wide Russian audience.
Music must unite and entertain people.
I would be pleased to invite a class Ukrainian executive in Russia, such as Slav Wakarchuka, to have a joint concert with him.
But, I think, at this moment, it's unlikely...
Andreya Ohlopkova was exonerated with the cosmodrom
As was known as "E", the technical director of the outer space, Andrey Ohlopkov, began work at the State Space Science and Production Centre (HCSC) named Hroniceva.
He had previously been involved in the construction of the East space, but because of differences with the management of the Land and Space Infrastructure Centre (CENCI), he was transferred to the Moscow Philippines, where the production coordination took place.
Mr. Ohlopkova will not be reduced: the technical director's post will, at least, be removed, and the functions will be broken down by CENKI units.
As the Technical Director of the Eastern and Deputy Director of the CENCI on the technological development of Andrey Ohlopkov moved to work in the GCNPC on the name of Hroniceva, "E" told the top managers of several space enterprises, as well as the staff of the Government's staff.
"He's been working on a new post for a couple of weeks now," the "Y" colleagues in the industry explained.
There was a failure in the fourth quarter to receive an operational comment from CNCI, but Mr. Ohlopkov himself was not available for the comments.
However, the information "E" was officially confirmed in the CFP.
He decided to move to the production coordination director, they said to the company. Andrey Ohlopkov, who had before him the task of providing a running minimum for the first launch on the East Coast.
Mr. Ohlopkov moved to the CENKI work in 2013, with a limited space service in the space forces, in particular in Baykonur, and in Pleszecke, in the "Northern" space station, he took the position of the first deputy commander in the name of the Colonel.
In 2009, Andrey Ohlopkov became a criminal figure.
As a result, he was accused of having been accused of having received missing orders from regional merchants, but did not comply with the obligations taken to rehabilitate the assigned parts of the rockets in the Argangel area and the Republic of the Commission.
In 2012, the court of the jurors recognized him as innocent.
Its responsibilities for technological development were extended to various projects, but the main focus of them was the space gap in the Middle East.
At that time, the Federal Space Agency, Oleg Ostapenco, in an interview, said directly that the situation in the East “was critical already in October 2013.
The fact that a strategic error has been encountered in planning: the end of the strike and launch of the first launch of the Union-2.1 rocket was planned at the same time as the end of 2015.
In order to carry out the strike by the end of the year, the end of the strike had been decided in advance and the deadlines had been set from December to July 2015.
In order to speed up the process, CENCI specialists began to carry out a parallel installation of technological equipment on unsustainable facilities.
The main party to this idea was Andrey Ohlopkov.
Despite the existing risks and all the transfers (in place of December 2015 the Union flew only on 28 April 2016), this idea justified itself, says the source of "E" in the space: "We would have had no leave from the East at any time before, and would have been interested in the stream".
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, curator of the creation of the cosmodrom, called Andrey Ohlopkova his "cosmic Susani", but he was almost always asking for information about the flow.
Mr. Ohlopkov and the straight one, for example, suggested that the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Speech) be removed from the status of the sole executive on the East and work directly with subcontractors: "Why should we put all eggs in one corner of Spectro?"
This idea was supported by the Government.
Since 2017, CENCI has assumed the responsibility of the General Contracting Officer to complete the construction work on the launch and technical complex planned in the fourth quarter.
According to Mr. Ohlopkova's "E", the reason for the transition to a new workplace was the disagreement with the CNCI's guidance on how to complete the space and space complex and how to work with subcontracting organizations.
"It was decided that this would be better for everyone," said one of the top managers who participated in the East.
The staff member of the Government, in turn, called for a strange solution: "He was one of the best specialists, finding a equivalent replacement would not be easy."
According to "E", this will not be necessary: the position of the technical director of the space will be removed and its functions will be broken down by CNCI units.
Two specialty education programmes will be presented in music schools
In the future, students of children’s music schools will be able to obtain two specialties at the same time.
According to the Under-Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Minkulture of St. Golubenko, it is possible to recalibrate further disciplines to students, and the issue of paying the rest of the work on second-hand, through special grants, is referred to as the RIA News.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue under control, and we, together with the expert community, develop a mechanism that will enable two specialities to be developed, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education," Golubenko said.
In the past Friday during the Nedet Talk, Maria Andreeva, a student at the Syrian Children's Centre, Vladimra Putin, reported that he had to pay for the second specialty in the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she was studying in the script and fortification class and had prizes for both directions.
The Head of State recognized the issue very relevant and promised assistance.
In Mexico, 17-year-old Russians were detained on the ground floor.
In Mexico, 17-year-old Russianman Kirill N., who reports on the wall of the roof of a tall building, reports the Portal El Universal.
An incident occurred in the capital of Mexico.
She, with the help of two unknown men, passed through a three-footed plot on the territory of the Nestle office complex and took herself to one of his bazaars.
He did not use any special equipment, insurance and trusts.
The young man has already been held on the cross.
The Ministry of Public Security has dropped it on the ground on the helicopters.
Thereafter he was sent to the National Institute for Migration.
They will find out whether the youth is legally in the territory of the country.
In the meantime, the video with the young man who picked up the top became popular in the network.
The users called the young man "man-pouch."
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate can help to ease the HCV.
Red meat and chocolate are accepted as a nightmare for your food basket.
Recent studies, however, have shown that diets, rich in fat whites and milk products can help alleviate symptoms of those who suffer from inflammatory diseases.
It is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in Britain, leading to deaths and deaths of life, chronic or blood loss, weight loss and extreme maturity.
Usually, patients are advised to avoid meat and milk products, but researchers from Washington University have found that the main amino acids of the white triptofan are helping to produce immune cells that increase the tolerance of the fluid.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that the immune cells in the refrigerator are being monitored to prevent the presence of food-borne microorganisms.
Cells capable of launching the combustion process are equivalent to cells that increase tolerance, protect the body and do not harm sensitive tissue.
If the equation is too severe to burn, it can lead to inflammation of the bottle.
Experiments have shown that mice with a certain bacteria in the bottle have an increased tolerance of cells.
And this bacteria need triptophan, one of the building components of the protein, to begin with the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of the normal oxygen microorganism, and the development of the population of cells that enhance tolerance.
The more triptophane was fed into the meat, the more these immune cells had them."
He suggested that the same would be true of people: the combination of L. reuter and rich tropical diets could contribute to a more tolerant and less prone to the burning of the environment in the kitchen.
Dr. Luisa Servantes-Barraganvas, who studied the diversity of immune cells, found that one group of infected mice had these cells, and another group that belonged to the same line, but had not been separately.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the microbiotics of the mouse — the communities of bacteria, viruses and flu, which normally live in the ice-creasing tract.
The DNA of the bone marrow cell was sequenced and six types of bacteria were detected in mice with immune cells, but not in mice that did not have them.
Mushrooms developed in the sterile environment with no good microorganisms and not developed this type of immune cells received L. reuters, and their immune cells appeared.
In order to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers have developed L. reuters in the liquid environment and then transferred a small fraction of the fluid - without bacteria - to the inborn immune cells released from the muscle.
Immune cells have become more tolerant cells.
When the active component was separated from moisture, it was a side product of triphytophan processing known as indol-3-molec acid.
When researchers doubled the number of triptophans in dogs, the number of these cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the level of triptophan was reduced twice, the number of cells also fell twice.
Dr. Servantes-Barragan explains that people have the same increasing tolerance of cells as the mouse, and most of us have L. reuter in their ice cream.
It is not known whether triptofan by-products from L. Reuters contribute to the development of cells in humans such as mice, but in people suffering from tropical diseases, defects in triptofan-related genes have been detected.
She says: “We may need to strengthen the development of these cells, as these cells depend on internal combustion processes.
The high levels of triptophans with L. reuters could potentially lead to their population expansion."
According to Jose Mourinin, Manchester United ganization in the face of Germany Matic
Manchester unaited, a genius in the face of Nemania Mattica, considers José Mourin after the semi-protection in the battle against Sampdoria in the middle of the night.
The game, acquired for 40 million pounds in Chelsea, began with the victory with the number 2-1 in Dublin in the last pre-consistencies of the UEFA World Cup against Real Madrid on Thursday, and produced an impression of the role of the winner while the players of Paul Pogbe and Andreas Perry broke up before they forgot.
However, as Mattic did not take part in the Chelsea Presbyterian Tour in Asia, he did not seriously miss the training for the game, and he held for 45 minutes that, according to Mourin, he was required to prepare for the beginning of the premier season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his thinking, he thinks about football," said Muurin.
“We will help him prepare for it sooner than later.”
So did Mattic, his new friends, Victor Lindeloff and Romeo Lukaku, who started playing at the Avava Stadium when Mourin began to form their main composition at the beginning of the next season.
The Independent newspaper reported this week that Mourini wanted to borrow three more games, but pointed out that the club had already achieved fantastic results, three out of four players he wanted to hire first.
"I am grateful to him for bringing three of the four parties together," he said.
I will do more, if they can get me four, but they are very old for me."
The former leaders of the Lithuanian Social Democrats claim to remain in the ruling coalition
The former presidents of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, the former Prime Minister of Algerias Butkivičus and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former speaker of the Social Democrats of Cheslovas Yurschenas, called on the parties to remain in the ruling coalition.
As the Parliamentary newspaper reported, due to training with partners - the Union of Crestians and Greens - a debate in the Social-Democratic Party has begun, should be held in the ruling coalition.
There were three major experienced partners, in particular: "The disappointment of the party's partner with the results of the elections, but the association with the "Cristians" has created for us a light and not a lot easier, but all the conditions for further implementation of the social justice goals set out in our initiative in the government programme and for the maintenance of the political domain of the left centre on the right parties."
According to the former leaders of the party, the discussion continued to “have an emotional basis for expressing the opinion without specific arguments”.
The authors fear that unexpected actions by their party could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
The disabled Anton Mamaev appointed a strike
Mosgorsud reduced the punishment of the disabled colleague Anton Mamayev from four and a half years of deprivation of liberty to the strike in 200 thousand rubs.
The former decision of the Timorese Court of Justice has been dismissed from the CYZO.
In this connection, Mosgorsud confirmed that the accused was a criminal because he had organized the theft and theft of the motorist in the former fighter of specialty.
Mosgorsud, in his decision, reduced the punishment of Anton Mamaev to 200 thousand rubies.
“Mamaev is the organizer of the controversy that also constitutes the composition of the crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be brought to criminal responsibility,” explained the press Secretary of Mosgorsud Uljan Solopov.
In this case, the court took into account the state of Mamaeva's health, the actual circumstances of the case, the absence of the circumstances.
In addition, the court applied paragraph 64 of the RFF, which provides that the penalty could be imposed below the limit.
With regard to the assistant of Mamaeva Vasilia Serostanov, the court did not establish circumstances that would serve as a basis for changing the burden of the judge and changing the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself stated that he remained dissatisfied with Mosgorsud's decision.
I'm disappointed in the court's decision.
The only legal solution would be a justification to continue to fight for justice.
His lawyer, Andrey Orlov, did not exclude the appeal of the sentence in the Mosgorsuda and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the goods immediately to the European Court of Human Rights," he said, "REA News".
Remember, 28-year-old Moscist Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscle atrophy, became a criminal figure last year.
The disabled claims that he bought a motorist in the 160,000 rubs to sell then.
However, the owners of the motorists, among whom were the former combatants of technology, claimed that the disabled and his assistant, Vasili Serostan, had chosen their property, threatening the use of violence.
On 30 June, the Regional Court of Moscow sentenced Vasilia Serostanov to three years in the colony, and Anton Mamayev, to four and a half years of deprivation of liberty in the general regime (para. 2 p. 162, para.
After the displaced persons were placed in the SIZO, the Public Chamber, the Genocortura, authorized by human rights in the presence of President Tatyana Moskalkova, was seized.
As a result, in the middle of July, Anton Mamaev was released from the SIZO by the same decision of the Timorese Court.
Protection, in turn, called for the decision of the first instance in Mosgorsud.
UNFPA will prepare a report on the environment to the President
In 2017 the Open-ended Action Forum of the People ' s Front (UNF) will be on environmental issues, reported to UNF by the "Immediate" source and confirmed the head of Alexei Anisimov's mission.
As a result, the Forum plans to prepare the president ' s report on the problems of home environment and to propose a strategy for their decision.
The UNF briefings noted that the report of the Head of State would contain a “deep analysis” of the situation in all federal areas.
According to the "Knowledge" data, the UNFPA outcome forum is closed.
The exact date of its operation has not yet been determined - as a rule, it is under the schedule of the President, who is the leader of the movement and is traditionally present in key activities of UNIFEM.
Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one in two federal districts, in Rostov-Na Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The conference will be held in the capital of the Republic of Bulgaria, Ulan-Udé.
On the basis of proposals that have been made and will be put forward for these events, we and we draw up systematic proposals to address environmental problems, as told by the United Nations Conference on Information.
The Co-Chairperson of the Centre for the Movement of Olga Timofeva, head of the Committee of the Gosdumas on Environment and Environmental Protection, reported that "Frontows" would report to the Head of State on the work carried out in Russia during the Year of Environment.
The resulting environmental forum and the UNFPA Forum of Action will, most recently, be updated.
Over the year, we raised a strong team of environmental experts, saw gaps in legislation, and stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will lead to a report that we are preparing for the president as the leader of our movement.
In addition, the "Frontows" were also reported on the work on the priority projects of UNIFEM, which was told by Olga Timofe.
She said that the Forum would also be invited to serve as a special representative of the Head of State on environmental, environmental and transport of Sergei Ivanov.
He had previously participated in the UNF Media Forum, which passed to St. Petersburg in April.
Within a few months, the Year of Environment will go back to history, and the most important thing to do today is to start environmental mechanisms to work for years.
To prevent these issues from happening, she added Olga Timothy.
The head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute of Social Studies (ESI) noted that the emerging environmental problem, UNIFEM, was acting on the presidential agenda.
Many things they as experts have proposed at various forums, and these initiatives have been supported by the President, Andrey Kolyadin said.
He stressed that the economic potential of the environmental agenda could not be excluded today, which could give regions an additional impetus for development.
The expert added that, with the help of UNFPA, the regions would be able to define not only the solution to their environmental problems but also the development of eco-tourism.
The reality of the environmental issue was demonstrated by the “direct line” with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President asked questions about the mortuary in the Balalayhe (closed) and the coal dust in the port of the city of Nahok (a draft law on the prohibition of the open coal ship in public places, one of the authors - Olga Timofeva).
Environmental experts believe that the legal framework for resolving environmental problems in Russia is generally established, the issue is in further legal practice, as well as in the position of civil society.
There is a need for clear implementation of the decisions taken by the State - the head of the Ecology Fund for All - Leonid Bochin.
A member of the PSC, the head of the non-governmental organization Greens of Russia, Sergei Chiplenkov, in the discussion with the Information, stressed that a responsible approach for society and business, one of the legislative efforts needed to address environmental problems successfully.
As society and business are aware that environmental problems are a much more effective step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change, stated Sergei Chiplepkov.
The expert stressed the need to overcome the tendency that environmental legislation violations were a economically beneficial solution for business.
The British miner used his microchip to fall into the house and car by hand
The British miner became the first man in the country to be established by the microscope so that he could open the door of his house, enter the office, and even drive the car with the help of a simple lift.
Thirteen-year-old Stephen Nortem has been using a cross-sectional chip between large and visible fingers and now through his BioTek company, he offers this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives by using technology.
He joined Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist from the Royal Council of Winchester, concerned that the treatment procedure would be carried out in accordance with medical standards.
Technology is like a microchip that consumes cats and dogs, and the procedure takes 30 seconds.
Nortama also exchanges lockes in houses and cars at a cost of 300 pounds per lock.
The father of one child has already established technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which happens when his hand is on the wheel.
White House requisitions for taxpayers in thousands of dollars
According to the records of the armed forces provided by the TIME magazine, the decision of the White House last month to bring a fleet of seabirds to the South Pole for an event related to American industrial production amounted to a total of $24,000.
White-green Sikersky VH-3D, known as Marine One, was a central element of the event in the White House on 17 July in which American construction programmes were demonstrated.
President Donald Tramp, Vice-President Mike Pens and the White House senior officials looked at technology products from all fifty states.
The helicopter, produced in Connecticut, was set up with a train from the state of Man, a fire car from Wisconsin and a driver from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Iscadry of the Seabirds (HMX-1), a department responsible for the management of the helicopter, the White House military administration has ordered the presence of a helicopter in private order, or “FRAGO”, within 36 hours of the landing of the helicopter on the South Pole in case of an “unnormal” event.
“I just wanted you to make sure that you were in the course, because this is an unusual event in the press,” wrote Commander HMX-1 in an e-mail to his boss, the first deputy of the Marine Flight Corps, the threat of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Pole about 7 o'clock in the morning on 17 July for the three-day event and will remain there until the gas is released between 6 and 9 o'clock on the same day.
The letter adds that if the Office of the White House is to be stopped, a second crew will be needed for the return field in accordance with the time limits.
The first crew escorted the helicopter during the operation, and unit security officers remained with the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It was not clear from the records received by the Times magazine whether the second ship was needed.
The Hetcha Act prohibits federal servants from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the event was contrary to that decision.
“Of course, we asked whether this had not been a violation of Hetch’s law and replied that it was not,” wrote the commander.
"It seems like you've got nowhere to go," said the deputy chief.
The “America” event was announced in the White House as an official event, and the Hetcha law did not apply to it.
But even official activities have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to promote health reform, which was then under way in the Senate, and praised efforts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is hardly new.
The Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But to ask them only for photos are unusual.
The tramp was already the subject of discussions in February when the presidential plane was on its back during his first pre-election mission in Melbourne, Florida, and his account in Twitter was damaged by complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
"The White House in the spring of the "America" exhibition, where products from 50 States made by American workers from American materials were presented," said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House of Lindsey Walters.
HMX-1 often operates training land around Washington agglomeration and on the South Ouija board to drive the President of the United States to the White House directly to the roof.
When the tramp was at the G-20 summits in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training trips to the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight carried out for the “America” activity was counted from the required training flights per month.
The units' helicopters also flew 11 additional hours that day under the “non-president support tasks”.
According to the White House, not one of the other exhibits submitted to the event was the cost of taxpayers.
The representative of Sikorsky reported that the company did not participate in the demonstration of the helicopter in South Ljujaka.
HMX-1 does not take account of the budget in the presidential fields, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount of the event.
However, according to the Department of Defence's time rate for 2017 fiscal year, the rate of reimbursement of the Ministry of Defence for VH-3D is $24,380 during the summer.
The unit records indicate that the flight time in the air was 30 minutes per side with its aircraft based on the Quantico Marine Aviation Base in Virginia.
The White House claims that the actual value of using the helicopter is much lower than that rate.
“Calculate the value of taxpayers based on an exemplary rate of refund,” says Walters.
“These examples include personal composition, service and many other non-recoverable costs, which are included in annual allocations”.
According to a study conducted in 2015 by REND, reimbursement rates do not include the value of the personal composition, but actually take into account the value of the fuel, services and costs specified in the treaty.
At the time, the former White Secretary of the House of Shawn Spiceser was referring to protecting the use of the valve for the operation.
“The idea of demonstrating things done in America this week,” Spiceser said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut companies are very proud that they are contributing to national security, and that there are, I guess, hundreds, if not thousands of people, whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and another military technique that has worked so hard to create so many Americans.
That is why, of course, it is appropriate to pay attention to this.”
It was unusual to have Tramp interacted with the helicopter looking at the South Pole during the event, but he lived on the railway station in a fire car.
In the White House, Tramp turned to Sikorsky's representatives, with a press on his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikersky very well," said the president. "I have three of them."
Moscow will grant benefits to urban hospitals rehabilitation offices
Each year, the life-saving gloves will be allocated to the rehabilitation and intensive treatment of capital clinics.
The media encourage doctors and medical sisters.
Mr. Moscov Sergey Sobianin visited the City Hospital named Judin.
During the clinic examination, he wrote a letter of thanks to Dr. Victor Procco, a doctor who was guided by a more complex operation on the reconstruction of the ageing rate.
Sergei Sobianin also discussed the decision to assign annually to the rehabilitation and intensive care offices of the urban clinics of Granite.

There are currently more than a thousand patients receiving medical services.
In addition to the repairs and the stationery, there are daily offices.
The state of hospital staff is estimated to be 2800.
The total area of the clinic is 23.7 g.
In February of this year, the agency became a participant in the pilot project for the organisation of short-term housing stations (SCPs).
They are intended for relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical intervention, advanced medical equipment has been used to significantly reduce patients ' rehabilitation time.
After the operation at the station, they've been doing everything for hours.
Only after the first half of the current year in the hospital, the name of the hospital has been given to 36,000 patients.
Medical staff performed 15800 operations of different levels of complexity.
NBU reported that there were no buyers of Ukrainian "dots" Sberbank

Electricity is also available for residents, and for Buritian producers
More than a decade of efforts by the Soviet and Portuguese authorities of the Republic of Burkina Faso (East Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity users are beginning to produce fruit.
From 1 September, 25 per cent of electricity is reduced to low pressure for industrial recipients.
The Federal Anti-Fraud Service of the country, in accordance with the RF Government ' s Decision, " To make changes to the optical energy market regulation and the combined forecast balance of production and supply of electricity (power) within the framework of the Russian Energy System for Russian Federation entities " (from 17.07.2017 No. 842), established an indicative price for electricity and power for industrial consumers in the Republic of Bulgaria.
As a result, the cost of electricity for Burt producers is reduced to four, which will greatly facilitate the lives of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual enterprises.
For many decades, the leaders of the Republic have challenged the efforts of Moscow's cabinets to compare the region in tariffs with the nearby Irkutsk area with the cascade hydroelectric power station in Angar, from Baikal, the main source of water for which Burundi is located.
And only this year did the movement begin.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population were reduced from 4.24 rubs/kVtch to 3.93 rubs/kVtch, or 7.3%.
Includes the Federal Government Decision Bureau in the List of Price Areas of the Optic Market, which sets out the characteristics of the operation of the optimum and diverse markets across industrial consumers.
According to analysts, this was only beginning because the population of the Irkutsk area was paying for 1.01 rubles.
However, no one would be ashamed to mention the near date of the new tariff movements due to the decline in Burundi.

National trade union of unqualified, municipal and coal workers (GMB) concerned about the capitalization of McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The trade union requires guarantees from the managers of McVitie's biscuit manufacturer in connection with his long-term obligation to manufacture a factory in Glazgo.
The Scotland GMB reported that the company was involved in the darkness of the future investment in a multi-crossed facility.
More than 500 people are working in the manufacturing industry, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea.
The company Pladis, owner McVitie's, reports that over the past few years, it has invested more than 5 million pounds.
The company adds that in the event of any changes in the work of staff members and trade union representatives “know them first”.
In a letter to the manager of the property owned by the company, the Scottish GMB requested McVitie's responses to concern that funding would not be allowed to modernise production lines.
The senior organizer, Dr. Duffy, said: “The members of our union are deeply concerned that we cannot get the insights from the manager-General of the business and investment plan on the future of Tolcros".
Families have worked here for generations and the concentration of large labour in local society and in the territory of the Greater Glazgo; this is an important pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social exclusion.
Thus, from the point of view of jobs, wages and promotions, and on the basis of Breszita, the growth of the living minimum and the chronic decline of production, East-End Glazgo is desperately needed in the development of production at McVitie's factory.
According to the representative of Pladis, “The Head of the Tulcrosian facility only received a letter from the Scottish GMB office yesterday, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our continued cooperation with staff and trade union representatives”.
Two months ago we held a regular meeting with staff and representatives of GMB in Tolcrosse, where a number of issues were discussed openly.
We talked to the staff about that, like all companies working under the maximum competitive and unstable economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions – and that is all of our projects and activities – to remain competitive.
“For the past few years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our multi-crossed facility, particularly in production lines and improved functional indicators.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolkross as a productive object, and in the event of any changes in its work, staff and trade union representatives are aware of this first.”
Putin stated that the authorities would not give Rosnefti and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin stated that the gas supply to the East Petroleum Company (WNHC) should be included in the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers, but no one would give the Gasproma as well as Rosnefti.
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to the request of Igorya Secina to assist in resolving the dispute.
The Head of State noted that the relations between "Rosneft" and "Gaspromo" should be resolved solely on the basis of market principles.
The former head of Rosnefti Igorh Sechin at a meeting on the implementation of major investment projects in the Middle East Federal District said that the lack of agreement with Gaspromo on gas for the HICP threatened the project.
Secin noted that dialogue with the Gaspromo continued on this issue.
Gasprom suggests finding gas resources from the Rosnefti perimeter, but we don't have such resources, Secin added.
Remember that Rosneft asked for permission to use the gas from the Gasproma gas station located on the Sakhalin Shelf.
In June, Gasprom stated that negotiations on this issue continued and that there was “no sharp angles”.
Did the PSJ Barcelon warn of the three years ago of the transition from Nemara?
La Ligi can ask for his interest in Marko Verratti
“Pari St. Germany” will not cease to pursue Nemara after the club has proposed 189 million pounds for his ransom, but have they warned Barcelona of the world record of the leases held three years ago?
The Sensation proposal was restored by an summer transfer window when the League 1 Club was ready to receive a world transfer record more than twice the previous note relating to the return of Poland Pogbe to Manchester, United States, in the last session of 89 million pounds.
When the transition is over, Niger will become the most expensive game in the world, as well as the most highly paid professional sportsman in the world, as the PSP offers it to pay more than 500,000 pounds per week.
It is well known that Barcelona and the clarity of the proposed proposal and how Nemer broke the contract, despite the fact that, as a source, near the head of the Catholic club, the club has always done everything possible for the game since it moved from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the football world warned of this three years ago by the President of the PSP?
When Manchester City expressed interest in the 2014 Blezza Matthews, Nasser Al-Heliffi made a serious warning to any club that would want to change one of the best games of the PSP.
"I am not concerned because they know that if they attack one of our games, we will attack them, and we will offer their games," said Al-Halifi.
“We respect every club.
But if they try to hide one of our games, they will have a great reward."
In all of this, Barcelona has crossed that line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed interest in the protectionist Marko Verratti.
The PSC understood that it would not leave the Italian game of collection under any circumstances, and now Barcelona is likely to feel the impact of its proposal on the loss of one of its most valuable games, Nemira.

At first Putin left a few little ones out of the bag.
Then he went for a special piece of paper on a chain of containers and threw the others out.
During the trip, the leader also ordered to deal with the environmental situation in Baikal and to build a road on the island of Ollong.
