In Herson, the people went to migrating again, the Russians didn't get to break up
As told by the board of directors, the Hersonians were able to do a meting before they arrived at the scene to break up the military ruf with technology.
"We've come to do a meting. Now the ruf technique has arrived," said one of the participants.

Green: Mariupol - the heart of war, ceases to fight - we will have weak positions
President Volodimir Zelenskiy believes that wars in eastern Ukraine and in particular in Mariupol will determine the time of war – and if the U.S. forces fail there, the Russians can leave negotiations and buy over and over again occupied territories.
The right word is, "Mariepol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It's winning. We're fighting, we're strong.
If it stops fighting, we'll have a weaker position.
They (city defenders) are people who have raised a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupoli, the stronger our position will be in the eastern states, in the (areas) of the OOS, and if they are stronger, the more the table of discussions will be closer to us and we will have the advantage of dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, we may not expect to meet.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to return even to the cities that we have now purchased.
They can go on.
Then our situation in the debate will be weaker and may not even be of interest to the Russian side.
I'm sorry, we're finding out.
We believe in our outcome, in our victory...."
Details: Zelenski also said that it would be difficult to negotiate after the Koreans had been beaten, but "we should not lose the possibility of a diplomatic solution if they are in us."
The right word is, "People will get peace in any case, because people want this war to end.
In our circumstances, the independence of Ukraine, but... every family has lost something, and I don't think they'll be satisfied with any peace under any circumstances.
But if we are not emotionally speaking, war should end in peace, or millions of victims.
And even where millions of victims are, everything comes to an end.
Yes, we must fight — but for life.
You can't fight for the chicken, when there's nothing left, there's no people."

There are amazing (without prejudice) information resources on growth like the Death Bar, which clearly reminds us of the events of those years.
Thus, in modern - day growth, NKWDists have found ways to punish and destroy almost everyone who has seriously investigated the crimes of their predecessors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass victims of Stalin’s repressions and who publicly wrote the name of the killer were initially disdegraded and then destroyed.
Apparently on the computer, they found files with child pornography, put them in jail, and died there.
The KGB are now killing those who are trying to learn the truth about the crimes of the past century.
So why are you suddenly surprised by their actions now?
It focuses on the most important aspects of human nature.
Over a thousand years of Ordinian tradition was imposed on slavery and imperialism in the 16th and 19th centuries.
And then over what happened, they made a fascinating genetic experiment by cutting up intelligence for a few minutes of red terrorism.

As the European Truth reports, it's written by Worldt with reference to the source of government in Ukraine's streets.
According to the publication, the proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economics on Saturday.
The value of 100 rubbers, including a learning set and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
Also proposed are the Goubies in the BTR Boxer option for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in the battle must be loaded relatively close to the enemy’s target, Panzerhaubitze 2000 can carry fire more than 30 miles [30 km] away.
As the Ukrainian government has reported on the KMW proposal, the provision of self-sustained rubber will be under a circle of scheme.
In the shortest term, the Bundesver will give Kiev 100 gougers, and the prognosis that they have created will then be filled with industry at the second stage.
The first new guabs can be placed 30 months after the contract was signed, that is, before the second half of 2024.
The full supply will not be completed by 2027.
And that's the first half of the day, or the second half of the day together?

I really want to be with you.
Make you happy.
I don't know, honey, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I'm going to put it like we're together.
I'd say there'll be a lot of work after the war.
So I'm not afraid I won't find her there.
I've got a lot of skills.
So I'm not afraid I didn't get into any of them.
I just don't know how to live.

I don't want to misunderstand you.
Because I'm going through it so it's all right!
We didn't even talk about it with these excavators!
I understand how important it is for you!
And I'm talking about myself (for me it's just a top that doesn't reach)!
How do you feel today after the celebration?
Hey, sorry, I just broke up, I slept bad.
I'm sorry I'm worried.
I was so upset that yesterday we were having a bad test with Cole.
I'll ask Gregory Deniseck or perhaps Yoonashek) to help me with some mathematical concepts.
Can I and I be useful?
If that's possible, I want to support mathematical terms for the exits.
The geometry is quite complex, but we have to work with Cole so it's no mistake.
Thank you for the test job
We're looking forward to that too.
And so she's very happy to be a gift.
Yab wanted to connect the Internet to his Czech number
Last night, at the end of the 402 buses, I met Ukrainian Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is... her eyes full of tears and pain...

So she didn't worry that no one came.

So you're leaving town for a long time?
A year later, at the memorial center of the Holocaust, Babin Yar, in Kiev, we celebrated 80 years of a mass bombing by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babin Yar.
I had the honour to speak after three heads of State, including the President of Germany.
He spoke of "a common foundation of international law and human dignity, freedom of people to choose their ways and lives in the territorial integrity, peace and security of Europe.
It is also part of our responsibility, which is related to our history."
"If the demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "then for us, Germans, there can be only one answer: never again!
The fight has to last."
Today, Russia attacks a peaceful country, bombes and kills thousands of peaceful people, destroys the hunger of its citizens, and kills them from disease.
The Russian army is engaged in mass bombings of the Koreans, and this is a visual reminder of the bombings in Granny Yaru.
More than a month ago, Germany saw this in the news in real-time mode.
Yes, Germany imposes sanctions, gives humanitarian aid, and weapons that have not been possible for so long.
Germany is responsible for the heavy arms supply needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not just to speak against the property.
This means fighting all possible means of mass murder, genocide, war crimes, and wild animals.
There is no easy way out of risk and sacrifice to overcome evil and stop wild animals that are happening in Ukraine.
A Song for the Night
We are willing to make an appointment and write down when we are together
All the patients except Lydia didn't. They had a new kind of cod.

Sergei Sidorenko: Our NATO membership has ceased to be a far-reaching prospect
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Koreans were opposed to NATO entry and only 18% of respondents said "after".
After the Hidnosis Revolution, Victor Janukovic, anecdox of Crime and the beginning of the Danube war, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and the hostages, on the other hand, to grow.
Following the start of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists had established a record level of support for Ukraine's entry into NATO among Ukraine's citizens over 75 per cent.
Despite the support of Ukraine's entry into NATO and the assistance that NATO is making in the war, there is now a lot of criticism on the Alliance's and members of the country's accounts – for the temporary supply of weapons, for refusing to close the sky, for refusing to "drink" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will have to decline from the hope of membership in the Alliance through the REF position if it can stop the war and Ukraine will have secure security, including military.
In the new episode, we talk about how Ukraine's Alliance has helped since Russia's invasion to criticise NATO and why Alliance's perspective on NATO's membership is closer than ever in history and what security guarantees are discussed in the talks with Russia can be a different Budapest memoranda.
What Do You Think?
I've got a partner on the loose that I'm looking at.
I gave it to her by means of this mobile addendum.
We don't have visas, we need to go to the convention center and learn how to do it because it was formed in Poland, there was no visas, and there was no passport.
We're going to write you down!

Yes, there was a heart attack.
I had a real feeling about this man, but he didn’t do the right thing, and I left him.
In time, he came back and apologized to me.
I rejected him.
Then, after a while, he called for an operation on his heart.
He just asked me to talk to him, and I felt sorry for him.
I supported him psychologically for almost half a year.
During this time, we had many conversations.
At that time, I began to have problems at work.
His support also helped me at the time.
That's mutual help.
And I was wondering, maybe you really need to look at him differently.
And he suggested that I get married and die two days later.
So God has decided our destiny.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
And he's only talking about Czech.
She wanted to tell me that I was able to find a place to live, and I am very happy that I now have where to live and where to be with my child.

The Russian army threatens to launch rocket attacks on Kiev: they say, "They haven't done it before."
The Conashenkova's direct language: "We're trying to make a difference and task of the attacks by Ukrainian troops on the RF territory.
If such events occur, the armed forces of the RFF will strike at the decision-making centres, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army has previously been detained."
The Russians had launched rocket attacks on Kiev from the first day of the full-scale invasion of the RFP forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, the rest of the Russian rockets, which destroyed the Ukrainian PPO system, fell into a multi-circuit building on the capitals of the Poznakas.
On February 26th, the Russian rocket took over many of Valeria Lobano’s adventures.
On March 1, the Russians arrived at Dorogojijas near Grandfather Yaru, and five of them died.
On March 2nd, the Korean DPRK was hit by Russian rockets flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defence.
On March 14 the attack rockets destroyed the house and trolleybus at Kurenovica, Kiev
On March 18, the Russian rocket took over the living mass of Vinogradari, from which one person was killed, and 19 others were injured, including four children.
On March 21, Russian rockets destroyed the current TRC Retroville in Vinogradari, resulting in at least 4 deaths.
Mr. Kieva Vitali Klicko, who said on April 13th, that the capitals who had been evacuated from the city had returned before they had returned.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still make rocket attacks on Kiev, and in addition, around the centuries, there were many mines and unsightly fighting rifles.
The main administration of the Ministry of Defence's development in Ukraine has announced on 12 April that the Russians are planning to launch the first low-ranking tracts on the territory of the U.S. to accuse the Koreans and to set forth the Russian army’s violence against the civilian population.
On April 1, at Belgorod, Russia, the oilbase was bombed, as was the result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, the local government of Belgrade declared that near the city it seemed to fall into the "Ukraine Snare".
It is evident that Elite and Washington, and Berlin are falling in a cold path from the very thought that Nazi destroyers will strike Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelenski speaks not only with them but with their voters and societies as a whole.
With his talks in parliaments and before the thousands of crowds in Europe’s largest cities, the Korean leader is doing something that none of his predecessors have ever done before.
The Greenman does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he is convinced by the European nations that these politicians choose.
And these talks, which are filled with strength, excitement, and time of discouragement, gradually achieve their goal.
By the same time, Byden is categorically opposed to closing the sky, 70 percent of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels is opposed to the speed of Ukraine's entry, this process is already going.
I understand you, so they don't want us to be treated as cowards.
The costs you collect are better to give people more needed.

You decide to leave the children at home.

Now... there's going to be... something going on.

These are bus drivers who are now willing to travel to Humconies in the temporarily purchased area to get help and get people out of there.
These hero leaders, who fearlessly go to war zones, calm down and help refugees in the vehicles, and at peace stations help volunteers to engage in humanitarian activities.
These were the auto repairers who stood on the footing of the Jitom world in the first days of the war and patiently served the frightened and frustrated people.
These firemen, who are carrying garbage, refurbished the water and power lines to provide the people with the necessary equipment.

Ukraine's western electoral district (SWA) is an electoral area that combines electoral districts located within Ukraine's borders, and consists of premises for voting in Ukraine's missions and councils and military bases,[Vinos 1] on which Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and DRC) are located.[1] The role of the Regional Electoral Commission for the Western Electoral Region is the Central Electoral Commission.
In the Western electoral zone, the elections of the President and the national parliaments and the referendums are held only by the general government.
Local elections in the U.S.A. are not held.

Today I saw Christine’s mother, but she didn’t even greet her (
Very sweet apples, what's this for?
The head of President Andrey Hermak's office told us that Russia is starting a fire operation on the weapon that the allies are sending to us.
Direct German language: "They understand that they win the war, see their distance, and wish to "kill" arms transfers in any way.
For example, one of the last figures is the destruction of the Slovak C-300 SRC transmissions.
This information has already been made clear by Prime Minister Edward Heger.
What's going to happen?
They can start fires that the Korean soldiers seem to be armed by the allies, and they're massing into the Russian army.
I'd like to warn these guys right away.
Because a weapon in the hands of the military forces of the U.S.A. is the only enemy of that world.

We took all the room and moved into the second room.
The international co-operation continues to express shock and frustration after the evidence of Russia’s violence against the peaceful people in Ukraine has been shown, and Moscow has rejected these messages as a “provocation”.
"The announcement of the deaths, rapes and serious injuries to Russian soldiers of Ukrainian peaceful inhabitants is worth a trial," said New Zealand Prime Minister Jassinda Ardern to reporters in Wellington on April 4.
"Russia should answer to the world for what they have done," she added, stating that her government would discuss additional steps to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion.
Prime Minister of Japan Fumio Kisida called the incident "an international law breach".
Following reports of hundreds of peacekeepers were shot and shot in brother - in - law or left in the streets in the capital of Kiev, Buchi, by Russian soldiers who left the area after a few weeks of occupation.
Photographs on which the bodies of civilians who were killed with their hands were shocked by many and called for the promotion of sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the guilty.
France's President Emmanuel Macron announced in a radio interview on April 4, which is a sign of the "war crimes" committed by Russian troops in Buchi.
"What happened in Buchi requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," said Macron, adding that additional sanctions should be directed towards Russian exports of coal and oil.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez stated that Russian troops could go so far as to do "genocide" in Buchi.
"We will do everything we can to keep those who have committed these war crimes from being innocent," said Sanchez in Madrid.
In a public television interview on April 3, Russia’s MIC spokesman Maria Zacharov rejected the charges as “provocation. ”
Without evidence, she stated that the United States and NATO "required" the image to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minute after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts about who "sends" this story," said Zaharov.
Formerly, the Russian Minoborons also claimed without evidence that the picture of Buchi is “one of the key regimes” and that all Russian troops left the city until March 30th.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to gather on 4 April to discuss what it called “the cause of Ukrainian radicals” in Buchi.
On April 4th, the next Russian committee issued a statement declaring an "examination" on charges in the vast part of Ukraine "of course false information" about the actions of the Russian army in Buchi.
Ukraine's President Volodymir Zelenski said on 3 April, accusing Russian troops of genocide in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they had to come to Buchi to see what their troops had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are carried out," said Zelenski in a video interview, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And it's a joint responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for shooting in the basement," he said.
He stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian army should be responsible for the military action in Ukraine.
"When we find people bound behind their hands and arms, I don't understand," he said about the scene of victims scattered on the streets of Buchi, the city about 35 kilometers north-west of Kiev.
On April 2nd, the Ukrainian Radio Freedom correspondent saw the streets of a small town of civilians.
In just one place, the correspondent saw up to 10 people on the street.
The AP reporters saw at least 21 bodies in different areas of Buchi.
The body of one group of nine people – all in civilian – was thrown down on the ground near the place, which, according to local residents, used Russian forces as a base.
Apparently, the victims were killed from a nearby distance.
In general, the Ukrainian government stated that the bodies of at least 410 peaceful inhabitants were found in the area of Kiev, which had been controlled by Russian troops last week.
Thank you, everything is, we bought everything on the list.
"They said, "There's no key." The buyers exported the Koreans to Russia and Belarus.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by horrors: graves, rapes, murders, executions.
There is another point that is now much less information about the export of the local population into the territory of the enemy.
Near the middle of March, Russian buyers "evacate" Koreans from temporaryly occupied settlements in their territory and territory of Belarus, which President Lukaschenko himself has actually given under the Russian military law.
The "Ukraine Truth" sought out the Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the "Evacation" is happening and whether there are ways to return after it to Ukraine.
Hero of this text has become a volunteer evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from the free flow.
Fortunately, they live and maintain relationships with their families.
However, in view of the claim made by the Ukrainian government, many citizens were exported to Russia and Belarus under severe pressure.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second house, expelled children without parents, including 12-year-old Miroslav, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian champion from the flood of Joseph Zacapinski.
The family of Oleksandra, Marina, and their 10-year-old daughter, Vali, moved to Hostome in a few months to war.
Oleksandr himself got a job at Antonov Airport, which is located about five miles [2.5 km] from the village.
The family settled in the military center, although it was civil.
Like the real plastics, Dennis and Marina have long gathered anxious whales, but they haven't arrived on the morning of the 24th of February.
They had no cars, and the city buses were no longer taking anyone.
About 12 o'clock on the 24th day of February, they saw helicopters with Latin letter V, followed by the first planes.
One of them was taken to a neighbor’s house.
Then the family landed in the basement and stayed there for three weeks until March 17 until the Russian army took them to Belarus.
Nearly 40 people were buried in their basements.
Not everyone decided to go.
"On the sixth night of the 24th of February, people who spoke and did not speak Russian, and not Ukrainian.
They say, "Who is it?" They say, "Go away."
They were looking for me, asking who was in the basement if there was a gun.
All the men were asked whether they were serving in the army.
The women said, "We've come to protect you under the direction of Ramsana Cadida."
It was a Czech NGO, not even a military, young boy in 25-35 years.
They said, "We helped the Koreans in the war, Sachko White (commanded by the United Nations Nationalist Movement Wiking, which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chinese War, the U.S. War), now we're here to help you."
On the third day, they asked what was not enough for us.
We're saying the water was a big problem.
They broke down the store, took the goods out of the container "all the same Russian warehouse" and brought us six bottles.
There's still a video on the Internet where children thank Kadir for food.
So this is what they did after they took the warehouse and they said, "We understand it's wrong, but we really need a video for Ramsana Ahmatovich."
No one particularly wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful mess.
Our child there says, "You have 7 days to give us our phones" -- they laughed.
Still, they kept separate from the Russians.
They said, "Well, they came here because they didn't want war, the Koreans support it, and they're good at saying, "The road is a waste, the Kadrew too, but we can't do anything because our families are there."
And they didn't primarily fight, but they went to grab the stores, they were maroding.
The cows took them, one attached to one leg to the georgian arrow, the other to his white shoe and called it "the commander".
They came to Ukraine without any preparation.
I don't know how their divorce was working... when they were killed in Buchy, so they didn't even take the killers, they asked us, "What do you have, the artillery?"
Moreover, we had been arrested, and the two of us did not know each other, and the first day they asked the password to reveal their identity or their foreign identity.
They were with us until 13 March, after the Russian NATO arrived, and after them was a municipal desan.
They put 30-40 units between the houses, and we've always fallen into it from "Biractors".
But they came and told us that the U.S.U. is no longer there, but it's "Azov", and, according to them, "Azov" is 10,000 in Ukraine.
The "Kiev's already been asking" from the beginning of March.
A Russian officer, or a disannutrition officer, or a FBI representative, came to us and said that it would be evacuation.
And we listened to the radio -- it was about Buchu, Ghostmel, thinking, maybe we gave us a green corridor.
From the very beginning, we've handed down our lists, they've promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we're told, "You're being exported to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov."
We say we don't want either here or there.
And they said, "Oh, that's your children's psychotics!"
As it worked, they shot us in the basement and started shooting at us from the bottom of the house, either "Citizens", or "Minutes."
And then it flew back... nearby houses were just burned, part of them fell.
In our house there was a direct connection to the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us out to Belarus, promising to transfer us to our relatives and to the Red Cross.
The part didn't go, saying it's for parents' traitors, saying, "You're going to be shot, you're going to sell to the bodies."
We were taken through the Cornovil, on both sides of the road were burned, broke up the technique, even though the Belarusians told us that Russian technology was being exported immediately to them.
A lot of caponirators, buried techniques, and soldiers.
At the Belarusian crossing point, we've gone through the improvised control, many of whom were completely without documents because they were burned.
We were placed in the Red Cross halls, given a cup of tea.
And here we hear shots!
Even though they from the Belarusian Red Cross said, "No, these planes fly, they go to the border."
But we're from aviation, we have education, we understand that.
We were then forced into the bus and taken to the Chonky room near Gomel.
His leader, Wenger Vasil Stéanovich, came, said, "You, I'm a hero, I'm with Montenegro.
But I understand that Putin and Lukaschen won't stop until these wolves get your balls.
The poor people are suffering!
We've got Lukaschenko so good!
He will say, "Yes, he will."
They offered to interview Belarusian journalists, but no one liked them.
The department's administration told us, "You're already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN (at least they called themselves so) have spread information that men in Poland cannot go.
Many believed in it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, even though we had a problem with the documents — the daughter had no passport.
We had to get it on Monday, and on Thursday the war started.
At the Ukrainian consular, we had nothing to do with anything, but in Minsk, we were told that no one would get on the bus without passports.
I'm going to say that the Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were assigned to Minsk, and the follow-up was carried out.
They didn't keep the force in the classroom.
Our second group of migrants said that you can spend the maximum week in the quarter here, because Belarus is not Europe, there's no payment here.
We found an intern who voted to take us out to Warsaw.
On the way to Mozira (about 50 miles [50 km] from the Ukrainian border, U.S.A.), we saw the launch of ballistic missiles in Ukraine: rockets begin to fly, beautiful world, and then gas.
The people sitting on the bus in Moziri told us that the Russians were always shooting at the Poles.
But I can say that the Belarusians do not want to fight at all.
The generals are released from the army.
One woman told us that something would damage a son if he were to be called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk, is not believed at all.
They will say, “You are mad, and we are a people of peace.”
They do not realize that their poligons are being used for the attacks of Ukraine.
In Poland, friends who took us to Estonia were waiting for us.
Now we're going through the registration, we're going to decide what we're going to do next.
In Estonia, the Ukrainian proposals are now probably as much as the Estonians."
Marina lived in the territory of a military town in Gostomel, along with her brother's family, his wife and two children, aged 18 and 22.
On the morning of the 24th of February, she called the tribes and asked them to collect the most necessary items and documents.
In the evening, they went to sleep under the roof of a neighbor’s house.
Marina herself was unable to return home, and in principle she could not, the house no longer exist.
No one knew anything about evacuation.
You can't go to the center on Monday?
Thank you, we've got everything. And we're always waiting for you!
Thank you for your welcome, beautiful furniture.
And in this little room, there's no whales, the main answer to all your questions is I don't know how to be? And in kids with Monday's online, there's no Internet.

Can we talk about how much better we can do this?
On April 1, the city head of Buchi Anatoly Fedoruk reported the happy news that the Korean army released the city on March 31 from Russian plunderers.
The next day, the appellants were expelled from the entire Kiev area.
However, the joy that the Koreans would feel at that time was filled with fear and hatred, for at the same time it became known that at least 280 Russians were scattered in one place.
They just killed them on the street, tied their hands to some and shot them in the basement, some of them were under the age of.
Killed and followed by torturers found the elderly village of Motizín Olga Suchenko, her husband, Igora, and his son, Oleksandra, who were kidnapped on March 23.
The bodies of Olga and Oleksandra were in the fraternal grave, Igora, in the canal.
Around 20 miles [20 km] from Kiev, several women who had been burned in the coroner were found dead.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go, no one will be home.
I ordered a link from Germany using DHL.

President Volodymir Zelenski said that certain types of weaponry that the Western partners have come too late.
That's what he said in an interview with the Associated Press, published by the President's Office, says "European Truth".
"All the equipment they already send, for some types of equipment it's done late.
So, for example, when we talk about Mariupol when you lose thousands of people, and now what?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100 percent support, that's really true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," said the Greens.
The question is, it's got enough weapons for Ukraine to make a difference in the war, the president answered, "No, no, no."
The president also said that if Ukraine was a member of NATO, this war would not be, or it would be otherwise.
"She'd be spreading, we'd have close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I'm sure the war wouldn't be that way," he added.
Remember, the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military assistance, including bronchitis and anti-terrorist weapons.

The Ministry of Education and Science in Ukraine has already simplified this phenomenon.
The last two videos will be displayed when you work on the Internet.
Is work boring or out - of - date, or is it possible to walk because of it?
Okay, he'll come over and pick them up.
I'm not jealous of everything.
I understand I can't sit down with you. I need to work.
Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 and we don't need Korean television at all.
I see all the news on the Internet.
And 1+1 is a presidential, propaganda channel, not interested in me at all.
What happened to the man at the stop of the police and the police?
Diana didn't answer me and you
All right, I just need to print the children's drawings, so it's gonna be okay, when can you come?

In this case, I know a girl who's a Ukrainian, but she's learning in Chechnya, on special tourism.
You really don't want to come in for a minute with the kids and the grandmother.
I want you to be with me.
It is generally difficult to find in a foreign country, and each day, it is more likely to be at home.
Mrs. Agata, if you need this photo, I'll take a photo.
Thank you for trying to make our lives better here.
I remember you all my life.
And I'll mention and laugh at you.
So thanks to Anna, she's still going through the geolocation on the phone so we can get better.

How I can see how useful it is.
And how do I get paid?
"I'm telling her that the TV and radio remont has been dragged through import details, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to touch the food when they call."
"We've been hiding the whole month from all the information about the war.
As long as it can.
However, in the Plumca (UP) on the sand and the back of the rocks, this can be caused by stress, change in the neck, and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been removed, and here's the stress I don't care about, unfortunately.
And the plague, unlike the plague of leprosy, shall not be heard; it shall be heard in the ears of the Syrians; and thou shalt blow it.
Because Olga hears bad news and spends most of her time in her room, her unbeknownst month lived in a room with her "incognito".
And on April 1, 93, Oksana Polova took the gun first in her life.
"33 days I, as a party, lived with her in the room.
The war was hidden from her, and what I was about to do was come as formally as usual for a few hours.
But when her husband spoke to her, I gave her a reception, she listened for four hours, then she sang for two hours."
The receiver was always at bedside.
Most of the time, the universe is in its own room.
I felt bad — it allowed me to be blind to her.
If I heard the sound of her walking, I would hide in my room.
First, she hid from her host and TV.
Then she phoned everyone she was talking to, it's 6-7 people.
She asked her to talk to her about anything, not just war.
I ask my friend, she was there from the beginning and to the end
Just 17 April--I got 2 quarters pick-up:)

The British who protected Mariupol in the Soviet Union says he's ready to give up in Poland to the Russians
A British military officer of the U.S. Navy Brigade, who participates in the defense of Maripol, told his friends and family that they would be armed and put in a field for Russian occupations.
Source: Twitter page by Eiden Eislin, a British who served in the US branch since 2018, the U.S.A. with family members and friends of Eislin, Atlas News with the word of his friend, who spoke with him
"We've been getting news from him for 48 days, we've tried everything we can to protect Mariupol, but we don't have a choice, except for the success of the Russian army.
We don't have food and weapons.
Thank you, everyone, I hope that the war will be over soon."
Details: Eislin served in the 36th special coastal bridge of the U.S. Navy, which participated in the defense operation of Mariupol.
The U.S. Journalists contacted the mother of the army officer Ann Wood, and she confirmed that on her son's phone, she told them they were planning to go to hell.
The second military officer, Brian Phillips, also confirmed to journalists that the last phone call by Aislin referred to the plans for their capitalization.
According to him, fighting and food were finished in Brigadiers.
The Atlas News journals contacted his friend who said that the Eislins were planning to give up in the fields to the Russians, so that they would not get caught without weapons and bullets into the hands of so-called "coding men."
Sommeyers also published audio recordings of a telephone talk that, like Eislin, speaks with his well - known American friend, who plans to go to Ukraine.
In his speech, Eiselin said that they were trying to get out of town in civil clothing, but they couldn’t.
Earlier, the British told him that Instagram was threatened by representatives of the private military company Wagner.
Eislin was a social worker in New York-on-Trent in Nottingemshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to participate in the fight against terrorists called the Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018, he officially entered the U.S.A. and took the oath.
Aislyna was known as Johnny’s friends and neighbors, and in the summer he was better known as the Cossack Gundi movie.
Please, I know it's hard for you, but I also want to know whether we're together or not.

My family's fine, I've got three brothers and a man.
One brother in the war in Mariupoli, the other in Zaporjia, and a man today moved from Kiev to Harkova.
They call every day saying everything's fine, and there's people who know it, they're never gonna tell the truth.
She wanted to come to you, but she wanted to do some things.
I'll ask the man tomorrow morning if he can get there tomorrow.
When you come home, write me, please, I need to talk to Daniel.
The attackers, for their loss in battle, were playing full.
They shot the teacher Dmitra Pavlic, who was unknown to his family, young Boris Oleksianka.
Their bodies are thrown into “the deep memory of the One who buried the earth.”
Remember, there was a dead silence in the city.
Soon, one of the residents of the village fled from the house to the house.
In the streets, the bodies of the wounded were always met
And I, maybe I'll go after you, you need me.
3. How can your own activity/activity help you or your friends better adapt to life in Chechnya?
But you won't come here because this is the construction of the rail road and the drive is closed.
Go to the bridge where the reconstruction is, tell me that they're gone and I'll come to you.

I want to be able to thank everyone who helped us because it was the last hope, the truth.
I'm not afraid of work, as I was living in the village, so I can and I love to work physically.
When You Can Bring Things
You're very interested in tradition, we're going to Christmas.
Last week, the Supreme Council welcomed draft law 7176, which has the name "To ensure the monitoring of potential threats to national security of Ukraine in the economic sphere".
It's amazing that the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the field of economics has been the location for which the members of the company and the bank are meeting.
Lawmakers believe that making a decision by the company’s supervisory board in the state of Kiev can somehow solve the problems of Ukraine’s national security.
We know of the number of new hazards to the company, but we still don't know about any company that had a physical need to hold a meeting on the location.
The potential threat of such a law has been understood as a wonderful basis for "get" all the achievements in the difficult post-Resurance reform, including independent supervisory advice, and then set up manual management.
That was until 2015.
Why is the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses interested in providing direction, and who should attend?
More than that, if under Patriotic Gas "flys" one harmful bill, others can fly tomorrow, for example, through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
Much can be written about war.
In fact, this initiative has continued until the beginning of war and legislation 7176.
Thus, on 22 February, this rule was introduced to the corresponding table of Bill 5397.
And in general, the desire to abandon the supervisory board in one way or another has been around some of the national prejudices for a long time.
Not because of criticism like that, but to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will consider the arguments that were clarified on the need for it to be accepted.
And then let's give our proposals how to solve the issue of antisocial governance during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Dennis Qudin explained the need for such innovation to risk losing the Internet and other means of linking away from the work of the surveillance councils.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board can't make the necessary decisions, as far as the company's work can be parallelized.
We agree that this is a risk, but would it be possible to prevent it from being transferred to Ukraine by members of the Governing Body?
Let's imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of the supervisory board (most of the whole company) put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, they can be released under the bill.
And, more quickly, this will lead to the loss of the quorum needed to take care of any decision.
Instead, it will not quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, as the law foresees the need for a competitive team that lasts for 3-4 months.
Thus, proposed by Bill 7176, the decision will not be able to prevent the loss of the ability to make decisions, but rather, it will result in a better outcome!
The national parliament, the author of the Dmitro Nataluch project, gives other arguments for his support.
In particular, he notes: "Many companies, especially the defense-trade complex (OPC), now need relocating" and therefore "it's hard to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information from Zoom's Day."
At first, in Ukraine, there are almost no OPCs that have oversightal advice.
The supervisory board is a bug in the Ucroboronprome, which actually controls almost all OPC's claims.
But even in the Ucroboronprome, according to the law, the supervisory board has a very limited performance, and all its members do their duties on a non-free basis.
All the authorities in the "Croborons" belong to the Director-General, who will decide on the need to relocate the OPC or other company that belongs to the composition of the concert.
Moreover, this argument does not support criticism, and the fact that draft 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation governing the activities of the OPCA.
Mr. Dmitro on his Facebook page also provides arguments that can lead to the category "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with increasing the efficiency of companies and banks, but let's try to figure out some of them, and let's say, "the real experts of the first word "war" still remain in Ukraine in 2021, but are left with members of the state-run councils in Ukraine with a full salary of hundreds of thousands of dollars, while Ukraine itself is actually suffering from war."
First of all, it's manipulation - most of these members of the supervisory board never lived in Ukraine and only came here periodically.
So to say that they're "remaining Ukraine," in a soft way, unjust.
Secondly, as a result of the pandemic of the Coronavirus, both foreign and Ukrainian observers have long been involved in the practice of online meetings.
This tool has long been widely used in world practice, which has led to a wide variety of areas: business, education, medicine, and so forth.
Nor should you forget that membership in the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, these people have another occupation, and now the means of electronic communication help them in this.
Thirdly, all of these statements are read as claims only to foreigners.
Interestingly, why does Mr. Dmitro not present the same claims to members of the supervisory board who are thieves?
Because they don't even know where their companies are.
In fact, this is not the first populist attempt to get foreigners out of custody, and war is just a new opportunity.
Hi, I'm in Ukraine, looking for a possible option for a temporary pregnancy in the family, with me two children.

We usually need the passport of one of the adults
In the Brovars, the Highlands, and the Buchanan regions of the Kiev area, which were set free from the occupations, there is a 2 - hour period of command.
Paul spoke directly: "In the settlements of the Brovary, the Highlands and the Buchanan regions, which were under Russian occupation and were released by the Ukrainian defence forces, the Commandant hour was reinforced!
In the territory of these cities and the border forces will operate from 21:00 2 April to 06:00 5 April".
Details: According to the head of the wave, at this time it is categorically forbidden to stay on the streets of settlements and other public places, transport and sand.
The residents can walk out the street only during the alarm signal to get to the shelter.
Such restrictions have been imposed in order to obtain the consequences of the Russian aggression — to clean up and divide the territory.
Omelanuk invited people who had left these areas before they were able to stay home.
The remainder of the command year will last from 21:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.

The Serbian defence budget has grown steadily for a few years.
In total, for the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in modernization of the army, the renewal of military technology, and the acquisition of modern systems, 22 of which are listed by the world’s most powerful military powers.
After a full campaign against Ukraine, the Western countries were strongly opposed to the prospect of a possible rise in the Balkans.
For Ukraine this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukraine conflict is complex and globalized.

The Lukaschenka regime was held by three Belarusians 27 and 28 years old, who were involved in the destruction of the two releasing headquarters under the Osipowica, which provides the movement of railways.
Source: Radio Freedom, Public Security Centre, Head of the Criminal militia of the IRS Gennadi Kazakevich, quoted by BelTA.
In Belarus, the IMS reported that three residents of Bobruís were detained on the night of March 30 for the strong support of the UN Specialists, one injured.
According to the Clear data, the arrest men were actively opposed and tried to escape.
The security forces used the weapon.
One of the prisoners was injured and lived in a hospital.
Others received medical help at the site.
IMS Chief of Criminal Police Bilorsi Gennadi Kazakevich stated that "the acts of terrorism on the RB railway will be severely halted" with the use of weapons.
On 6 April, it became known that on 30 March the police had detained another Balourian railway worker, Baranovic's partner "BJD" and the theme resource manager "BJD" in "VContaktia" and "On-class" Valentina Samasuka.
Where he is now, and in what state he is unknown, reports @belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railways were stopped in Belarus.
We remember: The formation of BYPOL, announced by Lukaschenka extremist mode, continues to call on Belarus to make a difference in rail transport and Belarus infrastructure under the "Help" plan.
The Belarusian "reicants" are thus attempting to counter the Russian aggression against Ukraine.
It is known that because of Belarus, the U.S.R. is changing to fight in Ukraine, there is power and technology.
It's for self-assessment.

U.S. banned investment in the RF and imposed sanctions on Putin's daughter
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, impose new sanctions on President Putin's daughter, the largest banks of the RF Alpha Bank and Sberbank, as well as prohibiting all new investments in Russia.
This is reported on on the White House website.
Sberbank is Russia's largest financial institution, which is owned by the government, and Alpha Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the US financial system and prevent US citizens from carrying business with them.
In addition, the States are making a full ban on new investments in the IMF.
In this regard, U.S. President Joe Byden will sign a new order, which includes a ban on new investment in Russia by citizens of the United States regardless of their location.
"This step is based on a decision taken by more than 600 transnational companies to leave Russia.
The private sector's exit includes producers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions and other service providers such as legal and advisory companies," says the White House.
Thirdly, new sanctions from the United States have been imposed against major Russian state enterprises in the critical area.
This will prevent US citizens from carrying out operations with these organizations and freeze any assets they have in the jurisdiction of the States.
The detailed list of Minfin will be updated on the next day at 4:00.
And the last part of the package is the full blockade of the assets of Putin, the wife and daughters of Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lavrov, as well as the members of the Russian Security Council, including the president and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Michael Moussin.
The sanctions remove them from the U.S. financial system and freeze all the assets they have in the United States.

You can call the school, Kira doesn't take the phone, doesn't answer, I don't know if she's gone to school.
They isolate the Russian office: they stop investments and stop supplying.
But we didn't understand.
In our house, there was no military service.
Our house is next to the military unit and the oil tank
He just helped me because I wouldn't make it myself.
I'm so ready, I'm not asking for a drink, and I'm giving you some good advice.
I'll take care of it.
It's a little hard for me, but I understand I have to go through this stage.
We'll meet you at 4:00, and we'll tell you everything.
It's all right.
game as often as you get home
I pick up every week.
I'm sorry, there's no programs, but I'm trying to break up.
I Dreamed of Being a Teacher
My girls can't go anywhere right now, so I didn't write the owner of the house.
She wanted to ask you that if you'd hear about living information, you'd let me know.
I would be happy to have a living with a proper girl.
If you might know that, let me know.
On my side, I'm not a clue.
Thank you always.
You haven't written another person at 54 years of age. Please write the exact address and how many courses are cost.
I think it's best for you to make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
So I didn't change it, it's one of my births:)
I'm sorry I didn't see it.
We're going to the Medical Committee now.
That's why Ani should work this hour on another day.
What day is it better to come before? (maybe the day you work a little more?)
I'll hear you tomorrow, it's a bad job on the Internet.
You're lucky you're gonna do it.
Thank you.. they found something, but there was nothing from technology.
Both beginners, but we don't know anything
Nothing's happening.
May I see you on Monday 25.04.?
You can take the kids with you, the game here is enough :)
I thought about my father.
I'm probably very wealthy or very loved, but I'm thinking about this money.
We'll do it somewhere.
But as it will be paid, please, no credit.
Write me straight, and I'll help you.
We're your partner, or I'm not your partner.
I don't know.
Should I take with me those bags that you gave me?
Today is not my day.
Something came from you. I don't see what you're doing.
I'm sorry too.
I remind you of the fact that you're late
Do you have only a father who speaks and understands Russian?
On what day does a fellow worker want to build a house, and how many houses do the house have windows?
I'm ashamed to get you out of your business.
Good evening, I can't share it with you.
I'm glad to respect Joe Dispensus, he's doing research on the impact of external factors and the formation of new neurons.
Natalya Nagorna's television journalist "1+1" broadcast a video on the morning of 12 April, which was delivered to her by the 36th military bridge of the Sea of Mariupol.
The soldiers say they have no weapons left to share in the wars and the wars of the wounded.
They said, "The account's going in an hour."
Earlier, on April 11, 36, in particular the Bridge of the Sea of the Sea, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, had issued a petition to the Koreans in Russian.
It was reported that on 11 April it could be the last fight for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Korean military command was not linked to the wares for two weeks.
Sceptres were said to have been published in Russian.
The Chief Commander of the Defence Forces of Ukraine, Valerie Prison, assured that the connection of the command with the defence forces in Mariupoli is not to be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block the Ukrainian fighters on the Austal Territory in Mariupoli and use them with chemical weapons.
On the evening of April 11th, the Russian occupations took place in Mariupol with a devastating element of unknown origin.
As told by the leader "Azova" by Andrei White, the RF Army used a chemical weapon against the Austal facility, which holds the battle line "Azov".
Thank you, I'll be ready for you.
The situation and itself until we stay here.
2 hours drive )) vacations, mom in stores and back)!
It doesn't matter.
She forgot what she's doing here.
Escadrylius of the Czech drones has since begun flying over Ukraine.
Nearly 50 professional computers will be used for detection, but one of them will be for direct destruction of the enemy treasurer.
Two Croatian brothers and two Czech brothers were sent to Ukraine shortly thereafter, thanks to the MP of the Mukachev village of Volodymir Labuttenka.
Today, they have been given the honor of being the leader of a community council and coordinator of https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasilem Turum, who have received special assignments from the Ukrainian army in various cities where war is ongoing.
With the maximum effective and safe use of computers, we'll keep them out of the darkness right now.
Four of the friends who help the Ukrainian army from Czechia to stop planning to stop, say that the next few days to Ukraine will send many more interesting gifts, which will serve the destruction of the Russian occupation and the preservation of the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I don't like sweet, but I can do without it.
I'm worried we won't make it.
I'll be back to Ukraine soon, continue to work
All right, if it's all right, I'll agree.
I'm trying myself, but if there's any problems I'll write to you if I can?
A Key to Understanding One Another
We were personally in the old lady of the village of Eve, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that life was empty
Maybe she'll betray her, and she'll get up early.
Today, I was remodeled.
And I think I'm still on the street today.
I've been drinking drugs and tea, feeling worse, but not critical.
I'm sorry, too, but I'd better meet when I'm healthy.
When you have time, take out the music you like.
I'm curious about what you've got to do with music.
Mom and Dad Need to Listen
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's bike.
It's colder and rain today, and it's gonna be hot tomorrow.
But no damage to destroyed houses, no damage to the people who are about to be destroyed
In Herson, the appellants were introduced to the memorial of the "Salava Ukraine" in Herson on the streets of Perkopsky.
Details: It is noted that the proposal of the European Union has been rejected, destroyed, and destroyed in the Russian-Ukraine war with photographs of the sky.
The appellants watched the portraits of the heroes of Heaven's hundreds and the missing participants in the Russian-Ukraine War.
They've had a stroke.
Good morning, thanks to the kids on the couch, we don't have a habit like this, so we didn't know, gave the kids only chocolate and butter, maybe something else needed to be done.
There's someone in the Czech Republic who can talk if that's what I'm saying.
Because I live the guy in the shop until twelve people are here and then they go to work.
Hey, it's a little better.
Today he was in exile.
Even today he's sleeping there.
So we've already made great progress.
I'm obliged to bring the hostages together!
I don't have the power to do them today
Since I'm staying away from the days and times when I'm working for a room after the guests, I can say about a month's flower, because I already have an approximate room pickup schedule.
In May, I can say about it at the end of May or at the beginning of May.
I'm just wondering if you have something to say about it.
I'm sorry she didn't have a long record of cooking dinner and a little sleep
If you don't mind, could I come today?)
or I'll meet you after your arrival.)
He's a humble man, he's learned a lot lately, and he realizes that he needs it very much in his life.
( Hi.) Everything went very well.
I was a little surprised at working with people on such a high position.
Today, there is a lesson to be learned from a lady who is the director of the Economics Department of the Highlands.
She was very pleased with my work.
It's a mistake I've behaved well.
On Monday, I have to make a confirmation of my work as well as the cash payment for the rent.
I'm late on Friday.
I don't do anything just a lot of them and sleep. (and drink a lot of water )
If you go to the doctor tomorrow, I'll go with you if you can.
I've got another analysis.
And then you won't have to walk again.
It's very bad looking, it's bad luck, it's bad luck.
That's how it's all there.
Can you send me the correct e-mail address?
I want to send you an invitation to a course in the Czech language you have written on.
And do the children get there, or should they bring it with them?
And now there's one question to ask you for a moment.
When Help Is Needed
If I'm not wrong, you celebrate the Passover today, right?
At first, we didn't want you to collect money so people don't think we're looking for it!
But I didn't have two points to fill online:
I'm going to have to rest, get strength and energy, thank you for the present gift.
It'll be fine, because the whole family's going to paint.
The Karasin University invites employees and students to carefully check any information, not trust anonymous sources in the media and social networks, hearings and platforms.
Focus only on official information.
That's how you can count on me, thank you!
my other brother who remained in Ukraine also helps the army
She's got some work for the portfolio.
After the world, they have to go online.
I'd like to be your backup designer.
How I miss the day I wasn't at work is a passerby
Stéta: Russia is preparing a prosecution in the Pridnis River to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army may be prosecuted in the Baltic Sea region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of "in aggression against the neighbouring state".
"It is not excluded from the armed forces of the Russian Federation of provocations in the territory of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against the neighbouring state."
Details: The opponent continues to create a subsequent team of troops for action in the Slovak direction.
Likely, in the near future, the tenants will try to resume their progress.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and send personal supplies, equipment, and equipment for military operations in Ukraine.
The preparation of armed and military technology is being carried out at the point of permanent dislocation of the 60th single motorcycle Brigade (Monistry) of the 5th General Army of the East Army.
The designated weapon will probably be moved to the area of the South.
To recover the loss of the private component of the Battalion Tactical Group from the 36th single motorcycle Brigades (Borzia, Zabikalsk district) 29 General army members of the East Army are being deployed from the designated Brigade.
The enemy's particular problem is the integration of the crew of drivers and mechanics.
The proceeds of the selected private warehouse from the point of permanent disposal are scheduled for the second half of this year.
Likely, the opponent to disrupt the supply of troops to the war scene continues to attack transport infrastructure in Ukraine with the aim of destroying them or putting them out of the ship.
The armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out the tasks of strengthening the protection of the Ukrainian-Blood Border in the Brest and the Gomel region.
On the Slojanan route, the formation of the 6th General Army and the coastal northern army continue to block the city of Harkov, and the artillery attacks continue in individual areas of the city.
In the Isiomian Way, air exploration is being carried out with the aim of identifying the position of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
That's why the opponent applies the Orlan-10 BPLA.
The forces of two Battalion tactical groups tried to make progress in the direction of Dovgenjka and Dmitrovka settlement, but they failed to succeed and went to a previously occupied position.
In the Southern Hemisphere, the opposition continues to focus on the occupations under the control of Popasna, Rubižne, the Netherlands, and Novobahmutka, as well as the establishment of full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to get the gold - mining work done in the area, but he failed.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aerosols, the occupations continue to exert pressure in the areas of the Austral and the port of the sea.
The strengths of the enemy's individual generation have led to artillery attacks on the position of the Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlement of the Highlands, the Labour Force and the Maryansk.
In the territory of the South and the Lugan region, Ukraine's defenders in the past suffered four enemy attacks, five tanks were destroyed, eight units of armored, six units of car technology and eight enemy artillery systems.
Didn't you get your thoughts?
Of course we're trying to make it, but I'm afraid
And you can sleep and I'll keep you
You don't mind if I come?
Maybe you just don't want to see today, so tell me, I get it.
Thank you. We didn't even watch TV at home and then more than 1+1. We don't need to set up :)
I'm going to include the TV here exclusively to listen to the language of the Czechs.
I've finished my tariff package today :)
Can we do this on the phone today?
Buy fabric for lifting, riding, jumping nets
I understand that I can prepare materials in this area.
I'm a little embarrassed to ask her, and she gives us so many pirates.
We'll meet my father later.
I've read the statement in the Facebook page, which is probably Google something by my writer. I think the phone number is enough.
Good day, we've got the things you brought, but are there things that we can bring in 10 minutes?
I was thinking about getting a job.
If Mr. Director adjusts, I can start working from next week because tomorrow I plan to go to the office to submit documents (if you get them because they're very big) and on Saturday rain:)
I'm looking for a brigade at the beginning, I really liked chemistry school, I'm learning something language to know, I'm dreaming of working on you
Friends of old and not very much, friends with whom I do not know personally, friends of the spirit and the mind.
Now you've been through a lot of difficult times.
For the last month, I've been in contact with a lot of you.
Your life, which was never easy, turned from foot to head, as was the life of every prostitute.
Many of you are fleeing from Russia.
And many of you have learned to be forgiving and to be ashamed of your country’s actions toward your neighbors.
That's why they're giving Ukraine your name.
Some of you, activists, have been in danger for a long time, and you've been preparing for a decisive attack.
At the beginning of March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from the Memorial.
I'll tell you a little later, - as usual, Sasha answered with a lacony reply. - Now we're going to the ruins after the search.
Others — artists, critics, writers — are affected by the sudden collapse of your tiny world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be clear: except for a very few of you -- those who worked in the Memorial, in the New newspaper, in the Eho Moscow, in the Medus, in the Naval Organization and elsewhere -- did many of you want to do anything against this regime?
In addition to the fact that they were in the fields when they were still in the field.
Also read the Russian newspaper column "After hiding, after talking"
And if so, are you sure that your feelings of shame and guilt are not just abstractions?
Perhaps they have been called upon by your long - suffering concern for what is going on around you, your apathy, and your passive cooperation, which are now likely to be a major challenge in your mind and heart?
That's not always the case.
In 1990 it was a short period when you had to a certain extent freedom and democracy, not even blood, but real.
But 1991 did not appear to be better than 1917.
Why, every time you finally have a revolution, do you end up with such a deep fear that you're looking for salvation behind the king, let his name be Stalin or Putin?
As long as he didn't kill people, you all seem to be safer with him.
True, mistakes were made.
Instead of grabbing and swallowing the KBB archives, as the Germans did from the stage, you took the soul to the memory of the Georgian – and allowed the KB to rely on the bottom, update, transform and capture power over the country.
When you were set before the civil war and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option, and you humbly agreed with the genocide.
In 1998, your economy fell, and it called the end of massive struggles for great social justice or war in Chechnya.
The main concern was salvation.
And then Putin, a young, entrepreneurial, aggressive, promised to settle with the terrorists and raise the economy.
A few of you have bought it, but you have all voted for one or more of it, or you have given the preference not to vote at all.
When he began to compare Chechnya again with the earth, most of you were in danger of that.
I remember those years well.
I was working in Chechnya right away, helping the victims of the road's anti-terrorist operation, and I saw the ruins of Grozny, Qatar City, Itum Cali and other cities.
Sometimes on my way back to Moscow, I was happy to meet you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and in time I tried to tell you about the fear I witnessed: the tortures of peaceful people, the killings of children, the soldiers who sold their dead bodies to their families.
And you said to me, "Well, we've already got your check." I remember these words very well.
And I said, "Dear, it's not my Chechnya, it's your Chechnya.
It's your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just an idiot.
It's your government that bombs one of your cities, kills your fellow citizens."
But no, it was too difficult, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic pace of the zeros, said to increase oil prices and Putin's willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that some of the stolen money will remain in the middle class pockets.
Many of you have become well - off, some rich, and even the poorest of you have acquired a new home and found a better job.
Prices grew, and is it poor?
Moscows were sacredly carved and carved out of the rock.
When several opposers — Yuria Chechnya, Anna Politków, Oleksandra Litvinenka and others — were killed, many of you were shocked and were afraid of what was going on.
However, the case did not go on.
When Putin handed over President Medvedev's post after two terms, and he took over the office of the Prime Minister, you see, it was easy to pay attention to this.
When a few months later, when the government of the Mediterranean Russia invaded Georgia, most of you were ignored or tortured.
How many of you have I met in the next few years on the mountain slopes of Gudouri, in the front yards of Kazbage or in the coffee and Turkish pools of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that either we did a lot in the West if they did anything at all.
A little confusion, a little sanctions; but what was meant by the fact that Russia is more critically violating international law when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas and the internal market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the difficult 1990s, it was the most important thing.
By the end of 2011, however, my Russian friends had disappeared.
When Putin relocated with the Medvedi and took the presidential chair, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you went out to protest.
The name of the Naval has become proficient, you haven't gone out of the street for a year, and the regime has finally felt fearful that the ground is losing its feet.
After that, he struck the answer.
At first, alternative action was organized, then more oppressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands of people were trapped behind bars.
Some have received a great deal of terms.
"And what could we do?"
I've heard it so often and still hear it.
"It's so strong, and we're so weak."
Well, look at the Koreans.
Consider what they did two years ago.
Exposed by the proselytism president who betrayed their European hopes, they once captured Maydan — and never abandoned him.
They took the city itself into their own hands and prepared for decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy him, they began to protect him by means of the fires, ammunition, and Molotov cocktails.
Finally, the police opened fire.
But instead of running, the protesters went into the attack.
Many have died, but they have won.
As a fugitive, Janukovich, and the Ukrainians returned to democracy, the right to choose the leaders themselves and to expel them if they do wrong.
Mydan didn't really like Putin.
That was a bad example.
So when he used the general sensitivities, he caught Crimea.
Some of you were opposed, but you benefited from it a little.
And how many of you were trapped!
As far as I know, 91% of Russia's citizens supported the anecdotes.
From the moment the new myth was born, and many of you who hated Putin and his hat suddenly returned to 180 degrees and began to worship him.
I find it difficult to find a reason, as soon after that, we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who stayed with my friends were mostly silent.
"We don't care about politics," you said.
And you're hiding a new one in books, movies, IKEA catalogues and parks, almost as new as after the restoration that Moscow started in 2012, with their foreign neighbors, the general wafa and the hipster coffee.
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful – and it's just getting better.
You have recently turned your attention to Syria.
There were terrorists there, right?
THE idea that even the Moscow editor who released my book on Syria was critical of her in the interview, because I probably didn't understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw for myself how on the streets of Homs the government were shooting coldly at my children.
Among all the citizens of Russia, there were only your soldiers who started bombing thousands of peaceful people in 2015 obtaining experience for the next major war.
Of course, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Niemeller:
"First they came to socialists, but I spoke because I'm not socialist.
Then they came to the professor’s office, but I spoke because I was not a professor.
Then they came to the Jews, but I spoke to them because I was not a Jew.
Then they came after me, but there was no one else who could say anything about my protection."
How many of you were told about Chechens, Syrians, or Koreans?
Some of you did.
But most of them spoke.
Some actually speak now — such as Dmitro Gluhowski, Michelo Shiskin, Michelo Zigar, Maxim Osipov, and others.
Most allow themselves to speak out of the border, some from the middle of the country, such as Marina Ossennikova, risking getting into a new GULAG or to classify a New Company.
As far as others are concerned, you know the best country in which you live.
So, I'm sure you understand, when Putin comes in with the kidnappers, or what seems very likely if he doesn't get it, he'll take it for you.
For all of you, my friends, for those who are brave, but most of the ones who have gone out to protest, and have yet a little term, but soon it gets more serious.
Thousands of you have signed a petition that expressed an objection to the churches (even a black square in the Instagram) or expressed in private conversations with colleagues at work.
Sometimes, when 10 or even 25 years of free will were given just for the anecdotes, they did not remain in such a distant past — and now, with great likelihood, they are waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you, and who will be left?
The example of Koreans – even more than 2014 – fears the pathic regime: they show that they can fight it.
And what the mind, motivation, and kindness can stop him, which the bully would not have been on the paper of his preference.
In view of all of this, few in Russia realize this as well as what the war is all about.
But you, my friends, know what's going on right now.
You're reading foreign news online, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you support ties.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be ready.
You know what it's all about.
Good life in exchange for your speech has finally come to an end.
Your choices are simply hohm, your laws, if you don't pay attention to the pressure, are worth nothing more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media no more, your economy is ruining faster than I write, you don't have credit cards to buy tickets on the plane over the border, even if there's still some rice left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will require your agreement, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can try or go somewhere, or you'll be disappointed.
I doubt you'll see another option.
Still, there is one more.
Which ends up breaking this regime.
And maybe under the circumstances that you have been raised, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The ice will not melt away from you: because of the economic collapse that is taking place in Russia, it is most likely to burn in the province, in small cities.
When prices go up and no payments are paid, those who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will go to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, my friends.
But if each city goes out on its own, as it has been periodically, it will not be difficult for them to be separated.
Organization and coordination will be required. The crowd will need to be converted to the mass.
You have this wonderful magic tool -- the Internet that can limit the mode, but which still works and which can be adjusted in almost any way.
The Naval Organization has been expanded, but it can create other, more informal, more decentralised.
You're a lot, millions of you.
The Moscow police can strike with 30,000 people in the streets of the city, possibly hundreds of thousands.
If it goes out over 300 thousand, it'll be crushed.
The army will have to be used, but will it fight for Putin when it comes to business?
After all, why did he have them in Ukraine, all because he had to go through them?
Of course, the danger will be great.
Many of you will be afraid of them. Those who have children will fear them.
And that's natural, that's normal.
I'd be afraid in your place too.
For example, in Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happened to those who were being accused of neglecting their master, who was being forced not only to demand freedom but who really tried to get it.
But even if you don't do anything, the lives of countless people will all be lost.
Your son will end up playing a game in a computer game – and he will be arrested; your daughter will testify to online harassment – and he will be arrested; your close friend will admit mistakes – and he will die in a serial camera under police gates.
This is what has been happening for many years — and will continue to be strengthened by gaining greater and greater levels.
So you don't have a choice, and if you don't do anything, you know what's going to happen.
Do it colderly, think strategically, and achieve it.
We were on Friday at work, told us we could come on Monday.
We'll be home at night.
What You Think of Me as a Secretary
Hey, man, how often do you go to dinner in the street restaurant?
Once on a date, I'm sleeping for dinner in a street restaurant.
(I'm trying to explain everything to her)
So we liked it very well, and we wanted something more, so it's a better option.
She lived in a place where there were many people, and she got tired of her energy.
I feel bad, cough, temperature, loss of voice, weakness and headaches
I have to go to the government
We've already done this, but we've been told who's registered in the flower money just at the end of the month.
We'll go with the kids to the doctor.
But last night I wrote a lady who liked your work, and she wanted something from you in her house.
I'm waiting for new news from her, and I'm on duty.
When I worked at the university, I thought I was building a career, spending a lot of time and energy.
I had a hard psychological, responsible, mental work that I was completely disappointed.
It's a waste of time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I have been able to communicate, but marriage is also a matter of serious concern.
There was one man I had to marry, but he died, problems with the heart.
I think that to create a family, people must love, respect, trust one another.
Now, I didn't see that.
Good morning. Where can you get forms to celebrate Christmas (paper or silicon)?
All right, thanks for the advice, then I'm going to bring a witness to Vala right now.
She's got a CDP in her bed state, she's now down in her hips, her leg in her bed, she's getting all over her blender.
Mr. Richard, I'm sorry I'm worried about you at work.
But I have an important question for you.
I went to the playroom to Natalia today to say hello to her.
The situation was unpleasant for her.
Because when the children went home, one mother refused to take the child because she said she came to see things and put them in that room with the clothes and Mr. Valerie opened our baby room until 7:00 a.m.
Is that really possible?
Worktime room up to 16:00.
And finally it's our responsibility.
But I don't have any goods. It doesn't open a very weak web page.
Good morning, we're all fine.) The car works, yesterday, the invitations were filled, and I worked with the elders before the exam in the gym.
It's hard to figure out how to get rid of geometry.
On Saturday, Volodymir helped us.
She studies universities and high school programs.
Can we pay for the room and the wf?
Thank you so much for your life.
Yeah, but I thought you didn't fill up.
We're trying to get the maximum amount by the end of the week to calculate
Situation of Russia's invasion - Brifing Chief of the Office of President Oleksia Arestovic (10.04.2022)
The director of the president's office told of the hero's actions by the senior military officer in Mariupoli -- he was shot and wounded, so he broke up with the radio station so she didn't get into an enemy.
I have a very important question, will they help me put my 5-year-old (bronchial asthma) on her face and throat...
We need a family doctor who will understand a little Ukrainian or Russian.
For a while, we need the doctor's advice very much about her condition.
We're living in Chechia Dolní Chabry. We need a doctor who's both here in Dolní Chabry or somewhere else possible Bronno but not far from the metro so we can get there.
The exhibit was very interesting.
Metlers sat with the children on their hands and feet.
How's your day?
O Lord, I am so grateful to you for the word of your Lord that I am very grateful for the power which he has given you.
Mom's been there since 4 o'clock.
Perhaps the gentleman will leave his phone for communication.
I've been thinking of the best option for this house in Prague-8.
The director told me nothing about the possibility of sponsoring a child’s diet.
I've been given such information to pay.
In March and in the summer, I was already paying for food.
If you had a chance to help me pay the fine and the red?
