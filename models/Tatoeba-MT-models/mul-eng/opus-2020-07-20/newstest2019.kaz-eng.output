First of all, I don't mind.
If we say 2200 years, then we're the same thing, let's start with that.
But it needs to be proven, called "N.A.B.B.
Let's go again, today's president of the CR has identified the precise instructions for respecting the city of Shmkent.
There are rules against black archeology.
After the Black Archaeologists, the alarmers are in a public state.
On this subject, Mühamedi, Minister of Education and Sports, was informed about the project "The Protection and Use of History-based Objects" in Mexico.
History requires re-examination of archaeological, restorational work carried out on objects.
It's not safe for any of our alarms or unexploded objects to be found by black archaeologists, and then they're either in public or in full.
On the other hand, history-based construction works that are being carried out in areas that have access to historical and cultural heritage have also been carried out with remarkable effects on the history and preservation of cultural and cultural warnings, and also on the conditions that have led to the struggle for peace.
In addition, it is not necessary to improve the conditions that require a precise order in the field of rights, and to improve the conditions for the protection and use of historical objects.
In view of his statement, it is now considered to identify and account the historical and historical objects at the legislative level, as well as to establish their monitoring procedures, to preserve the history of the historical objects, and to introduce new methods of use.
In addition, it is proposed to perform archaeological works and to establish rules and conditions against "black archeology", to establish the right of land use in protected areas, to organize the construction of historical and cultural warnings, to determine the right of use of natural landscapes.
In the process of drafting a bill, a national experiment has been examined.
For example, Russia's law introduces laws against illegal archaeological research, the accumulation of archaeological materials, the transfer of artifacts to the state, and other forms of resistance to "black archeology".
I mean, scientific responsibility has been examined.
In Italy, there are legal criteria for private collections.
They consider creating a list of historical and more interesting and personal subjects and updating them with time.
Also, despite the fact that these objects are named, even though they are small, the objects in their babies can be stately protected, says A. Mayhamedi.
We've been working on a 10-year-old festival that's going to take place.
As a result of our association with the border guards in the country, it is reported that the international event is going to be called the "Question Year".
From 10 countries, everyone has had a lot of hope.
It's 35 from the border, the rest from our own country.
France, Afghanistan, Turkey, Iran and other countries will be tested.
There are three directions: a variety of hand tools, a visualization of interpreters, and a wide range of interpretations.
It's a talk show that's coming through every year.
The goal here is to add the beginning of our borders, and then multiply our cultural heritage together.
We decided that we'd go in the way of Elorda.
In the next year, let's go through a regional festival in all the colors of our country, and choose the holiday from it.
We'll be planning a joint festival in Astana at the end of the year, says Astana and the head of the Akamola District Office of the World Cup.
The organizers say it's important that we develop relationships with each other on the border.
And the unit's special -- the first time it's been transferred to Astana.
The total population of international warming is 3 million.
The World Cup will be held on the 7th anniversary of the "Victory and Agreement" in the context of the "Otandas" series.
The Assistant is the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As we've already told you, there's been a lot of border crossings in Astana today.
College heads are cheating on land and property.
The East Kazakhstan District prosecutor is looking at college services in the editors' office and discovers many of the illegalities of law, as well as the unintended budgetary implications.
In other words, in the course of the state job, there was a lack of competitive imagery, false education of students, illegal graffiti, failure to meet the educational requirements of teachers, lack of access to schools, and lack of access to public membership.
There is often a lack of information about the number of jobs involved, such as how to make more money, and how to make more money, and how to do so.
In spite of the fact that students from other countries did not have access to their classrooms, the Department of Education gave grants to the Semay City Business and Service College, the city of Ayagaz, and to two colleges in the city of Väske every year.
College administrations set out out to bring out the third-party departments to the public office for municipal services that were agreed to be held at the student's place of residence.
I had 12 students in my college who were lying.
Teachers and academics in the course of their studies, in theoretical and practical study journals, paid attention to these students, and sent them to exchange courses.
In addition, the total amount of the hall allocated to these students was 8 million.
That's what we're doing before the trial.
In the college field, there are also factors of illegal use for private purposes.
For example, public events have been more expensive in the field of Eastern Kazakhstan, known as Abdullins.
After the prosecutor's proposal has been entered, it is planned to close the car and replace it with a sport plan.
According to the results of the investigation, the prosecutors identified a room of 43 million.
According to the monitoring activities, 36 million is equal to today.
The regular responsibility is 60, the administrative responsibility is four.
