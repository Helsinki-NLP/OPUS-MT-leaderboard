The white foot on f3, the black foot on e6, the white foot on g4, the black face on h4 - mat! In the square circle it is called the narrow mat.
White: yellow on a1, b6 on b6, king on c8. Black: black on a7 and b7, king on a8, blue on b8. White on yellow is the opposite of a6, and then only two variants remain in black: take a6 or move the yellow on any other field of diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, whites move the foot with b6 on b7 and place the mat. In the second case, the white layer takes the black on a7 with the same result.
