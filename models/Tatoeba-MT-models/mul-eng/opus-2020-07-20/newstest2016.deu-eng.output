Obama received Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly.
They wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and the destabilising measures in the Middle East.
However, it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-State solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been strained for years.
Washington criticizes Israel's ongoing settlement structure and promotes the lack of desires in the peace process.
Through the deal that Obama has purchased about the Iranian nuclear programme, the relationship between the two has deteriorated further.
In March Netanyahu held a controversial debate at the invitation of the Republicans before the US Congress, which was partly assessed as a confrontation against Obama.
The speech was not spoken to Obama, and a meeting with reference to the previous election in Israel had been postponed.
In an emergency, Professor is trying to shoot his friend
Professor Shannon Lamb, in a nottuff, told the police that he had shot his friend and that the officers had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to stress that his "six dog" was still alive and probably ready, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, the officers found Amy Prentiss' body and a written note that was critical of a white block: "I was so sorry, I wanted to make it backward, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." This stood by the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who, in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already been teaching 300 miles to the school country, where he had shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police chief Lynn Buford said university employees had heard the shooting at 10:18 p.m.
He said that the Lamb once made the binding notref.
Until the end of the day, another death occurred: Lamm took his life when the police stopped him.
One day after the shooting at the university, the students and teachers were forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to get a picture of what prompted Lamb.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who could see, helped him draw a picture of a talented but perhaps difficult teacher.
The students said they enjoyed his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with which he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, which includes 17 members of the teacher's body, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there were some reports of problem behavior.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised the Lamb, said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, said that Lamm told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously prayed to the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had a health problem.
In this year, he taught only two online courses.
The latest changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the promotion, which had worked so hard for the Lamb, would not provide him with an automatic guarantee for an appointment as assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lambs' proposal."
These are questions that the Lamb can no longer answer.
After the flight from the campus, the police later found Lambs Spur when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house in the town of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still in the driveway.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamm went to this house, but Johnson said she thought he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the University, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogical.
He promoted in Pedagogic in the spring.
One of the longtime friends Lambs called him intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when she met with friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cooler guy who tried to bring you the guitar game for years.
He was the woman's screen at the time.
All the girls are swimming there when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and in the Jackson City of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously a few times together.
In the Notref, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no warrant for a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the backstein house, which bordered on a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but friends remained and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was completely destroyed on the ground," said O'Steen about her daughter.
You and your mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he had never met Lamb, but his daughter Abigail had heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentis, when he and Abigail appeared on a summer market three years ago.
Later they played together one or the other gig.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weak-lighted bar near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night last night 5 September, after the Lamb had finished his guitar and Mundharmonics game before a spree audience.
There were no signs that something was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were in the room, and we were in love with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American urban and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and of the Student Committee.
On Tuesday evening at Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people, including teachers, employees, students and members of the community, participated in a Christmas party.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the mahn-wave, while the university music "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
The instruction will be repeated in the middle of the week.
"We're trying to move our students back," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contribute to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamb in his Notuf Prentiss, although it is not known that they have ever married.
Toys R Us plant to set less labour force for Christmas
Toys R Us says that there are not as many Christmas season workers as in the last year, but the toys and baby products dealer says he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it was planned to place 40,000 people in countries and distribution centres throughout the country. In the spring of 2014, 45,000 workers were still employed.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it would start with applications this month and the number of employees increased from October to December.
While the holiday days are even months away, the Christmas business is closer, and companies are ready to set up temporary workers to allow beds with employees to be sold, sent and delivered products.
Michael J. Fox talks about his "date" with Princess Diana
The prize of "Back to the Future" was professionally a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also noted for personal reasons.
"We are in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the sitting next to me is empty, and I will be quite clear that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for a leading documentary film "Back in Time".
The film begins, and it makes me feel that I am a simulated gesture and an arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentary on "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with Director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" was 30 years ago Premier.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "incontrovertently the biggest time film ever filmed."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Mon says that his response to Russia's enhanced military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will be only reduced by violence and destruction for millions of people.
The UN-Chief again calls on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to cooperate and to support integrated negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he was planning to meet with the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent members of the Council - USA, Russia, China, Great Britain and France - at the end of the General Assembly's session this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the tensions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional authorities "make this situation impossible."
Ban asked the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity they had demonstrated in the handling of the crisis in Syria when they reached a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 questioned to show that Donald Trump is serious about taking it.
Some have tried to brand him as a flup.
Others rejected him as a witch.
And some are waiting for a crash.
But regardless of how some Republicans try to draw Donald Trump from the top lines of the questionnaires, it has not (yet) worked.
Ten of the last 11 national surveys were conducted in the second area, and some began to ask themselves seriously what it meant for the chances of naming the real estate mogul.
Of course, it's too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump will probably win the republican nomination.
Experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry's leadership was given to the rising Herman Cain, of which no one has won only one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have fought in a general election.
But foreign groups such as Jeb Bushs Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's assets and begin to let their dollar fly to push it.
Here are some current environments that indicate that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity values have turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidate in mid-June, a survey by the Monmouth University showed that only two of the ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six of the 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures remain in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week revealed that 60 percent of the Republicans had a good opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP voters GOP would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of the Republicans said they would either be "satisfied" or "satisfied" if they were named Trump.
Only two of 10 said they'd be "infamous" if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same passion as Trump (43% say they would be "deprived" vs. 40% who say the same about Trump).
The next thing you want?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republican voters said they would be "satisfied" or "depressed" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not view Trump's temperature as a problem.
While Donald Trump is still criticised for his bombistic and misleading statements, 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperature for a president, so ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the first pre-election state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where 52 per cent of the Republicans think he has the personality of a commander, according to Quinnipic last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively perform his office, and almost six of 10 dependants say that his temperature does not fit into the white house, so ABC/Post.
Republican voters are familiar with the idea.
When they set up their educational institutes, Republican electors think they're real.
If they are asked who won the GOP nomination first, they say after a CNN/ORC survey last week four out of ten that Trump is the best law.
That's a change since the time four of the 10th of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Complete explanation: GOP voters in the past did not have the clearest crystal balls.
At this point in the last cycle, four of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination against only 28% for the final candidates in the city of Romney.
However, it turns out that a large number of GOP voters consider Trumps campaignable.
Even if the Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the scattered field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-trup support is distributed to more than a thousand other candidates diffusively.
But a survey of the Monmouth-University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-and-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump received majority support.
He has 13 points in front of Carly Fiorina, 14 points in front of Marco Rubio, 15 points in front of Walker, 19 points in front of Jeb Bush and finally 33 points in front of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a head-and-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who hit him?
Ben Carson would keep the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-and- head race.
A small majority of Donald-Trup-Fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new survey by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump say that they have made their votes firm.
Of course, much can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change the opinion.
46 percent said they let the door open to switch to other candidates.
However, Trumps is the strongest competition at the time of the other external page, the neurosurgery Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as often for Trump.
Six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump, in his election campaign two months ago called immigrants from Mexico "more violent", the immigration was a three-and-a-a-half public talk in 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombing expression by Trump will be carried out by the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But after the new ABC/Post poll from Monday, six of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as the migration remains in the framework light, Donald Trump seems to do the same.
The frustration on the government focuses on new peaks.
At Donald Trump and Ben Carson, about half of the support of Republican voters, especially by their foreign status, is still available.
Six of the 10 Republicans say in the new ABC/Post Montags survey, they prefer a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also angry at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Blomberg in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three of four Iowa Republicans were frustrated with the Republicans at the Congress, 54% "unsatisfied" and 21% "wolly disappointed".
München, Sylt and Co.: The five exclusive dwelling areas of Germany
Here on the Hobookenway is the most expensive accommodation - overlooking the North Sea.
In the street, a square meter of a railway home is costing €73,300.
"Of course, the offer of objects is limited by nature," it says in the study - so the high price.
A new study shows in which special layers a square meter costs most.
Of course, 18.70 Euro per square metre for a student's offer in Munich are not really small.
In contrast to Germany's top housing, one of the prices is presented as Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Angel & Peoples has published a list of the most exclusive German residential areas - with square meters prices in fast-growing heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euro nothing - per square metre, well-marked.
But it's good who can afford it...
Other: Munich is not even on the top.
Champions League: Bayern-Triumstart thanks Müller and Gods
Two tours in Piréus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller has just a run.
A happy encounter by Thomas Müller opened the way for the FC Bayern to a worthy 3:0 at the Olympics Prize - then loved's.
A sovereign appointment of the Champions League season.
World Master Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have protected the FC Bayern in the Hexenkessel of Piraeus in the "Mission Milan" mission.
The crew of Trainer Pep Guardiola won their award in the League champions at the Greek record teacher Olympics in hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's Doublepack (52/90.+2) and God's encounter (89.) worth 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth lead in series is to be the first step towards Finale on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola will finally take the anchorpot to Munich at the third stage.
Müller received helpful assistance from the Olympicos Torvart Roberto, who was a flanke-in-the-flanke expert of the World Master's Championships.
"We won't appreciate them," said Captain Bayern Philipp Lahm in front of the game at the Karaskakis Stadium before 31.688 hot blue fans - and the Munichers kept their word.
They showed a concentrated and committed presentation, without glancing.
Piraeus had won his youngest six home games in the Royal Class, including against famous clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borusia Dortmund (1:3) also became a member of the Bourussia Dortmund.
However, the Bayerns, who were unscathed in seven European cups with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They took courage, but often they went to work in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were carried out too often on the left-hand side of Douglas Costa, who rarely passed against the former Braunschweider Omar Eladellaoui.
Müller had more happiness on the right than his flange from the right half field joined in the upper toreck on the left.
In the 67th minute the world master gave the possible 2:0.
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, as the Olympics-Sturmer Ideye Brown shot the Poland's headball from the line (26).
Then by taking direct action, the Torvart Roberto compares with the knife (35.).
Although the Bayerns used to play a dominant game, Piraeus was able to set Christmas stick.
On Torhuter Manuel Neuer, however, was released.
Just like he tied an Ideye shot over the latte (56).
Before Newer, Guardiola had a four-storey with David Alaba in the center near Jerome Boating, which made it good.
Mario Götze, after muscle problems back into the frame, at first outside.
The WM-held only gave green light after the completion of the training, said sports president Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "If anyone wants to do anything else, that's already bad".
On the first exchange, Guardiola also decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the captured Lewandowski (59).
Gods later came for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, by Elfmeter, the miller set another route.
Before the game, it was in the stadium to cry.
After a small group of partially inspired Bayern fans in their visitor block had publicly provoked the attachment of guests to Piréus with words and gestures, the security forces were attacked and attacked against the Munich fans.
At least one Bayern fan was transported from the stadium.
Those who smoke have a higher risk of losing teeth
Whoever laughs, harms not only the lungs, but also the teeth - this puts a potsdamer long-term study close.
The good news: When you lose sight of the danger quickly.
Smokers have a very high risk of losing their teeth early.
This results from a long-term study of an international research team, including several staff members of the German Food Research Institute (DifE) in Potsdam.
In comparison with non-smoking smokers, the risk of losing their teeth was provisional to increase the 2.5 to 3.6 times higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are caries and dementations of the tooth flesh, the DIFE stresses.
For this paradoxitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors stress.
Therefore, the relationship between smoking and tooth loss leads to more frequent tooth loss in smoking.
It is not clear that smoking also increases the risk of cancer.
People who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, write the researchers in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could last for more than ten years until the threat returned to the level of non-smoking, explained Professor Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham.
It is necessary to convince people to become non-smoking, said study leader Heiner Boeing of the DIFE: "Surgery shortens the lifetime."
Not to smoke is good for long and fat and leads to good dental health to high age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population between 65 and 74 years of age were affected by toothlessness, sharing the DIFE.
Early studies had already shown that smoking increased the risk of early tooth decay.
The new long - term study underpins the findings.
Archaeologists stood at Kolner Rheinüfer on the rest of the Spattic
For the time being, the right Rheuuffer in Cologne has been made archeological funds.
Near the building for the new Rhineboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-German Museum of Skelette and the rest of historical buildings, said museum leader Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called soil paintings.
At all the construction projects in the city district of Cologne, the museum is always referred to as a professional professional for archaeological ground flooring.
In the third construction section of the Rhineboulevard, archaeologists were now completed.
It has already been known from texts that in the 4th century there was a fortress and a church in the 8th century, three explained.
In addition to the rest of the fortress and the church Tower, a peaceful building with about 350 graves, which was probably part of the church, was discovered.
Young Woman of Good Courage
After a young woman was injured at the railway station in Geilenkirchen Lindern, the federal police asked the people for help.
Early Wednesday morning, at 1.40 p.m., the woman crossed the street building at the end of the train path and was picked up by a freight train that came from Monchengladbach.
According to the Federal Police, the acquisition of the train has resulted in severe injuries.
It was carefully treated in front of the site and was taken into a hospital by rescue forces.
On the basis of the nightly crossover of the young woman, there is no evidence from the authorities concerned.
The event may have been observed by witnesses or the inhabitants have taken acoustic remarks.
Inquiries come from residents or passengers of Linderner Train, railway station, Thomashof Street and Lifefarther Street (L364).
The information given on the cause of the accident can be provided by telephone 0800/6888000 or by any other police service.
EU Commission proposes a new TTIP court in conflict
The EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current judicial system in order to resolve the dispute on the planned Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement.
The conflicting private clearing facilities for disputes between companies and states should therefore be resolved by a transparent system that is significantly more traditional in its functioning.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said in his presentation.
Sweden has proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in free trade talks with the US.
The German Government offered support.
Through TTIP, the world's largest free trade zone is to create 800 million people.
The plans for the reform of the current arbitration procedure provide concretely that the EU and the United States jointly appoint independent judges for a new investment court.
They should come from the EU, the US and third countries alike.
For the first time, there is also a second instance.
She would allow it to appeal against judgments.
Until then, the parties to the proceedings agreed on the case-laws, there was no objection to their judgments.
In the discussion over the past month, it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old ISDN system in matters of fairness and justice, commented Malmstream.
In the long run, they want to work on an international investment court based on their own data.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clarified.
In particular, the investor-States-Scheduling Procedures (ISDS) required by large companies are considered one of the main reasons for great resistance to TTIP in Europe.
The traditional courts are criticised by opponents as a sort of parallelist, the companies are liable to impose fines on tax collectors, to break national laws or to impose a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinion, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact referred to the EU Commission's proposals as insufficient.
In particular, it was criticised that it should not apply to the free trade agreement already negotiated with Canada (Ceta).
The German State Secretary for Economic Affairs Matthias Machnig (SPD) called the plans a major step forward.
The Commission takes into account the important points of the reform that Federal Minister of Economy Sigmar Gabriel has drawn up with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private damages was from the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European business association Europe warned against restricting the scope of the economy by too many new rules.
In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises could benefit from it.
When talks on the TTIP (Transsatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be concluded, it remains unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investment protection has not yet been discussed with the US.
There should be a framework for the Agreement already at the end of this year.
This term is no longer applicable.
Delicate People of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Seventeen years ago Sufjan Stevens was sitting on the stage at the Kolner Prime Club (now Luxor).
In addition to it is a flashcard on which the most effective public singer has marked the US-Michigan painting state with filtration.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost caught by Steven's speech.
He tells about various places that he always sign on the map, about his minusious and cold-arranged songs.
Where they came from and how it looks there, in his home.
Sincere Stevens appears to be a wonderful creative hero.
With the 2003 release and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" suddenly appeared composed songs that are very harmonically close to the American people of the late six-years, but can run into great opposition at any time.
It creates the smell, "Michigan" would be the first part of a series, each of the 50 US states to be judged accordingly.
But already in 2004 and in Rhine, there has already been a "Seven Swans" and a positive set of expectations.
It's reducing Stevens down here.
He's alive enough guitars and Banjo.
A year later, the musicians living in New York return to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinois"), 2005 appears to be a flat-rolled masterpiece.
It's over with ideas and stylistic fitness.
The album stands in the American Billboard Charts and is missing in no annual list of influential music media.
After over-productive experiments, Stevens then looked at "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic supplies.
This sixth regular studio album is still widely orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and halls.
As the smaller clubs grow up, the stage shows here will be a beautiful spectacle from Neon star bands and a large fluorescent stage.
Currently Sufjan Stevens is visiting as part of a five-pound band by Germany.
In the dark Hamburger More!
Theater presents mainly the "Carrie & Lowell" ever since March.
Although nearly 2,000 guests are now allowed to sit in their chairs, the well-known Stevens return to the privacy and the people.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians is playing through the wide-ranging album.
From the audience you hear: the speech is "opulent" and thus you can remove the "plats on the ground".
First of all, Stevens is grateful to be able to express himself, to play a little older songs, and finally to give himself up under the present appeal.
Jeremy Corbyns Debüt at the Prime Minister's poll
Since his election Mr Corbys Debüt has been expected to ask the Prime Minister's question with tension
The new Labour President Jeremy Corbyn will give his debut at the Prime Minister's hour of questioning and will be with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask his first six questions shortly after noon, where his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the lab staff.
He called for "lower theatres and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said he could skip a few meetings to leave his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbys, as it will come after his appointment as member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour President to shut down a 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in style during the National Hymne's singing on Tuesday, caused criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is at the centre of more tittelite stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbys' decision not to sing the national hymns has drawn attention to himself.
A speaker from Mr. Corbyn said that he had "standed in a respectful silence" and had recognized the "Hulden Time of the Royal Air Force in the Air Force of England."
But a member of Mr. Corbys Schattenkabinett, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight Program that he had told the lab's president to sing the national hymns "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a thousand shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbys' top team, and they refer to differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.
The BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stabilised" within the lab, according to Mr Corbins' remarks on position towards the European Union and the limitation of profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that the lab was making changes to remove the whole idea of a restriction as a whole.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow worker and pension minister, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour President, David Cameron, since he is head of Tory, has been in opposition to the Dispatch Box in Parliament in the last decade.
The Labour President, who has promised another policy step, says he has Crowd-sourced ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 arguments.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's time for questioning is too confrontational, and that he will leave both "skilling" and the fight with counterhaking and instead focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle would be represented by the shadow Minister of Economy if he did not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is on his way abroad.
He also brought the idea into the discussion that other colleagues occasionally took the floor, and that he spoke to John Bercow, the speaker of the basement, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to get rid of politics in the style of a "Kasperle-Theater", which was often associated with the Prime Minister's question. But a few years later he realized that he had failed.
Since she was first sent on television in 1990, the polling hour with the Prime Minister was viewed as the most important barometer of the trial of a leader and his leadership in the house and his position among his fellow Members, although critics argued that she became a cartoonist and needed further reforms.
'Geschossen in Joburg': Obscene young people trained to photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a close-up place when one is blind.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn skills and to earn a living.
"I what shot in Joburg" (I was in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches undisclosed young people how they take photos from their environment and achieve a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.

Fund increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The fund rose rapidly after data showing an increase in the United Kingdom's wage growth. In parallel, FTSE 100 was increased by SABMiller's offer target.
Between May and July, the result without Boni in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% over the same period of previous year.
This percentage has been the fastest and most estimated at the time of interest increase since 2009.
The fund rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $1,5505 and was reduced to 0.84 % against the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1,49 % to 6,229,21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20 % jump after the acquisition offer of the Rivalen AB InBev was made.
A transaction would combine the world's two largest brewers and combine brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were, according to encouraging news from the competition company for luxury silver coins, 0.9% higher.
Richemont's latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - re-stated growth.
The share of Glencore rose by 5 % after the mountain-bauriese said that it had acquired $2.5 billion through a sale of shares as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper company Mondi were the biggest losses on the index, with a decrease of 4.3 % after Goldman Sachs had put his estimate for the company rating to "sale".
JD sports increased by 3.1% after the sport clothing company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million.
The chief of JD Sports says higher wages threatened the expansion.
JD Sports Manager Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will equal the higher labour costs of his company, he says.
The costs could meet the expansion plans of JD sports, he added, and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: At Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Läppische 21 years old, a deal with oversold frise.
The type with the platinum hair is 100 million euros hard.
Even more.
Mr. Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And generation U17 goes through.
Like Victoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old didn't hear the name "Ritz Carlton" yet.
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
Since 7 o'clock in the morning, however, the police are sitting on the cold stone plates in the form of Berlin's luxury hotel at Potsdamer Square.
The Bieber-Build: Here is your idol, whose poster is already hanging in Stettin, since Montagabend.
The suite, in which the Canadian singer lives, costs as much as her mom Eve earns in half a year.
If at all.
He says, "In fact, my Victoria had to sit in the tenth grade in Gymnasium."
"I fill her with a dream."
School duty?
Who jockts?
Don't fuck with me.
Neither does Bieber.
He didn't take care of it.
For advertising in the Superbowl's advertising break, he cast three million dollars, a two-year-old deal with an anti-Pickle firm played many, many dollars on a beer account.
And every pump that looks like he's going through the cargo is also caster.
If Justin Bieber drinks a cup of coffee, you stand on the window table.
More than 100 million people are supposed to have felt this way.
Some say the Hype went too far.
Other emphasis, beeber is finally in the United States and Britain with his new single "What do you mean?" on page 1.
Even beeber himself, whose fourth album is to be followed in November, many zeros are not interested at first.
At least you do that.
Pegida Placat brings Lebanon to Cartofelöner ideas
Cardboards or teeth?
It is both - and it is in the Cartofelnöer, which was developed by the Oldenburg Imbis owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the phrase "kartofel instead of Donner" on a poster of Pegida movement, Allay Kartofel and meat were placed together on a couch.
On the idea, he was given a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the title "Cartofolln instead of Donner", which he had occasionally seen on television.
Since then, in his load, he has a grilled syringe with meat and potatoes.
"It's a multiculti for the stomach," says Alay.
The idea has been introduced to the Lebanese between the patent office in Munich.
It has been protected there as a pattern of use, as stated by the Authority.
As much meat and as many potatoes contain the flavor, Allaha wants not to talk.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
The culinary people's understanding also comes well with its customers.
Metcash launched a underground campaign to fight the Aldi attack
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA files from an old trail in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a underground campaign to protect the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the face of an $700 million Oldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing for the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 countries in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of the next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing on social media, as well as on events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as Eishers Simmo from Dunsborough, which distributes samples in IGA countries and purchases of licensed tickets for South Australian football to trusted customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when the wholesaler carries out its annual investor strategy day for food, alcohol and equipment.
There is a lot of emphasis on the game as South Australia and Western Australia generate almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA charging business and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the East.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notorious provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the East.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will be eliminated by about five per cent of the food market in these two countries and all existing actors, but mainly individual dealers will be removed.
According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in next year and will achieve a turnover of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss of food and food business and the amount of the high fixed cost base at Metcash could cost Metcash around $13 million in advance of interest and taxes, said Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the East, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent inquiry by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most reliable.
Morgan Stanley notes that Metcash's consumption in food and food business will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018 and by reducing market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglas, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told at a business session in Melbourne that Metcash will probably disappear within a decade. Metcash will disappear.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglas's comments.
But it will be concluded that a member of Metcash has contacted Mr Douglas last week.
Since 2010, IGA's market share has decreased from 18 per cent to 14 per cent, and income from Metcash's food and food trade, which provides about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting the operational debt recovery at the same time on consumption and margins.
However, the wholesaler remains and invests more than $150 million in order to compare sales prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their countries through faster growing fresh foods and to provide a better choice of private label foods.
Metcash's chief business leader, Ian Morrise, says that the price adjustments and charging programmes will be applied to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Verband Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damages" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise in the eyes of the president of the Australian Tennis League Steve Healy rather than criticism of his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duos, which is always referred to as "Special Ks", is led by the famous installation of Kyrgyos with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters in the framelight.
In a fiery qualification game in Cincinnati soon thereafter, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the judge, where Harrison said: "Warinka had to beat Kyrgyos, and I should have hit the child."
While he was last seen how he hit a tennis player after a raid destroyed a potential US opening victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis of Healy was firmly protected.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in the competition with Sam Groth in the second place behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"One thing that I'm quite excited about is the fact that, in my view, Thanasi was a little involved in the fight," said Healy.
He's broken a knife when he lost a fight in the US-open, but he's not the first player to break a knife from his own belly, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved very well in the US-opens, even under the very provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He's got a great team around here, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too hard.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the area of clothing, he is trained hard, he is well in shape, he is a very stable and powerful young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own services.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgyzstan's important decision on Friday, and he described the "common decision" as the right one for all, but he assured the man from Canberra to return to the team as a longer-term solid component."
"First, we want the team to focus entirely on the competition and not on all the controversy around [Kyrgyos]," said Healy.
And I think Nick has made the rise very fast, where people like Federers and Murray have shown up. He is standing in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time outside the framework where he can only think about it, I hold fit, and it's the best for humanity and it's the best for him.
Europe's Refugee Crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency and arranged the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and determined all who tried to enter the country illegally. All with the aim of stopping the flow of migrants.
Chaos followed the border, as hundreds of migrants gathered in a non-member country and responded to Serbian officials with improvisation.
The people who had fled before violence had spent an unknown time on the road between the two control points of the countries and built cells and were down there.
But the frustrations grew.
As a police conspirator over them, the migrants scand "Opens the border!" and shouted charges against the Hungarian security police.
Some show back from protest food and water.
Serbia's Foreign Minister stated that it would be “unacceptable” that migrants from Hungary would be sent back, while more and more from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There must be conversations with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turbulence at the Hungarian-Serbian border arrived one day after the 28th national block in Brussels at a very strict meeting of immigration policies.
However, the Ministers agreed to share the responsibility of 40,000 people seeking asylum in overcrowded Italy and Greece. They expressed their hope that, at the end of the next month or by the end of the year, the EU would conclude an agreement that more than 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary, would be included.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria asked on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis in the continent.
However, Hungary did not put its hopes on a valid action by Brussels or by its neighbours.
The emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to address the crisis, so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto pointed out that his country was also planning to stop the flow of migrants through the country - after it ended up at the Serbian border.
CBS News Correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison officers were used in the race to create the Stacheldraht-Zaun between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major step forward and entry into the European Union for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has concluded that most incoming economic refugees are looking for a better life and not war refugees who claim protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws that enter into force on Wednesday night in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4-metre (13 feet) high zoos that the government has built along the southern border to Serbia to commit a crime. These laws also impose higher penalties on convicted human dealers.
"In view of the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the state of need," said government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say very clearly: illegal crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree on procedure with the use of the military, which is expected for the next week, but Reporters of Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for a long time.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Country Security Adviser for Orban, said that 45 authorities were already deeply involved in the country in an attempt to cross the border.
They come over by harming the zoo, they are now in police custody, and they will be charged with the prosecution of criminal offences in accordance with the new laws.
Authorities are about to repair the wound quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday afternoon, after a train ride with steel wire to close the border.
Chaos surrounded the most important border crossings near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process data from people and press a crowd to enter.
About 20 came in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the most important bus connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they could travel to Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clintons Premier for Bernie Sanders in National Survey
Former US Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-way lead in the democratic run on the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins against the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47% of the democratic voters in the elections (58% before), while Sanders is second in second place, with 27% (up to 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is candidate for the presidency, receives 15 per cent of the democratic voters' support.
More than five months before the elections began, most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidates will support them.
But Clinton's supporters are more stable in their choice than the other candidates.
Since the CBS-News survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders achieved some gains.
Clinton holds a big lead in women and balance, but these premises have decreased.
Her support with the men is very weak, and Sanders is only here with 5 points back.
Clinton's advantage for democratic voters has been refugees for over 50 years, and they and Sanders are now at the same height.
Clinton, however, is still a great precedent for the older voters.
In the past month, Clinton was in front of Sanders with two-twenty priority at the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point priority at this group.
Almost half of the democratic voters of the elections have said in the country that they would support with enthusiasm Clinton if they were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15% would only support them because they are the candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are particularly interested in her.
The views are strongly mixed with those who do not support Clinton today - only about a quarter would be willing to support them.
While 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16%), is that it is time to be a woman president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10%).
By Clinton's supporters, their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent) is also mentioned.
Approval to deal with the problems and the availability are also cited.
Since the vice-president puts a potential for the presidential office in the Waagschal, 57 percent of the democratic voters wanted to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not.
If democratic voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, there is a request at the top.
From Clinton's attachment more than half said that their second choice would be far from Sanders.
If Bide decides not to apply for the nomination of Democrats, Hillary Clintons will increase the lead before Sanders, from 20 points with Bide in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win the election; however, this number has fallen by 78 percent in the last month.
Prayer is a second time at this measurement, but the percentage that views it as "the most selective" has increased.
However, when it comes to what is more important for a candidate, democratic voters are calling questions about the availability of elections.
As in the last month, no single democratic candidate or potential candidate will appear to be unacceptable to these voters.
The democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some important features when selecting their party's preferences.
Most considered Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and reliable and equipped with strong driving qualities.
Prayer cuts off the three candidates best from honesty, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Three percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, so many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not think of him.
Democrats of the choices are generally seen as well by Clinton, Sanders and Biden in line with their views.
At all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server are continued as foreign minister during the term of office, most democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions in general.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about one third are satisfied.
The public opinion on this was broken in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail contesters had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said that their opinion was still wrong.
They are mainly Republicans, more than six of 10, who say that their views have become worse than Clinton.
Although Clinton is viewed by the voters of her party as honest and reliable, this is still a problem for them all: only 32 percent see them as honest and reliable, eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May.
62% of the voters do not hold them for an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of the eligible countries view Trump as not being honest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good notes when driving.
Of the six tested candidates cut bids, Carson and Bush best at honesty.
A majority look more honest than Sanders, but like Carson, many don't think of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson returns to a country-wide survey near Donald Trump
Ben Carson is at the latest CBS News/New York Times close behind Donald Trump
The two candidates fall between half of the support of the voters in the new survey and lose others dramatically
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers. Support increases by 23% in the latest CBS survey conducted in Fox News debate last month to 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson dropped from 6 % to 23 % during the same period.
The survey also found that Carson is well-encumbered in democratic groups and that he is overprivileged with higher education among Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been cut off with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen to the lowest level, with 10% of support in the last month at 2%.
The former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are 6% in the third place.
The error margin in the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest survey is 6 % plus or less and was implemented in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey, published last week, shows that Carson is increasing in the questionnaires - it will receive 19% support from the Republicans, after the storm with 32% support.
The latest survey of ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly before Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising in the last week, Trup found some sidehibes for the former neurosurgery, even after Carson decided to question Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump on the last Saturday during a campaign event in Iowa.
Comfortable bathroom temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is up to 29 degrees Fahrenheit [29 ° C].
Even if peak values are measured only in the distance, there is already a trip to the Mediterranean to find still warm water.
A bath in North or Oscee should be a rather short entertainment at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some are no longer going to the sea: Maximum 18 degrees has the water in the north and east this week, sharing the German Weather Service (DWD).
In contrast, bathing temperatures continue to provide the Mediterranean: In the east they reach up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is 25 degrees above, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees.
Five members of the brotherhood were responsible for the death of a Baruch College-Neulings
Almost two years after a student died during a professional ritual of a student's association in Pocono Mountain, Pennsylvania, he was murdered, murder charges were filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta Psi-Bruderschaft caught Chun "Michael" Deng during an introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police shared with him.
Officials said he was charged with a 30-pound bag full of sand with connected eyes, and was repeatedly attacked while trying to cross a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, and then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta Psi pregnancy did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng became ill-treated and apparently waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, so the police did.
However, they had the time to change deng's clothes to remove his symptoms and Andy Meng, to contact the national presidents of the brotherhood, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide themselves and put the welfare of the brotherhood basically on the part of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be relived, and he died the next morning at his injuries.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added with stupor force injuries to the head, lungs and upper jaws.
"Many families were destroyed by the scans of the brotherhood. At least one student dies every year from 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a legal lawyer who published Deng's family in a statement.
Brothers and their members must be taken into account, and this step by the authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury by Monroe recommends a complaint for murder third grade for the first five members.
Twenty-three members of the brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also accused of deliberate attacks and of the formation of a criminal union.
"We not only want to take responsibility for the persons involved, but if there is an organization that has officially or informally Sanctified this, then we will take them to account," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has denied its membership to the local group.
This will happen when the fat increases the interest
An increase in interest rates will occur, and the house will be reduced, rents for loans will rise, and the economy will suffer in a recession.
We know that.
What we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will be held.
In particular, the history of the economy offers only limited guidance on how to run.
A recession occurred within 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in the fight against interest rates is often, although not always, a factor in how the economy and financial institutions react.
Therefore, the representatives of the US Central Bank stressed that investors should not focus on this when they start to raise interest rates, but rather on the time needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
At the end, however, market participants may find that the whole rise is likely to have been exceeded due to an increase in interest rates.
"The first increase in the fed since the global financial crisis will without fail be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of "slight money"," said Julian Jessop, chief economics, in a communication to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the overall return of the U.S. coins to normal heights, but still to a low level to lead to seismic shock, which many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no effects.
Here is a historical view of how some areas of the economy might react:
As the market has seen in the last month, the advance of interest increases can make things for a long time volutil.
As soon as the increase occurs, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency to withdraw assets 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy again," German bank analysts said in a new study on what happens after interest increases in the fed.
It is said that in the last 35 years, the market is mostly in the front-end – about 14 percent – on the road to the interest rate increase, slightly in the 250 days (mean gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average yield in the previous six cycles of 14.4 percent according to an current analysis published by Bob Doll, Head of the plant strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
The Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the growth cycle and that the interest rates are beginning to decrease.
Reactions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases are often promoted.
In the present case, the liver is faced with some conditions that did not occur before and could accelerate a recession.
It is particularly noteworthy that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at a interest rate increase in the fat.
According to Deutsche Bank, there have been 118 interest increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, only a few expected this to take place and expected only 1.5 per cent for the third quarter following the statement of Atlanta Fed.
Interest increases in such a fragile economic environment could be risky and raise the question whether this time is different, the German bank said.
Market participants have made an increase in interest rates throughout the year, and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategies and economies believe that the FOMC could allow for an increase in this session, the future handle only provides a 25 per cent probability.
"In our study, all the rise cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super-cycle with increasing momentum at the BIP, and pre-restational peaks have been placed very quickly after the start of recovery," says the report.
In contrast, this is clearly a slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the fed has expected since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months to come.
The fixed income was also volitilised as the market was expected to increase interest, and the pattern is relatively similar to that in the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on loans is faster than that of shares when they change their strategic course.
In the case of loans, the interest rate appears to change the direction as soon as the first increase/reduction occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the sponsors were immediately, the Deutsche Bank said.
The strategies of Charles Schwab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer integration of interest rates between longer and shorter loans and a break in the curve.
High-quality loans often bring better results in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher returns", said Kathy Jones, a fixed-in-Case analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed's strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some indications that the market has adapted to the view of stricter monetary policies," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the profit curve is flat, credit savings have increased and volatility has increased - all features of the market when the fed strengthens its strategy.
In the larger and larger sectors, companies that cover the largest part of their business in the USA will benefit from rising interest rates and attracting local products.
Multinational companies with high debt will become worse because a growing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debt.
"The history shows that "Quality-" shares are not going to react positively three months after an initial interest increase," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Firms with a strong balance sheet have, by weight, over 5 percentage points after each increase in interest rates 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low liquidity in their shares also exceed their pendants with low quality, averagely 4 (percent points) and 3 (percent points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible profits will lose most of them, Goldman said.
In addition to the pure stock games, consumers are also benefiting from the growing dollar.
Savers could see profits from higher incomes, even if experts have different opinions on how quickly this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says Parliamentary Member Andrew Bingham.
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the sender for his "overdummulation"
He argues that it is not too much to differ from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The Brits.
Member of Parliament Damien Collins seized the message The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "changes" to Classic FM, asserts a leading member of Parliament and increases the pressure on the sender to prove that he does something that does not the private senders do.
Conservative Commissioner Andrew Bingham also told the BBC-Boss that the public-law broadcaster is "misleading" and is increasingly no longer different from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "vardumen" - but it seems to change to Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which started in December last.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be only under another name.
So if you're trying to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples that you're actually just imitating what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The BBC Director-General showed the preambles and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public disclosure.
What I learn from Radio 3 will learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment for live music and music, which is really unsurpassed.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and to get new jobs in order, I also really think it's important," he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it was more important to work on the public than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was not, however, the only element of BBC production, which, during the hearing of the Committee on the selection of culture, media and sport, was to put the commercial rivals on the feet.
The Tory-Ornet Damien Collins captures The Voice - the music Talent show of the BBC, purchased by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated costs of 22 million £.
See why this program is often discussed because it is not original and is not particularly marked?
Lord Hall claimed that the BBC 1-show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as director - was produced "on a special BBC way".
He added that he wanted the company to "find a hit from our own stable" when it was next start a maintenance series.
However, he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future or to issue money from the taxpayer for other maintenance forms.
Internet facilities rise in August at the lowest and the Black Friday can be responsible for this.
In the first three months of 2015 there was seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month, the lowest result was from the beginning of the records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using phones to buy
Experts believe the Black Friday has broken the expenses in November
For over a decade, the virtual purchase has been built, and many of the main shopping streets in Britain have changed to spirit cities.
However, experts say that there are now indications that the online transfers are slowing down after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the censuses in 2000 with only five per cent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales slow down after new numbers only seven percent increase in the first three months 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, then this has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, publisher of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began to engage in their mobile purchases.
It meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different settings, such as at home on the sofa.
But now it's falling apart, and we're probably going to experience a decrease in growth.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the remaining sales.
Experts believe that buyers will resume their purchases prior to this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
In the past year, the average number of buyers was five times cut to make their computers, and some dealer websites broke down.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers fought for shoes, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study of the British Retail Consortium found that out of 5 £ of expenditure, more than £1 was issued online.
In some products, such as television and washing machines, more than a third of the purchase is now carried out via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chain in the cities.
Muslims bury the victims in Mekka at the Kran accident - Bin Laden's family is Sanctified
The bodies of 29 deaths are carried by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca by the streets
Saudi Arabia partially contributes to the collapse of the heavy Saudi Bin-Laden group
The Ministry of Health said that, in addition, 394 people were injured after the cancer struck
Hundreds of Muslims gathered as 29 of the victims were taken through the streets to bury those who were killed, when a cancer on Mecca's Great Moscée collapsed.
Saddened, widely dressed in white, the steps to earn their respect, as the first of the dead touched their last trip to Al-Moaissem Peace Court.
The procession went on to the Holy Place, where only days before a baukran passed through the cloud of the mosque and then to the bathrooms.
The bodies were released for execution when the Saudi King imposed a penalty on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 bets, who were killed, when a cranled by the Great Central Mekkas, were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Great Manchester, father of four children who were on his first pilgrimage when the cancer submerged.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual feast in the Great Mosche.
Saudi officials have already determined that the Hadsch to Mekka with thousands who will continue to come to the city will continue.
Today King Salman, the bin-laden group, would not have allowed the arm of the cancer to stand if he had not been used.
An Arabic version of the decree published by the state Saudi Press Agency said the bin-laden group was responsible for the merger.
The English-language news agency did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company was prohibited from travelling abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman believed to realize what caused the sound of the cran, which broke into an inner courtyard of the Great Mosche, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Haddsch, which took place later this month.
The bin-Laden Group has not issued any statements on the merger of the Krans, and its representatives are not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also addressed the group because of no current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Thousands of cranes around Mekas Großmosee as part of the massive construction project, which is directed by the bin-laden group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the Governing family of Saudi Arabia for decades and has taken larger construction projects.
The deceased leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a prodigal son who was adopted by the family in the 1990s.
The outbreak of the cancer occurred in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrim journey, which is needed at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people stayed in the hospital.
Government representatives arranged that 1 million Rial (£ 174,000) should be paid to the members of the deaths and the same amount of permanent damage.
Other losses receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European handshake is over
Britons work increasingly hand workers, says Veronique Lauri
The number of qualified manual workers from Eastern Europe has increased behind
This leads to the opening of 200 more Screwfix countries that target manual workers.
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q sales worldwide
From Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of Daily Mail
It is claimed that the British lower their brakes and pens in favour of the use of qualified oste-European manuals carrying out the work in their home
If you are able to walk around with a hammer or a pen to strike walls, today you seem to belong to a minority.
Because the UK employs increasingly manual workers to carry out homework in their homes, so the company's head behind B&Q.
Verónique Lauri, a new business leader of Kingfisher, who owns the tree market chain, said that a large increase in the number of qualified workers from Eastern Europe who offer services at deep-sea prices has been overcome.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix Shops, which are directed to handwashers and close to 60 B&Q sales sites.
Mrs. Lauri said she wanted to hire more women in B & Q-shops, as eight out of ten purchase decisions were met by women.
At the moment, the staff will be able to pass on the men.
She said that it would be necessary to put forward the growing demographic trends that show more female female households, which take more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laurie said: "It's still working for a lot of men in our branches.
We need to move this closer to a balance.
In principle, half of our clients from women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Lauri, who is one of only five women at the top of a British company listed in the FTSE100 Index, has also redesigned her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company owned by nearly 50 percent of the team with women, including its business management and financial standing.
Mrs. Lauri said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It wasn't hard to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in the half-year period and the transfers after the group saved the costs for closing the countries.
Because of the trend, 200 new branches will be opened by Kingfisher, the screwfix and B&Q.
Officers of Aich/Dob due to interference before the Court
At the National Court of Justice Klagenfurt, two officials of the Austrian volleyball visemeister Aich/Dob had to answer on Wednesday because of threats and abuses.
The defendants did not confess.
One of them was also charged with abuse of authority.
In May, he was legally released from this draft.
The current process has been suspended.
According to Oberstaatswanalt Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, the complainants had used funds from the United States accounts for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011.
The damage is estimated to be around 400 000 euros.
Sports officials are also accused of financial fraud.
This fact was rejected by the President of the Creator’s Senate, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It should be negotiated at a later date.
For the purpose of the dispute, the defence showed that the union was not at any time a part of its assets.
The sports operators had calculated only outstanding damages and the sports club for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, had been defrayed from the debt - the liabilities were around 600,000 Schilling in 2001 (approx. 44,000 euros).
"At that time we were in front of the situation: are we taking the club further or are we closing?" said one of the defendants, the chief executive of the fund.
He then decided to take up this task with his colleagues and colleagues.
With all the risks.
"We have proposed money, our life assurances have been held by the bank," he said at the conclusion.
The agreement has been agreed: you can manage the money freely, it can only be made free of charge.
Furthermore, where appropriate, the payment of the damages has been decided in effect until 1991.
Therefore, some of the damages have been paid in the first year of 2003, i.e. since 2003, as a plus on the account.
Therefore, there also appeared to be pauses and not details, the former Ombudsman explained the past.
The accounts and savings managed the two defendants together, said the second defendant.
The judge asked why the payments were not detailed to the Union.
The Union has not been interested in the details of the financial recovery, whether it was only the freedom of debt, the answer.
When an official statement of abuse began in 2011, an amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the Union account.
That's what the defendants said.
This securities account loved the name of the second defendant and was not known according to its statement to the Union.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The questioned did not know the answer for long.
Then he concluded that he believed this was the best for the union.
If something happened to him, no one had known anything about this money, the government attorney put it in the room.
The defendant had been informed, the officer had rectified.
This reference was formulated as "dangerous improvement".
Why the damage?, the judge and the state attorney wanted to know.
In this connection, the first complainant stated that he had not agreed with this formulation because the association had never suffered harm.
But what do I do when the lawyer says, "With that you're all out of the snow."
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
Further, the executive said that he had never had a cent of maintenance, he calculated only kilometres and diets.
On diets, he took into account the unit of EUR 1,000 per month, but the actual expenditure was much higher, added.
The appellants were unable to provide precise data for the early years.
They explained that they were no longer saved after a check on the operation in which they had been properly assessed.
The second defendant also had a mile of money.
In his speech, he explained that he had to travel from his residence to the Bank to Bleiburg.
The main proceedings will be continued on 23 September with the inquiry of witnesses.
Hewlett Packard has another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the three-year staffing process, computer work will be increased when the company starts.
The positions in the US computer series Hewlett Packard (HP) are not final.
As part of its restructuring, the US technology companies plan to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in their company customers.
This would allow costs of $2.7 billion (2.4 billion) to be allocated to the company on the business day.
The step will lead to a special charge of about $2.7 billion, which will fall from the fourth quarter.
The construction of 55,000 jobs has not been completed for three years.
HP employed around 302,000 employees at the end of the business year 2013/14.
After the birth, the Hewlett Packard Act was 2.3 percent.
The group with printers from the California Palo Alto is currently engaged in: the computer and printing business is still to be combined in a new society - apart from the more powerful areas with computer services and data storage for companies and other services.
Both parts of the business should be recorded on the board.
A new downturn of PC and a weaker demand for corporate customers after their services set the world's second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo.
In the third business quarter at the end of July, the percentage of PCs and printers returned to 11.5 percent.
The turnover fell by 8 percent to nearly $25.4 billion.
So the discharges went back in 15 of the 16 quarters.
HP responds with a slowing and massive shift of position on the change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has only recently responded to the fact that customers strengthen their smartphones and tablets instead of buying ordinary computers and making more business online.
Whitman's restructuring plans totalling about 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: Most support the anti-IS training mission
However, the direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be excessive: 54% spoke out, 35% voted in favour.
The other countries' air attacks against the IS in Iraq and Syria are 61% positive.
However, 24 percent are involved in the conflict.
A cooperation with the Syrian army of Bashar al-Assad will result in 51 percent of the respondents, 20 percent of them.

Car: Second press day on the 66th IAA
At the centre of the fair are connected by 27 September, self-propelled cars and electromobility.
After two press days, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto "Reconnected mobility" on Thursday.
The wide audience can visit the IAA on Saturday.
The organizers from the VDA Auto-Connector are expected to have approximately 900 000 visitors two years ago.
Röszke: Violence at Serbian-Ugarish borders
The Hungarian police have used the Serbian border at Röszke Trenengas and waterborne refugees against several hundred refugees.
Euronews Correspondent Daniel Bozsik lived at the border control point.
He reported on phone:
A group of refugees crossed the border.
However, a police line had been formed and behind the police was a water heater.
40 to 50 refugees started shooting at the officials with stones, sticks and plastic bottles.
The officers first set up an uninterrupted pfeffer spray.
Then the police used trains.
Many trains were promised to the refugees.
So the group was dissolved.
The refugees are now waiting for something to come back.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone.
Children who had taken the train call.
Other refugees slept together and left under the roof.
The Serbian police also experienced injuries through the use of Trenengas and Pfeffer spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US note bank
The world observes that when the US note bank meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not the interest has been raised for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economies asked by Reuters found that a little more than half the last week of the view that the fed will do this now think that the fat will be worse and the interest rates will remain at the present rate of 0 - 0.25 per cent.
It's a historic event, because it's seven years here, since the Fed's been on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Head of Staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is in a relatively good performance state, billions of dollars are added to balance and generate only a small inflation.
However, the fed cannot ignore the less negative view of global relations.
She warned the markets to increase, but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good.
The decision is to be announced at 20 a.m. on Thursday
Protection of death at Delta State University behind charges
After the shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying that it "leid him" at the first murder and wanted to "he could make it go away," authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, a professor for geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number against 10:00 on Monday morning
And he said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the staff of the emergency headquarters that the police had to send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "six dog" is in the house, but that "no one's gonna be disturbed" but it's probably going to be upset.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give it to him.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When the police took the scene, they found Amy Prentiss' body, 41, and a written note of Lamb, 45, who said: "I'm sorry, I wanted to, I could do it backwards.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb was 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday evening as a policeman.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lambs' proposal."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb apparently believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" for a "threek relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who claimed that they had been married for about seven years, as a "good man".
The two were shot 15 years ago, but friends remained.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19, and they were "damaged on the ground."
He said Prentiss was her daughter's best friend.
Prentiss worked online from home, according to a statement by Lindsday Knowles, which was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owns a dog named Lightning, had been with Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said Lamb had called at a certain point on Monday to tell them, "I'm not going to jail".
As police escorted him on Highway 1 near Greenville later this night, Lamb ran his car to the side, flew to foot, fell into the woods and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctoral title from the Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as his lifesla says on the University's website.
Stars that have lost their happiness-supply
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he fought against Leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-term partner, Farrah Fawcett, for cancer.
The actor has apparently also fought drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
I'm sure that's what he needs.
Eurowings: Aircraft builds the group around
The Lufthansa plants a large group building.
A half billion euros a year wants to save the Lufthansa Group alone with a better organization.
150 of the world's around 1000 driving forces will cost the company's jobs.
There are new negotiations with the pilot industry.
The Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and honors the Eurowings Billigart.
The aim of the new approach was to contribute around 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue synergy, which the airlines shared on Wednesday.
Among other things, in the future, there is no government for the passenger business at the Lufthansa.
The Eurowings flight should be developed as self-contained as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garandt will be responsible for Eurowings in the future at the board of directors of Carsten Spohr.
With the refurbishment, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the group wants to be represented in the future against Ryanair and Easyjet.
Until then, the organization of the 120,000 employees was a strong company complex.
The flights signed under the roof of the passenger Airlines group, which represents three quarters of the annual budget of EUR 30 billion.
New negotiations with the pilots
The negotiations should be resumed on this Thursday following the course of proceedings on the basis of the tariff dispute with the Cockpit Air Force (VC).
That's what shared the partnership.
The subject of the conversation should be the peace arrangement for pilots.
Cockpit wants to come as soon as possible "in one year with a forecasted record result".
The conflict between trade and Airlines has led to various conflicts over the past months.
In addition to the transitional supply of pilots, the "Wings" concept is the backbone.
It appears that in the fight against competitors, the Lufthansa is putting out of the company's Eurowings Billings.

Luke Shaw from Manchester United can't play for months because of a double fracture
Luke Shaw experienced a double fracture of his right leg at the champions-League-Negation of Manchester at the PSV Endhoven.
While this led the left foreign champion to wine and will be excluded for at least six months from the game, Louis van Gaal does not hope that Shaw can play again in this season.
The damage was caused by an unrecognizable attack by Héctor Moreno in 15 minutes after 20 years of age Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be released tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a young man who comes to Manchester United with 18 has a very hard time and then plays fantastically, and then that happens.
In the bathroom, he had a oxygen mask.
It's okay.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then it takes six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to have a red map and the connection of an elfmeter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the judge, did not punish the Mexicans.
Van Gaal argued that the Italian judge had been in trouble.
You can judge for yourself if I say that an elfmeter and a red map were fallible.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account said: "I thank you all for your messages. Words cannot describe how hard I am, my way to release now, I come back stronger."
About this: Manchester United leads to the loss of Luke Shaw at the PSV landing
With the European Mastership in France, the English Ombudsman has an additional invitation to attend until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It's a very bad injury."
If a player with this type of injury leaves the place, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our player to harm a opponent.
Moreno experienced a bone break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland Mansion at the WM 2014.
"It's very difficult because it wasn't his intention to hurt the enemy, and if you hear that it's a very bad injury, it's not good," said Cocu.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball, which was in a different direction, so it looked as if he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital - after a football game by Chris Smalling.
Are you sure David Cameron The Lorax knows better?
It's a thing that all parents soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won't last long until you know it almost exclusively.
Well, maybe you're David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite childhood book, the Prime Minister for The Lorax, who appeared in 1971, decided to appoint Dr. Seuss' environmental building.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the company's SuperCamps website, and goes on: "Slowly, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book that I want to read to my children, because it always seems to give us a picture or a message that we've missed before."
Everything is beautiful and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron describes the operation of the book, is re-submitted a series of content of the 2012 film version, adding the new characters and details to increase the relatively short original text.
"In the midst of the surrounding town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a product, a young man named Ted, the heart of Audrey, hopes to win the daughter of his dreams by seeing her desire to see a real tree," one read. Dr. Seuss, whose true name Theodor Seuss Geisel was heard and died in 1991, but he was completely unknown.
Whether this is not yet suspicious: The text presented by Cameron reads partly like the composition of the Lorax film, which is presented on the website of Movie Database, and begins: "In the surrounding town of Thneed-Ville, where everything is art and even the air is a product, a young man named Ted, the heart of Audrey, hopes to win the daughter of his dreams."
Although he is willing to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little trusted in the operation of the book. Here a young man is hearing how the local environment is affected by the money-generating, falling trees, Thneed strikers, despite the protests of the so-called Lorax, an amazing, fast-paced being, "that speaks in the name of the trees," is being replaced.
Most likely such a relatively low PR assignment was delegated to an assistant, who did not read the Lorax 20 times after one child.
A Downing Street speaker said the text was probably coming from Cameron's selection agency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text of Cameron's staff was delivered, but no further direct comments were made.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exit from England's men, but it's still hard.
To stand in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the framework chosen by England for the tour, a repetition of the 3-0 test series is not on my map.
I wouldn't close a look at the outside.
Alastair Cooks Page may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting exhibition, and the community spirit is strong; they will not take any vows from 2012, just a young positive approach.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin-bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
About this message: Adam Lyth separates from the England test framework and is replaced by Alex Halles.
The decision to release Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult to analyse for me as his chief coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no questionnaires at Joe Root, for example, and this led to the nomination, because - and I said this before - players are their own best choices.
Long ago, you had extended Lyth's course, but he had control over his own destiny.
If he looks forward to further run for Yorkshire, another chance will come.
The English trainer Trevor Bayliss praised his stand, even though he did not have such good results, and that does not surprise me; he is, above all, a team man.
The question of how long a test matchman gets to set his character is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and outdoor games.
The only thing you can find was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - as Lyth in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Halles comes in here, and he's a fighter I appreciate very much.
He's an X-factor cricket player, what we saw in Yorkshire early this season when he reached 236 against us at a Trent Bridge place, what happened to us.
At least he has to get the same opportunities as he has before him, but of course this depends on the manpower in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of not being able to catch up with Cook, what would bring an extra spin-bowler and get four quicks, grew up, and I had nothing to do with it.
I don't see why a fighter can't beat there, and this left-hand man has already shown that he's a devil killer of cricket players.
Moen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for her, and there is no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He's got three hundred runnings right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the frame as back-up spinner, and in my limited relationship with him, he has impressed me as a young man.
People may see his statistics - average 31 with the shooter and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there are no large numbers of backpants that raise their hands and trainers have chosen for young people.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the men, England has made several dark additions to the trainer's table.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a test game consultant could be a master Cup.
He is one of the next cores of the game, which will bring a lot of experience, because he has played against all conditions and attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white bullet phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the setup.
I have always felt that he has been created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and how Mahela has ideas that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the surrounding cabin, even if the messages are in accordance with the above mentioned.
Collisions teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, will not be used at the One Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team makers do not determine the schedule.
And you have to think that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not easy to make.
Brexit stock (Brexit = UK increase from the EU) could be won if the economy is in a fleet by 2017
David Camerons, an unambiguous re-negotiated strategy to hold Britain in the EU, will be put to more hardship every day, even without the choice of the great Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbins to lead a lab or the TUC, which is severely fragmented by Europe on the Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their corbins and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some Member States are deeply involved in various crises, such as the EU is now, and not always because of their own debt, the United Kingdom itself's agenda with broken terms and complex contractual changes that most of them do not want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it would also not like this if they threatened social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, writing at summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, making a photo of themselves before a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wishes to go outside the UK within the EU's target - "Let us not alone with France," says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short-term ministers and officials have arrived in some major cities to the point where they do not care whether we are staying or going.
Special Chancellor Angela Merkel is a member of Germany, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as it has happened in the long-term exits like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Frances François Hollande looks at his re-election or his replacement in 2017.
He's also a refreshing force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a link.
It is difficult to imagine that they will be cut off a leg to help the Selfie Brittes whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK - something they do not want, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Hence, some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful comments, all in the SNP-style, during the 2017 UK referendum campaign, to speed up the Brexit process, my friend is confused.
"The renegotiation was a pleasure" and "Great Britain won no value from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how radically the Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU sceptics are the oligarchy of the press barones, as they were during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, who supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can hardly remember Boris Johnson, the Erz-Euro opportunists who made a name as a "EU-Grade banana" correspondent in Brussels in the early 1990s.
In all his folly, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of the tax-inflamming shouts, telephone hacking countries and the pseudo non-residents who have most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same about her, but found that if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you're going to share better bananas in order to get rid of him, instead of being his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum, because Blair had laid down the principle of the non-adopted EU constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters who opened a door to him in 2005.
The press didn't give him that either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly clip on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needed time for me - seems in danger to repeat Neil Kinnocks Boycott Murdoch strategy of the 1980s, a mistake at the time and today.
It can last, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC-Sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbys' official position in Europe is - I stress it kindly - in development.
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukips are traditional blue-coloured trends and the wildest films of Torys Small Englishism, probably everyone can say yes.
It's what Hillary "A Ben, but No Ben" said on the radio and on TV this week when the pathfinder fought in him, did not allow Corbys to appoint the exorcising John McDonnell as an evil idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his old father tried to be disloyal to his colleagues at work, without going too far and losing his office job.
Hillary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to remain "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, and what JC told his colleagues and members after all reports on their closing session at the Montagband.
Whatever you want to know about Corbyn's reputation - think it even motivated me - News-Disciplin stays in the time of TV around the clock and above all things in the strudel of social media, a frenzy of paranoia and Verrat.
It is right that Cameron should not give a free card for Europe, which allows him to support Labor in the referendum campaign for a sense of self-evidentness, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbins are not just a question of esoteric discussion among left dissidents, for which the narcism of the small difference is a central principle of doctrinal disputes.
As with his majority testimony to Nato - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that the JC does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their predecessors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose political capital, - they also have mystical voters - to make concessions to the British if all of this can be pointless?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a reduction in the cost of the Tory government's power, where I was reminded at the start of something called the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts critically report by Public Health England on e-cigarettes
The claim of a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking was caused by a meeting of 12 people, in part by links to tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) concluded Lancet by criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "principal report" last month and described it as a "exclusive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the availability of data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A leading article in Lancet's medical journal last month hits the "extraordinary wind base" based on the PHE's most important conclusion.
Two other researchers wrote in BMJ and asked whether the claims "to build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expected that the claim of PHE that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were invited to develop a model for a multi-phase decision analysis (MCDA) to lead their views on the damages of various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose business leaders should have received prior to British American Tobacco Mettel (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the BAT's references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting said to receive funds from an e-cigarten manufacturer, but not the funding he was supposed to receive after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International added.
The reasons for the selection of the members of the panel are not provided, but these include several well-known e-zigarten champions, some of which also provide industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The meeting also took part in the management of PHE tobacco.
The research work of the group "remarkably exists", that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damages of most products at most criteria", writes McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the claims of PHE that "there is no evidence that e-cigarettes have been used as a way to smoke children or non-smokings" have been early.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, said that the claims of BMJ have already been answered.
He said, "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
Every second live-long smoker dies in his search.
All evidence shows that the health risks of e-cigarettes are very low compared to this, but that we still have to study the long-term effects.
PHE has the clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what is not, especially if there is so much public objection to the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die annually from a smoking disease, and smoking costs the national health system two billion £ per year.
By presenting clear evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking is a part of our national responsibility.
BBC should specify EastEnders, says former Head of Channel 4
The former president of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for Hit-shows like Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the function fee should only be used to make the type of programs not sent by other UK senders.
He criticised the BBC to place public-law programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in a strongly disputed time window against the most popular shows of their rivals and messengers such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director General Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had been trying to contact the BBC for six years with channel 4 without success.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are being ordered or sent, which would also be clearly shown by non-subsidised rivals," Johnson said to the Overhouse Communications Committee during his study on the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the function fee, which I do not hold for a medium or long time for a good idea, you should at least produce it on programs that do not make others or order it.
They send The Voice in a first-class window because they want to reach the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's natural nonsense.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax programme is funded, which could also be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, East Enders is a further, additional level of own production.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see how this should be public-law television.
I don't think this would ever reduce the BBC.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, led by channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC should be on the hunt for evaluations "because of the ambitions of the people working there and because they believe this is the best way to ensure long-term support."
His comments to the BBC's most popular broadcasts are what the former leader of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart contract in Edinburgh in 2003, suggested that BBC Shows should be sold as East Enders.
Johnson said that the more public-law Nischen programs "should go to BBC4 where you can't measure the audience quite well, but they can carry out their tasks, and they can argue if they go to their seemingly-defensive missions for the correction of £4 billion, "Well, of course, we have created all these obscenaries that no one has seen."
They put them in a window of time in which no one ever wanted to see them.
Johnson said to the Committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system with regard to conditions, who can get the best value out of it.
Of course you all think, we all think that you get a big value for £150 per year here, but for people who are a lot of money for the £150, I wonder if that's true because they don't consume much from the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5 Chief David Elstein, who also attended the Committee on Tuesday, requested that the BBC verify their Reithian mission, "to inform, format and maintain".
He said that only a few of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said there were 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and they should take an example to the public television operators in Australia and Canada in "information, clarify and maintain".
On the question of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the proms he said that only one handball will be shown on the television and enter trade alliances to make everything available online.
Sonogenetics can control brain cells by shell waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment they are directed with clipping pulses.
Scientists have developed tumors with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of shellwells.
The Winnipeg nematodes change the direction at the moment when they are exposed to loud pulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The pulses work through the activation of motoreuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
More on this subject: Read and write hierarchical activity with light
The researchers said that the ants showed the power of a new process called Sonogenetics, at the ultrasonic level, to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the process of one day could replace deep-stimulation, an invasive process that produces electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Fadenwurmers usually don't react to ultrasonicall, but Chalasani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with microscopic air bubbles.
The blasts, found out, strengthen the ultrasonic waves that then penetrate into the Worms.
The enhanced ultrasounds work on structures called TRP-4 ioncanals and are found in the membranes of some of the stem cells.
The shell waves affect the opening of these ion channels and activates the cells they are assigned, such as a Natural Communications report.
In order to create ultrasonic-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically changed the walls so that some of her motor neurons carry TRP-4-ioncanals.
When it applies ultrasonic to the changed creatures, the shell waves are strengthened by the microbliches and are transferred to the walls where they activate the modified motor neurons.
The process has some similarities with optogenetics, a slowing tool that allows scientists to activate neurons with impulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics might have some advantages with this technique.
In contrast to light, which must be sent to the desired place in the brain at an optical phase, low frequency ultrasound tissue can be transmitted without stopping and can thus be sent to the brain from above to the damage.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the intended human neurons temporarily random for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-produced cells, he added.

The announcements of the British arms trade in arms
View Amnesty International Anti-Waven Messen Video.
Squeeze killer drones!
Feet gels depleting bees!
Streubomben!
And electroshocks that cause painful pain, but don't leave a trace behind!
The joyous voices and the Cartoon images leave no doubt that this display of the world's largest arms trade is a battle-famous parody produced by Amnesty International to bring the British Government's readiness to shed weapons on a repressive regime over the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the exCel Centre in London Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are to be seen at bus stations and in the U-road trains and require a second look.
"An important announcement: Do you drive from 15 to 18 September with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) read in the fonts of the London Underground and the DLR-line marks that turn to the picture of a Panzer.
In September, a shadow of weapons dealers will drive with the DLR ... Customers will be asked to help at the end of the weapon trade.
The 300 posters are from artists who have performed their work at the museum for graphic designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped in the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6 £ package of bus keys, which is claimed to "Access to about a third of the bus service facilities on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this poster "Vandalism" funny.
One of the parishes produced by Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and a doctor at the University of Essex, artists will be critical and will try to bring political work to the public outside of galleries.
Many artists engage with activists in protest movements at work and note that they have to work outside the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-weapon trade plates is the pendler in the U-Bahn.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours over Facebook and was created by the VCCP advertising agency, which works jointly with the graphics and voiceover artist, who also works free of charge.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was surprised by the style that prevailed around the advertising for the weapon trade - through an exCeL calendar lecture, and he thought, "We give them the campaign to avoid them."
They played with the finding of a more realistic firm application, but "inflation with bright colors and animation remains stronger."
"They have done a fantastic job by helping us to force awareness about the sale of illegal foot-and-mouth devices on the show," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is a pledge by the British Government and the guarantee that foot-and-mouth equipment will not be dealt with illegally in front of our house.
Perhaps the most creative art around the weapon trade comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors perform fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Sab reveals an order from the US Army about "the AT4CS RS excluded from the accused."
This is part of a "only-formed fetish head that delivers outstanding effects within the target."

Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Homes
Ten years ago, I went to a student home as a self - forgotten 19-year-old, still believing in Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the alarming faces of those I have raised - and the numerous long-term complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The entry into student homes is quite nervous to the point where it is completely boring.
It's funny to be black: Tell people where you're coming, where you're taking Saturday year, where you're on Corbyn and why you're " honestly said Marmite doesn't like yet, because seriously, boys, it's just a HaHAHA Hefe Extract, I'm in my room."
Take it through.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It slows the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like instead of those you wouldn't talk to, even if your Wimpers were burning in fire and these fires would be gone.
Let people go.
The rooms of people are often transformed into drinking recipes, film-night event resorts and municipal meeting points, but they are also the places where people draw themselves and direct their undergrowth.
About: Don't think about starting a relationship with the Union
Introverts receive a serious treatment at the university.
Your room should be a shelter, but many students' homes form a space-to-room-bummel culture, which is friendly and social and can lead to a lifelong friendship.
That can be the hell for someone who's trying to get caught.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to leave to get back the energy I've needed for the interaction with you."
Try to spy when a commilitone of company is created - and send him a text message instead.
Hang up: Don't do it.
A kernel in my student homes had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Close friendship with the back.
Since you start the union at the top of the back-manie, the key to the doors of people is to introduce yourself with a speaker full of Brownies, less rare than the greeting of the 1950s "Come to the neighborhood, I have brought you something back. So, and now laugh if I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering home-made cures is a good way to close friendships.
Your residents feel obliged to stay and may eventually associate your face with a nice surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a competent baker.
Bad mixed pumps of honey, sugar and fat lead people to sleep when you attack.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, the neck of the hips is a thick steel, but is it the take of a troupe milk for your tea too?
Check with the milk owner.
The chances are that they say to serve themselves even if they cook inside.
If someone throws your stuff, it's embarrassing, and you have my feelings - but try to be balanced as my resident who added a spray to their milk to punish the dibe.
She's in prison now.
They should not make any noise, the people depend on sleep or work.
It's not just about being a decent person, but that you belong in the real sense of the word to the people who sit in the glasshouse.
A girl on my floor asked her neighbors if they had anything to do with getting a drum and bass a little lower, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They responded to it with even later music.
When they finally stopped at 5 o'clock, they kindly let their neighbors sleep for two hours before leaving their own music, closing their door and entering into their three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse accidentally entered the same student home?
Would it not be far too sad if you were to keep a partner for your future spouse, stay away from her, get away from her again and then have to see each day and maybe live the way she takes all her friends together?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a warm neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to make your living a little more meaningful.
At the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has left his key in his locked room, the border between a cloud and mobbing is better than it seems.
A good string is funny, but it only takes a moment until it gets to the boomerang.
Share a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but don’t waste any room with toothpasta and shampoo.
Close your door, and place your keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the refrigerator - but don't touch their property on the deck more than twice.
Linehouses for refugees, lonely, gardening servers
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds in the central corner of the French rain house for people who don't have much money.
So about refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the single mother and the generous provider."
"I'll show you how you can build even more valuable and good today," says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will be forced into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly a cheap living room can be created: He builds a house for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be forced into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The massive infertility in containers or tournament halls has no sustainability.
Because the people remain a great part of this.
In view of the refugee stream, we also need adequate living space in the coming decades.
A completely balalal, three-six-six-square house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house needs at least a place.
It facilitates integration.
That's different when you bring people into the living quarters.
Each of the six houses built just in the pilot project consists of three housing units for each of four asylum seekers.
Each apartment has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily restructured according to their respective needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters living area per house runs to 184,000 euros, without any rent.
That's amazing.
Six months' time for the building.
That's right.
Have the construction regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: I've had my project properly.
In particular, it is always complicated by the sorceived damocle's strength of special construction and the regulation of the place of employment.
That's awful.
It is still undercover, who creates three apartments in a row house, needs at least three seats.
It's just in the cities there's a lack of space for it.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the inhabitants react to their project?
Gildner: There were some who suggested that I create luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which definitely does not agree.
But don't you force the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: The truth is, we had a tree in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments were built that could hardly afford more.
My project has the message, the normal people also need a living room.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the generous servant.
I'll show you how you can still build something valuable and good today.
That's why it's going.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and first worked with environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple updates are published
The new operating system can be requested by going to the configuration application, typing "General" and then selecting "Software update".
If it is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after installation because they receive an error message announcing that the "software update" has failed.
To solve the problem, it is recommended that users either wait until the storm returns or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it unlikely by cutting the update. It will also be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them as soon as the process is finished.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is loaded during the update or is located near a charging device so that the battery is loaded.
If the load is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone may be off half-way and this could lead to an interruption of the update.

You should also ensure that before your download you have reviewed our checklist of all things to prevent things from going wrong and protecting themselves if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much clearer personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes, acceleration and repair the operating system.
Rosbergs only device: Volle Attack
Nico Rosberg knows in the fight about the WM title in Formula 1 against his clear Mercedes team colleague Lewis Hamilton only one more device: "Volle Attack".
The WM-second stressed before the start in the decisive seven oversea race, "that I don't have to lose anything anymore".
53 points will be separated by the Vice-President of the World in Singapore on this Sunday by the title defender and the twoofach-Champion Hamilton.
The British has already won seven of the previous twelve seasons and has also taken the Flylight Grand Prix in the city as a favorite attack.
In 2009 and last year, 30 years old Britain was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city will have an impact on Singapore's great price, it is still unclear.
Since the day, a dark clock has been on the city, exposed by fire on the nearby island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Schachclub has a prominent member
The chess club "Schatfriend Bad Kissingen" has joined another member in its ranks three months ago, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who held more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselmann is a champion of the Federal Service Cross 1. Class and honour citizens of the city of Espelkam and Lübecke.
The Schachclub in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a donation, the president named Alfred Klein.
It is possible, therefore, to include players who cannot contribute to the membership.
Youth work and talent should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes to see the membership of the chess club as well as friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-White" as an expression of his relationship with the city.
Quartiers office is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Antonistif Old Centre have been brought together under the direction of the Social Foundation and opened a new station at the Graph-Stuffenberg Square.
In addition to consultations, you can also attend courses there.
The Social Foundation is seen from the mountains in the city.
Exactly said to the Graph-Stuffenberg Square.
A new Quartiers office was recently opened there.
Here, immediately in addition to the shopping market, seniors and consultants will receive information on issues such as care insurance or health care services.
Over the years, we have agreed with our ambulance service that often employees are allowed alone.
There are many questions about this.
"And many of the services of the casinos will not rarely be applied, as the complexity of the insurance is not yet understood," explained the new landlord Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonist and the Civil Hospital and the ambulance service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new Quartiers office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
This is where the Saludis was taken with the boat.
Therefore, additional offers such as stress prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment can be used.
The offers from the centre of seniority and the Saludis are ideal.
Saludis stands for prevention, precautions and Reha.
"The Senior Care and Care Centre", heike Riedel, director of Saludis, described.
The reason for opening the new quarter office in the city is seen by both business leaders in particular in the demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentral infrastructure in the individual parts of Bamberg in the future impossible.
In addition, the mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) pointed out that in the event of accession, the Quartet's office is also dedicated to the association of the elderly: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and they are being regularly included in the program".
As a result, the Social Foundation has made a big contribution that older people can live independently and well in their trusted environment.
The district office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 o'clock, Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 o'clock and Friday from 10 a.m. to 12 o'clock.
Entry by Bamberg against Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
It is now official: After the rehearsal work at the FC Park Stadium for the game entry Bamberg against the third list of Würzburger Kickers was not yet established, it was now established as the term on 6 October.
The encounter of the FC intrecht Bamberg in the eastern end of the Bayern Football Topopocals against the third list of FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finalised.
It will be played on Tuesday, 6 October, at 19 a.m. in Bamberger Fuchspark Stadium.
"We are glad that we know now that when the game goes over the stage, we now have planning security," says FCE teamman Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the card promotion sale that is currently under way.
It's especially for our men to play against a third party.
We therefore look forward to many visitors, and this is not without reason, because flux games already have a special trip.
Around the last 16 men, the FC entry Bamberg 2010 entered the area list by winning 1 FC Oberhaid (3:1) and going home against the regional list 1. FC Sweyinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives EUR 5000 and qualifies for the first round of the DFB Unionspokal 2016/2017.
Title Defender is a third-party SpVgg sub-haching.
Wiener Architect Karl Mang died 92 years old
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna's architecture, is dead.
He died on 5 September at the age of 92, as told by the artist house on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist house loses a member of honor and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was in the expedition.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied during and after World War II at the Technical University in Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but also as a teacher, writer and institutional leader.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute for Formification.
In the 1980s, he was assigned to the Austrian Theater Museum in Vienna, Hofburg, and to the construction of the Palais Lobkowitz Palace.
Park punishment: Tim Wiese is a police officer with money
Ex-Footballer Tim Wiese is in Bremen.
Foßballer was once engaged, however, Tim Wiese, former national hero in Germany and at Bremen and Hopenheim, Wrestler.
30 kilogram muscle mass is intended to have given its own statements in the past two years.
However, he did not give it intellectually.
In Bremer Innstadt, Wiese was able to cut the hair when he saw out a parking lot for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
In the meantime, Wiese withdrew from the business, insulted the officials, and punished her with the fall of money before her feet, as the "image" quote reports.
In Bremen City, the preamble is confirmed, but the consequences for the unusual event are still not clear.
"The case is still under investigation," it is from Bremen City.
Only then will choose whether or not the way will be shown.
Panama's authorities destroyed 4500 Marihuana plants
The fertile soil and the rain forest-type climate of the Isla del Rey are best suited for the soiling of the Marihuana plants.
For three days, the Panamanian authorities have detonated 4500 plants and burned them.
Men hunt on 17-year-old Afghans
The police are looking for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday, at 23.45 a.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden to Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghane, followed the police's two friends in a distance of about five metres and called on them to wait for him.
At this point, the group was located at the height of the bft tank station.
On the ground of the tank station, there were also three people standing.
One of these men now screamed at the young men and beat him with the fist in his face.
The victim suffered a nasal fracture and was severely bleeding from the nose.
When two of his friends broke up and broke down on the shoulder, he left his victim first.
From his friends, the wounded young man was now taken home.
The tasker followed the group with a pkw to their apartment and went on demonstration several times over there.
When you could not see the vehicle anymore, the wounded went to the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was caught again by the shooter and another man.
With the help of a shot, one looked at the face and the shoulder of the victim.
The injured had to be brought to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only one vague description of the product.
One of the men was about 180 meters tall.
The second climber was to be about 1,65 meters high and was dressed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and indicators to report under telephone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes the practice of field housing and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gogoll and Frank Müller (left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Feltehausen.
In addition, Mr. Bernd Bormann, Mrs. Uta Seim-Swartz and Mr. Asendorfs, Mr. Heinfried Kabbert, are pleased.
In many places there are no doctors in the country - Asendorf has been lucky: there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Feltehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen is at rest, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still with a half-place on his side in the coming months.
After a construction phase, Müller reopened the practice on 12 October until he invests 310000 euros in space at St. Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first glance when the field houses of Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongall, who now graduated from their vocational training in the World Hospital, also wanted to improve their practice in the next year.
"We always had in the backyard that the muellers would fit well in this practice," says Dr. Ursel Feltehausen and laughing.
"When it was so far, I just called her."
The couple Müller liked the idea of performing their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The closeness and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years."
As a result, he also sees soon to be his own boss.
And that's how it turned out to be that the Muellers bought the house with the practice.
They will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There, the two-fold family father, Frank Müller, also grew up, followed by his medical study in Hanover in several medical practice stations as well as in the hospital houses in Sullingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently active as an officer in Sulingen, in addition to being appointed to lead notarzt in the Diefolz circle in 2009 and is committed honorably to the DRC-Preparation Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September the practice is prepared for the new chief.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen worked as a housewife, his cat's earring (internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internalists, want to go down as house doctors.
"The Endoscope comes out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongall.
After the construction, the rooms will look modern.
We will offer more ultrasonic surveys, as well as long-term and service ECGs and need a more speech room.
In addition, the EDV will be fully updated.
A total of EUR 50000 is received by the Müllers within the framework of a programme of aid from the countryside (EUR 25000) and from the municipality (12500) and the Community (12500).
"This shows how proud and delighted we are that the practice will be continued," stressed mayor Bernd Bormann.
About 2000 patients call Silvia Müller-Gongall every quarter in the practice of Feltehausen, in the northern German average practice there are about 500.
There's another house practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller: The apotheque remains according to Ursel Feltehausen in Asendorf.
If no follower had been found, they would have gone.
Those who visit Müller's speech hour also continue to look, above all, in confidence: takes over the seven medical exchangers and the cleaning power of the field houses.
With their divorce ending in Asendorf, the doctors have been practicing there for 30 years.
"In the beginning, we had only two rooms," recalls Ursel Feltehausen.
A little wehmut has been expecting her for a long time.
"But we still live in Hohenmoor, and many patients will see more and more," says the Internist.
Your husband adds, "We have a 6000 square meters base piece."
"Bisher, I always put myself in front of gardening, and now it could be different."
In addition, the couple has two singles and they like to travel.
Croatia: "We leave the refugees through"
"Now the border controls will also be high at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain parallel to this.
After all, it is clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum can also make this "self-conscious".
The supply and security of humans are in the forefront.
Of course, it is also "that there is a great need for signaling," said the Minister.
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, nor over the Austrian-Slovenes border.
There is a need for a controlled procedure.
Croatia expects "Corridor" - Slovenia to reject
The Croatian Government had previously informed Slovenia that it would also want to allow refugees to travel to Austria and Germany and, under the circumstances, also create corridors for refugees.
However, this was not the case with Interior Minister Vesna Györkós Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia will increasingly intensify the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary.
The border with Croatia is already well controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister stressed, Slovenia does not want to break its refugee boundaries.
"Every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," said Györkós Znidar.
As the Croatian Government said, the first refugees had already tried to travel to Eastern Croatia at the border crossing Tovarnik/Sid to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to attack her in the nearby Maesfelds.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been regularly introduced in the Croatian Tavarnik.
It is mainly about Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country was numbered with about 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo to the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would turn Croatia towards the road, reporting Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade, however, argues that it is to show people that it is to introduce certain routes: "We can, we can or will do this," he said.
According to the media reports, in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city of Sid, another bus would be expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria by Germany
The Insassins had been on their way all night from the Macedonian border about 500 kilometers away from Serbia.
"We've heard that Hungary had an advantage, so the police told us we should go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel further through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
As a result, it could actually now be the foretold distribution of the former Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Mazedonian-Serbia-Serbia-Serbia-Serbia-Serbia-Serbia-Serbia-Serbia-Serbia-Serbia-Serbia.
Croatia: "Special opportunities for border control"
Croatia's Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country has prepared for the case of a strong flow of refugees plans for possible exceptional situations.
He did not mention in detail, but he pointed out that Croatia as a non-schengen member had "exclusive possibilities for border control".
There are strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has since 2007, EU partners have been giving the country a good witness to the standard of border controls since 2007.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees continue to arrive behind the Hungarian border.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the last night on the Horgos border crossing, leading to Russia.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Bakki Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to move to the Croatian border, it is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to slow down on Wednesday morning at a local scene in Horgos: He held the debate on alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed.
It would not be very high at this time.
It is still impossible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helping migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already started to distribute to refugees maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not inevitable: in parts of the border area, there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war, which are still unknown.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of miners had been sent to the border region.
Börsen hacker: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok is supposed to have heard a call from cyber criminals, which is expected to have been refocused in unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Market Wired and PR Newswire.
Insider businesses should be made available to the financial markets with the information provided.
In this way, the researchers received over 100 million dollars as a whole.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our borders will eventually be arrested," says the SEC Communication.
The proceedings against 32 other defendants continued in the case.
Most of the defendants come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The targets should have been active in the United States as well as in Eastern Europe.
Ökumenische Hospizife Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
Around the manheimer Paradeplatz, government operates.
People cause their concerns, partly rapid steps, partly mildly burning.
They control the two stations of the manhouse car salon at the Parade Square.
Stop the city streets.
Pulsier, beautiful life with a magnificent herbsson appearance and in the middle of four big tables each with the headline "Before I die."...
The Occidental Hospice has focused on this action on its 20-year-old population and is faced with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, that's why we went through action in the city and under the people," says Josephine Lamber.
The leader of the Ökumen hospitality is also present to the passengers for questions and conversations, as well as to the honourable staff.
While sometimes a Passant Spontan comes to the credit and the sentence "see my life", "read", "walk through the USA", "stop the war" or "don't suffer for long", still others are short, read, say sentences such as "I am not yet" and then go on.
Little discussions about action, about life, dealing with death continue to develop on the edge.
Peter Hübinger is also right in front of the place.
"Only if I make it clear that for me the end of this world will ever come to an end, I can live responsiblely," says the Director of the Diaconian Work Mannheim, who is together with the Caritas Association of the Ocumenic Hospices.
Therefore, this public action would be good for 20 years.
The fact that not everyone wants to talk on the tables publicly, however, is understandable, is finally a very personal matter.
The subject of death and death was still held in front of Tabus, so the experience of Josephine Lamber, although the optimistic movement has contributed much in recent years to the opening of the people.
An appreciation shared by Angelika Godefroid.
The dying and suffering companion is one of the honourable staff of the first hour.
Faced with the subject through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to become involved in the death assistance.
When the Ökumenic Hospijs were looking for help by calling honorary, she reported immediately and was in the process of setting up in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 officials - 43 women and two men - accompanying the concerned and members in private homes, hospitals, nursing homes and in the hostel Sankt Vincent.
They're all carefully shot.
Angelika Godefroid can deal well with her task and experience and experience.
"I see the life of another waiter, keep it affordable and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of an Ambulatory Ocumen hospitality is free of charge and free of charge.
The financial support of the hospitals and donations of members and associations enables training as well as training and supervision of survivors of death and grief.
Every two years, training is offered for new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now displayed in the house of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Further personal wishes can also be noted on Postcards.
FedEx results mixed, financial prospects reduced for 2016
FedEx reports surprising results for the last quarter, and the supplier-Gigant reduced its profit-effectiveness over a whole year due to the weak demand for freight services and higher costs in its underground transport service.
The company also said it was planning to host about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this point, FedEx announced last year that the company wanted to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday time.
The stock fell by 2.5 per cent in Premarket Hand 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the business year, which ends in the next May, 20 percent less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected a question from FactSet $10.84.
The lower outlook comes in spite of the price increases averaged by 4.9 per cent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher subsidies for underground transport of heavy and large packages that will be raised from November.
The company said that it was still expected that the result would rise over the previous year due to cost reduction, higher revenue and growth in the online hand.
Charman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "produces solid income if it takes into account the weak economic conditions expected, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The holiday employment plans were announced one day later than that of the River UPS, which is planning to install 90,000 to 95,000 additional labour forces, i.e. the same number as in the last year.
In the quarter, which ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The result of each share was $2.42 per share, almost $2.44 per share, which predicted 12 analysts questioned by Zacks Investment Research.
The turnover rose by 5 percent to 12.3 billion dollars.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks expected $11.23 billion.
In recent years FedEx has had to list a decline in international priority transmission, which led to the movement in its unit of express transmission.
But the tree in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover in underground transport increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was mainly flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result was lower labour costs in the freight business.
In premarket hand, about an hour before opening, FedEx shares fall to $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $1150.15.
On Tuesday, they ended with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record on 11 June.
At its most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserve Strategyes spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduran Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time to cut the lead for the first time almost a decade.
Looking over them at the end of the two-day meeting hall, there is a wall of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are going to put the economic interests of the nation ahead of everything else.
The Central Bank has a double order from the Congress: maximising US employment and prices are stable here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too serious to predict it. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to start, from the unambiguous approach to the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most of the economic data show that they are growing in a solid manner, the latest turbulences in the global financial markets could make it difficult for the already predictable Fed representatives to increase this flexibility by adding the federal loan interest rate - and it is only a quarter of a point.
"It is obvious that the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they have observed," said Lindsey M. Piegza, the chief economist at the company McLerstifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think, if they were looking for a condition not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty about the global market is about to be sufficiently justified to continue," she said.
There is no consensus on what will be done by the fed, which will ensure the financial market itself.
About half of the economies that were questioned shortly before Bloomberg had predicted an increase in interest this week.
The financial markets, however, expect to wait for the fed, with a key indicator that shows only a 30% chance for an increase.
This indicates a decline in the share market if the fat increases the rate, it is because the strategies slow down the damage by promising that further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial averaged 228.89 points or 1,4 % to 16,599.85.
The action was resolved by expectations that the Fed-Politics will maintain the set this week, said John Lonski, the chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the flag had the seats at this time," he said.
If she did, "she had to go very far in her statement to slow down the financial markets so that she didn't panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest would slow the financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the liver is being treated.
Another month ago, the fed appeared on a good way to raise the rate of 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow deterioration of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States.
Yellen had said in the morning and in the morning that this year despite the complaints of Liberals that more economic progress would be needed, she expected an increase in the rate.
Although the creation of jobs in August was slow, the improvement in the labour market was strong this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the last month, the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the fever is considered to be full employment.
Pay increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although the inflation continued under the annual rate of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can manage higher interest rates and need them because of pressure on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economic leader at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets all over the world came together in the last month after China had assessed its currency.
In May, the Dow Jones Industrial averaged more than 16% of its highest level, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would cause global growth.
The market has gained something this month, where the Dow is now about 10% below the May height.
For Fed representatives, market turbulence affects the complex calculation when the interest is to be increased.
"If the events on the financial markets and the reports about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks, they would have taken the trains at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and an former U.S. notation Bank.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least a month to get the effects better in the grip.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be, and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the flock, so they should not be involved in their decision-making process.
But in the end, Fed became the world's currency authority.
The influence of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
The only indication of the former leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the fed could "get its monetary expansion" was that the confusion was resolved around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Her decision finding is "more art than science," said Zachary carabell, director of the global strategy for the management of assets by Investnet Inc.
Jeffrey Laker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, observed this month that "the liver has a history of over-reactions on financial market movements which appear to be not related to the economic fundamental data."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee which is used to raise interest, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce their leadership by 0.75 percentage points at three meetings "with a very limited impact on growth in the United States", Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed representatives withdrew these cuts.
The Fed should focus on the aspects of financial stability only during a difficult crisis such as the 2008 collapse of the market, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England.
The latest turbulences don't come close to this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are rising," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it is changed, I do not think it should be anticipated.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/the warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that is also sold to the general public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/the warehouse is a central starting point and offers an amazing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and jewelry, furniture, religious beauty and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need motor oil.
The load is huge, and it takes about an hour to speed through the tracks.
If the whole shopping cart makes you hungry, there is a meal time for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and priced) in this shop is located near the boxes and has various options for taking care of it.
What's up here: Do you need something - something - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are priced and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai dressers, fruit and more.
The meat stick is extensive, as is the fish stick - the staff behind the teke will clean the fish and filtrate the fish, even if you want to.
A good part of the load is the mass relief department. Here you can find frozen Curry leaves, bitter melons and gallant, whole food, fish, rice blood and galleys, Swine-natural Darm, fish balsam, regional cheese, commercially prepared foods and more.
Who buys one here: restaurant owners and cooks, as well as individual families and individuals.
The wide range is suitable for cars and cables.
You can find it here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the box.
Where he is: The loading is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the border of Chinatown and the city of Innstadt - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has a private parking area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small life assistance for refugees
More and more refugees come to Germany this day.
To prepare you for a warm welcome, don't go without the commitment of countless noble assistants.
Also in Hoyerswerda there are a number of people who support the self-sufficient asylum-neglectors in the city.
They belong to Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with Leib and soul.
She still likes to be taught with her 74 lenses.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum competition house on the Dillinger Street.
There they help refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German.
Of course, this is all the other teaching than a right school.
Brazilian Padiatric Society Rio Grande promotes food for healthy styles
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS is trying to explain in a shocking way how important it is for women to eat during the summer. They do this with the presentation of images of babysitters that protect breast milk that are infected with the appearance of unhealthful foods.
Mother milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers are asked to increase their daily intake of calories to about 500 calories per day.
However, new research results indicate that higher calorie intake is not the only diet adjustment that mothers should take.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually concerns the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can adversely affect the immune system.
Exceptions to the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The Bernried Community Council approved the construction aid for the 2.3 million euro of its sports halls.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be flattened for solar system.
The plans for the long-term construction of tournament halls at Bernrieder Sports Lands will take a step forward: In the youngest community meeting, the proposed building project was rejected without major discussions.
The Panel had previously decided, inter alia, an application for a constructive "exemption" in respect of "freedom" from the appropriate construction plan.
The "exclusion" included the permit for a special form of mental construction.
Next, a "satellite layer with non-medium first and roof surface" should be created.
Background of the planning is the intended use of the roof for solar installations: "Therefore we get a wonderful big south together," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "freedom" went back to the mind-blowing, which was intended for energy reasons - other than in the construction plan - to be less than ten degrees.
This will significantly reduce the volume of the hall.
A "freedom" was therefore necessary because the design plan for the roofing does not allow "exclusions" - while Bernrieder is generally more restrictive in the application of exemptions.
However, there is no reversible project in the construction of the Tower Hall: "We will not create a precedent for this", says Steigenberger.
The tour hall building at the sports center is a community project of the community and the SV Bernried.
About 2.3 million euros are calculated at costs.
Grants are expected from school and broadband transport.
In the next process, the construction item is now presented for the 18 x 36 meters large hall to the Landatsamt.
Clinic Peißenberg is due to Schongau
The hospital Peißenberg should be closed earlier than planned - 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) will be the new medical director at Schongau Hospital.
The station as well as the majority of employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is the amazing plans of the hospital GmbH of the countryside, confirmed by the Landrätin Andrea Jochner-West.
However, a decision shall be taken by the Supervisory Board and it shall take effect on Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were to be implemented, almost 50 staff would continue to be employed at the hospital in Peißenberg.
The excessive majority will be transferred to Schongau with fishermen and the further existing internal station.
The rooms were available.
The workers who cannot follow Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim, such as Jochner-Weiss.
The staff members were informed of the plans.
The change has been resolved by Dr. Andreas Eder, who has been the medical director of Schungauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and has now changed to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
On the question of who should follow, Jochner-Weiß, the name "fisher" came to the game, which had already been explained, to take the lead from 1 October to switch with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau this means, in any case, an "assessment" and an extension of the offer in the "Internal Medicine" area.
Fischer is a specialist for heart surgeons and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized at the internal station on gastroenterological diseases.
During the next two years, fishermen and their team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, will lead both houses, until the next year the former hospital of the button, which has more than 35 beds, is to be completed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the landscape had planned this for 2018 when the current healing at the Hospital Weilheim was completed.
Landrätin Jochner-Weiß, also president of the Supervisory Board, sets aside plans to use the house that is owned by the Federal Republic of Germany in the future as an accommodation for Asylbeweber.
As the real estate goes on, Jochner could not say that there are several considerations.
There is currently a short-term care of the caritas and a day-care center.
"What's better could not happen to us, such an opportunity will not come back," said the fisherman about the quasi approach to the body, which was taken by the staff "positively and very understandingly."
A real perspective for the house in which the fisherman has worked as a chef for more than 30 years has not given it.
He had been asked by Mr Schungauer to take over the posts of the Medical Director.
The hospital Peißenberg (about 100 beds) was again threatened with closure in the past decades, divisions were closed, for example surgery and birth aid.
The Rhein-Neckar Lwöen's handballs are requested tonight (20.15 am) at the mountain HC.
The lead of the Bundesliga table is in Wuppertal, although the clear favorite, there is no chance of being superior.
In the past season, the bathers in the BHC were causing a painful fall and had something to do there.
Illustrating with two injuries at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were severely injured during their lunch break.
During the adventure on a Maisfeld at Pratau (Landkreis Wittenberg) several hunters were in use, as the police reported.
After a stroke a 63- and 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospitals.
The exact way it could get to the accident was, at first, unclear.
The criminal police are investigating it.
Missing 16-year-olds from Rhineland Pfalz Victims of Violence
A suspect led the police to the body of 16-year-olds missing from the Rhineland Pfalz since Saturday.
At the age of 20, the young were killed and their bodies were thrown into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old missing from Rhineland Pfalz has been a victim of violence.
The young woman's body was found on the day-to-day in Rockenhouses at Kaiserslautern, as reported by state government and police on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old, who has followed the statement and led the investigators to the foundation of the body, is also suspected.
The 16-year-old was reported missing on Sunday morning, after visiting a cemetery in Rockenhausen on the morning.
In the search for the young woman, the investigator first applied to personal objects of the victim.
Finally, in questioning the circle of friends and acquaintances of missing persons, an actual opinion was reached against the 20-years.
The supposed killer then led the police to a channel in Rockenhausen where the bodies were found.
The arrest gave the authorities a police response to the killing of 16-year-olds and placing the bodies in the canal.
The 20-year-old should be brought before the judge on Wednesday, who is charged by the investigator.
Conclusions on the immediate circumstances of the fact should provide further insights.
Refugees Need Accommodations: The study warns against housing accidents
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for a viable stay.
The pressure on the housing market is rising.
Social housing is a challenge.
The distribution attacks on the German housing market have begun a long time ago.
With the coming refugees and workers from the EU, more and more people are forced into a market that has already been abandoned in many major cities.
They compete with low income citizens around the last affordable apartments.
In order to cover the demand for affordable apartments, 400,000 new units need to be built every year by 2020.
As a result, a study is commissioned by the Association of Social Housing Buildings.
For comparison: This year, 220,000 units will be completed in Germany.
That's why 150,000 apartments are missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a place of residence.
Many then stood on the housing market and chose to stay in the long corners before the apartments.
According to Statistics Finland, however, in the last year, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not limited to increasing refugee numbers.
The study has also resulted in significant discrepancies in the housing policy in recent years.
Germany has set up a housing deficit, which will grow from year to year.
Currently, about 770,000 housing units have been missing in the balunga region, the author of the study is Matthias Günther.
Many professionals therefore lived in major cities forced into WG rooms.
Young adults remain unsatisfied in the "Hotel Mama" because of the flow on the housing market.
In the larger cities, the number of square meters per head has been reduced for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the "Social Housing Building" Foundation proposes a new start.
New incentives are to re-acquire the social housing building.
In this way, the basic employment tax could be suspended and the basic tax for assisted dwellings would be suspended.
In addition, according to the Union, attractive tax write-off options were needed.
The State Bank KfW's refugee accommodation support programme is already being implemented in cities and communities.
A good week after the start, €184 million had already been withdrawn from the Montagband with more than half of the available EUR 300 million.
The project could even be closed now.
Refugees are free of charge: Croatia and Slovenia direct Corridor
According to Hungary, virtually no more transit, since more and more refugees choose the road through Croatia.
Zagreb announces to provide the journeys through Slovenia to the north without holes.
The route is dangerous, though.
Croatia wants to understand with the neighboring Slovenia about setting up a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken with the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if it is necessary, we will organize a corridor," said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen area.
The EU country of Croatia is still not a Schengen country.
Following the closure of the Serbian-English border, hundreds of refugees were stopped in Croatia to reach Western Europe from there.
500 people have come across the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian TV provider RTL.
Hungary had set its borders for refugees on the morning.
New laws, which take effect on the same day, are far too often excessive for proper asylum procedures in Hungary.
Croatia wants to allow refugees to pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "They can travel, and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, there are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there were people who didn't want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police attacked the first refugees at Serbia's border to the EU-neighbourly Croatia in the morning.
Most of the media reports came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They arrived by bus as well as by taxis in the Serbian border city of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they had tried to get on foot across the green border to Croatia.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, however, refugees were not on the border.
The border crossing poses other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Mines are supposed to be a safe passage now.
After the border has been closed, there are no more refugees in Hungary.
On Tuesday, the police numbered 366 people.
Shortly before the end of Monday, it was still 9380.
The new Hungarian legislation introduces the overcrowding and damage to the border.
Therefore, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the Sudanese border city of Szeged.
The defendants have been sentenced to five years of imprisonment and expulsion from the country.
According to the immigration authority, on Tuesday the new "transit zones" set aside total of 94 asylum applications, of which almost all - 93 - of the most important Russian transition.
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 more refugees had stayed there.
Practically, however, no one else has a view of obtaining asylum in Hungary.
Serbia is a "secure third country".
Retired asylum seekers should be fired there.
Just a few hundred refugees were gathered before the Transit Zone in Russia.
In Russia, workers began to get up there.
They collected the powder that had left tens of thousands of people on the street in the past weeks.
Spergitters were built and one of the recorders was built in the border area.
To this end, no one wanted to go abroad.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria has reached only a few refugees.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
About 20,000 migrants remained in the country after government elections.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting on the road to Germany.
The transport of train from there to Germany was suspended on the morning at the request of the German authorities.
In Freelassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot.
Mayor is "Gistrandete" across the border
"We were working after the bridge party on Sunday with the room when suddenly ten people stood at the entrance of the tent," said Mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted the train to Passau.
Since Germany was surprised by the flight stream, due to the current, the train with Austria was in Vernstein Castle," Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the strands, along with two other aids and their cars across the border near Passau.
Before we sold the unexpected guests once, with juice and drinks.
We just said we'll take them with the car to Passau.
"That was understandable to us," said Stadler in the OÖN speech.
You were very grateful.
A man was not allowed to spend a large amount of money - 100 euros for the firefight.
"This has pleased us very much," said Stadler.
The stranded train passengers were on the Sunday afternoon in Wels from an ICE in a regional direction of Passau to try to cross the border after the recent announcement that the road traffic was introduced to Germany.
However, the regional train was cancelled in front of the border in Wernstein.
In Wernstein the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The bridge festival is unique to the Bayerian neighbors on Sunday, the days before a bi-Bird race, organized by the Union of Wernstein and Bayern from New York.
The fact that Victor Orbán is now sending thousands of visitors to us is a logical result of a apparent policy:
Instead of helping to build structures immediately in Russia to ensure humanity, our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly withdrawn the Hungarian Government's position in the German sphere of national socialism.
The leaders of this policy are not just those Austrians who are now faced with Chaotoic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees must also be determined that the "dead country", which they have invited and welcomed, is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge, in view of the continuing flows of refugees and the coming winter, to create human resources for asylum seekers.
And it will be even greater to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad on the search for 35,000 winter-lying quarters
Konrad has to make all his hands full with the delivery of refugees.
Christian Konrad is accustomed to having his word weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banks to establish quarters for thousands of refugees.
The Chaos in the first collection centre of Traiskirchen has already reached Konrad in the grip.
"We no longer have obscenities in Traiskirchen," he reported on his first success.
The delivery of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was also done without a large wave, Konrad said and praised the organizational "master performance".
The Ministry of the Interior spoke against a "crisisable situation".
In total, Konrad calculated a need of 85,000 quarters in this year.
In order to meet the number, another 35,000 accommodations must be found in the next week - 20,000 are to be provided by the countries, 15,000 by the League.
If there's more refugees, we can make it.
"But it's not a phase without soil," Konrad said.
He has already spoken with the Head of State.
They would have assured him that they would also create quarters for the coming refugees.
"In Upper Austria it's running well," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP mandater supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to explain how the church will help.
Great expectations are also placed by the asylum coordinator in the ORF action "Help like us".
On the platform, private persons can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
In addition, you hope for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier criticised yesterday the standards for the introduction as "very high".
In times of need it may not be that the quadrilateral must contain a certain height of the handle holder or the size of the light.
For an extended period of time, "Not standards" must apply.
In contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, Konrad is well-founded with his experience.
I am an older gentleman who is not told in the face of the truth.
It was his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cause the Republic to bear any costs, as they themselves declare.
They want to increase the number of employees to three to four.
It was not yet successful in its own neighborhood search.
Konrad wanted to establish a container at the Stephansplace as an office.
However, there are obvious problems with the approval.
Linz requires a better division
Before opening urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center for the provision of refugees, the city of Linz is planted.
This would not be necessary at the moment, since the people concerned could be subjected without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, further locations should be checked for the emergency.
Criticism follows the city chief in the division of refugees within the Federal Republic of Germany.
Other regions must also contribute here.
Seafarer: "Limits will not be removed"
In a longer phone with the Bayr Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Landeshauptmann Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed on the next day on the refugee question.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders will not be lifted.
The travel of refugees to the Federal Republic will continue to be possible.
However, there is now even the appropriate border controls.
Special training with refugees to Germany will not be given first.
However, the applicants would be brought to Germany with regular training.
Leaders from other EU Member States have once again called for greater solidarity in refugee issues.
The fact that Austria is now reintroduced again at its borders is "a logical consequence" for the leaders of Germany.
The next roundastic is a question of time
The generalization of the "New Werft" in the left industry line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the priceed IT group S&T is included, the rest (2700 square meters) is to be reserved for young innovative companies from the technology field.
"In the IT the blind heads of our raw material - and we have to try to work for us," says S&T Chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in start-up companies of the New Werft, and later also acquire whatever.
From the beginning, S&T wants to co-operate with the new neighbors - of which Niederhauser promises himself: "The next roundastic is only a matter of time".
EUR 1.7 million was invested in the location by S&T, EUR 3.3 million by the Technical Centre, which belongs to one third of the city of Linz, the country of Oberösterreich and the Federation (FFG).
The building is packed by the Linz AG for 60 years at S&T and Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square metres of the rest of the building are already rented, 40 percent are requested.
Lia-Peroni holder opened second business in the Arkade
In the new shop, Furla handbags are in the middle.
In fact, Jutta Breit wanted to raise a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni had to put his hand up in the baptism market arcade: Finally, she has grown up in the form of another business place.
In the Furla shop against the business in which it sells, under other bags, bags, bags, shoes and yarns of various manufacturers, everything is now going to have 75 euros for the Women's Handbags of the Furla brand.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been operating since yesterday.
It was built several weeks ago.
"But I've been explaining for a long time whether I'm going to open another load," says Breit.
In particular, the fact that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also aware of the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who owns Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has made wide use of her mother in the streets.
Most of the time, I can see something developed and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why do so many women not respond to the latest safety when looking at a beautiful handbag?
Maybe it's because a nice bag appreciates every outfit.
The bridgemaker from Call City
Donald Trump's predecessors came from a place whose inhabitants are known as tenants.
This property is also linked to the billionaire who wants to be the US President.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for fans.
Whether he acts out of hostility, acts against journalists or exposes ignorance in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. presidency plays a strong role in the election struggle.
And cuts off well.
This is also recorded in the Pfálic city of Kalll, where the parents of the real estate billionaire are raised.
The New Yorker with the Fühnfresur is a term in the wine-traße wine village.
Some of the 1200 inhabitants are over -zig echoes connected with him.
His father came from Kalllstadt to Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in the election.
The Kalllstadter Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about their goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think those who find it kind of exciting, but they are not so impressed in their call cities," says Simone Wendel.
The bourgeois Kalllsädterin has filmed an amusing documentary about the place and its famous sprösslings, including the Kitchup family Heinz.
Trump, who is not known for information, also comes to the word "Kings of Kalllstadt" (2014) - with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kalllstadt.
He didn't bring it to the king of hearts.
Although it gives respect before the family's performance, it also tends to think that Trump "is already a little big man," says Wendel.
In any event, the name Spitz, which has the city around the circle, "The Brulljesmacher" - to the German: the provider, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the sellers.
The Trup's success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather departed and opened a place for gold miners in the United States.
The foundation stone of the real estate company was the first real estate sale in New York.
However, the life of the grandparents was not free of tragicity: your desire to return to the home for a long time broke apart in the state of Bavaria, which was then part of the Pfalz.
He did not take up Trump because he had just left without permission, the director of the Institute for Phalsical History and People's Science, Roland Paul, explained to the film start.
Trup is the single of a "illegal alien".
This is contrary to the marked statements of the follow-up.
He had repeatedly talked openly about Mexican immigrants in the United States and had called for the construction of a border wall to expel illegal immigrants.
"It's not as sympathetic as it is," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative trups ("The Oma was a born trup, the Opa was born Heinz").
The winner in peace sees the American more distant, "he's always so exciting."
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He's never been around Call City."
The pension-wirtin Veronika Schramm mentions how some call cities, that a family of Heinz paid for a visit to the church, which was generally well received.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
She would do better if he didn't win the election because "he has such radical views, I don't know if it's good".
If those who had said the words at the time of his grandfather in the United States were like him, "he'd never come there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzertochter Sarah Bühler.
And as President?
"My President is not here," she says.
And: "The widows will also be raised without the Presidents Trump."
Wendell's film, which was long interviewed for the trumpet, has seen 12,000 cinemagagers, and in the United States, the interest is growing.
The Upper Ramsau municipality at Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteiger village".
From the Vice-President at the German Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-e inhabitants' village in the National Park of Berchtesgaden received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 mountain goats.
In the neighbouring country, there is the Alpenverein responsible for the award of the award.
A mountain village may have a maximum of 2,500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the evaluations, despite Nine's attempt to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson moved to Canberra to report the loss of the Liberian leadership, but there have been no major changes in today's evaluations.
The morning show by Nine was excommunicated by the Bundeshaupt, when Malcolm Turnbull created Tony Abbott's storm.
The Rival Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armyage, was part of a weekly series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This part of the distance did not seem to play a role for Australian TV drivers, since Sunrise averaged 397.000 visitors to the five main cities, compared to Today 339,000.
Today, there was a slight increase in ratings for Monday (37,000) and last Tuesday (23,000), but his number remained behind the last Thursday (3433,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today reached an average of 318,000 compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has averaged 349.000 visitors to 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of the change concern these people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for checking!
Written by TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015
The great news for Seven was the impressive Debt of 800 words with the original series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently inspired father who decides to let himself and his two children down the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million visitors.
Critics wondered if Thomson could bring a hit show Solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday evening answered with a clear "Yes".
The X-factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million visitors and ran easily The Block (838.000) and TBL families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results at night two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new Quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, was averaged 446.000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 till 18:00) ran on 623.000 visitors - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot Seat (613.000).
The first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 550,000 visitors at the Montagband, and in the second half, 720,000 sat.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
The return to the quota of the second evening of The Chase Australia will probably agree that the hot-seat will finally be translated at 17:30.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for millions of dollars minutes that did not make it possible to skip McGuires Show.

The last three votes agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret enthralled? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Marcoski may have been undisputed who won The Bachelor.
The woman, who finally settled Sam Wood in The Bachelor, was held in the largest secret settlement.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not be rewarded if they are the one who received the last rose.
But when we were with Sarah Mackya, Snezana Marcoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows on the day before being checked out of three, you may have given some indication of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips fixed until the end of Thursday
All three women have left behind in a lyrical way why the perfect man is Wood and mentioned his sense of humor, dignity, family values and positive attitude as a reason why they want to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "If you don't, who should get the last rose of Woods?", their answers could be devastating to the player who won the Bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Marcoski called both fast - apart from themselves - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship since the first day.
"From the moment I went home and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam's energy, I said that they were very sympathetic, and I thought about it all over the course of the show," said Yeavons-Flelows.
"Sarah stands on the ground with both feet, it makes so much fun to be with her," added Marcoski.
I've seen them together, and they've got the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said the last week of the house visit made it clear that wood could be "one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, it became clear to me that this apparently is not just a game - I'm now unsatisfied about him," she said.
And when she was asked, who should choose wood if she wasn't there, she was furious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the rest of the remaining girls equally - it's a difference between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor is released on Wednesday, 19:30 p.m., at ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his conversion to the United States - and there were many other teams that sent applications after his impressive open day of training last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and trainer Jim Tomsula and it looks like a bad decision.
Some coaches had tied Hayne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost an order as well as the Austrian-Ruggby-Liga conversion at his first turning on Tuesday at 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to return to a point and also in the current game after a disaster by Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing cabin after the game.
Instead of washing his clothes before the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged her.
Tomsula also strengthened Hayne publicly at his press conference after the game.
The 49th Sport Reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who laughs at forgetting his shameful catch and caring for the next game.
Jarryd Hayne fits at a point that was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start, Hayne and his massive Australian success for his NFL Debt.
Hayne left the game field running after the Fumble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine any worse start in his NFL careers,
"That was a thing that happened now, you just care about the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the cutter to his original Debett in 2007, when a passport led to a trip to Queensland in his own in-goal area.
However, it was a great experience for the 27-year-olds.
Hayne positioned for a photo with fans and held an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss school rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a civil role field with a gunfight.
After calling out President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was sentenced, his oil company Yukos was arrested and his democratic efforts were put to the test.
The free voters require the establishment of 1000 new teachers in Bayern due to high refugee rates.
Party and Group Chief Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW-Herbst clause in Großwall City before a severe crisis at Bayerns Schools, when there are no new teachers for many new students: "We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to keep the schools in front of the collapsal," said Aiwinger.
"So that we will get skills in the Bavarian education system."
The country day group of the Free Choicers will be held in the sub-Francian municipality until Friday.
In fact, there were other main themes.
But the number of refugees now dominates the free electoral movement.
"Of course, the theme of Asyl will be overlay the clauses," Aiwinger said.
Aiwinger called for the establishment of UN refugee protection zones in Syria, as it had been during the Yugoslavian war in the 1990s.
"That's not the way it goes, we have to go to the reasons," said the free electoral head.
Dedicated asylum seekers want to reject the free voters as soon as possible.
For this reason, Aiwanger also requested more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW chief criticised that several Federal countries were not consistent: "We need federally uniform standards."
"Bayern's running away, not another one."
"That's why we have to become more competent."
However, the country's policy in Great Wall City should not fall below the table.
A long-term burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spain (CSU) launched the pilot test "medium plus" at 47 Gymnasies, which will test the extension of the gymnasium level from three to four years - the result will then take nine years to the studio.
But that doesn't go far enough.
"The G9 must be speeded up," said the FW chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all Gymnasians who want it.
Free drive at G9 wherever it is desired.

4 Killed After Police Shooting Gummings on demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot Gummishis in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution, said an officer in the middle of the week.
The violence took place at the service station in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, head of the district, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, some of whom had stolen stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police had used Trenenga and then shot him in the air before she got back to the rubber box.
20 police and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the used rubber shells, known as those that could kill, but which were traditionally used as less deadly alternatives, apparently produced such a high rate of death.
The conversion was the last week of violent protests in southern Nepal, where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi said that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Tharus, who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been subjected to violent arrests since the 10th century.
August was killed when the four large political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
The work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators agreed this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The main part of the Elder Youth Centre is to be rebuilt by Old Post.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of 4000 square meters.
Planned is a mix of trade, business and housing - concrete offers are not yet available.
Emden - The town of Emden wants to market an area of approximately 4000 square meters in direct proximity to the Youth Centre Old Post.
The preparations are currently under way.
It is planned to use the land for a mix of trade, business and housing.
You're waiting for the corresponding offer, it's from the city.
Which investor's asking questions is not clear yet.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had a part of the property situated on the street / Ecke Large Street, already bought a few months ago and left the building on it.
Project Hiev: Details are on the table
The holiday home planning at the Small Sea is organized at Emden.
The investor introduced public plans for the project for the first time.
Some of them are still concerned - they fear the sale of their freedom of choice.
Months after closed doors were negotiated, buried, debated and drawn.
Now there are plans for a new holiday home at the small sea near emdens on the table.
The stakeholders, the Mediterranean Elder Company "System-Build", presented his plans for the first time in the Elder Council's Urban Development Committee at the Montagabend.
This point was originally based on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critic and the FDP Group, who are in favour of the investor and administration of the secret realm, Ralf Behrends, from the system-building business led to the Offensive: "We have not yet answered all questions", he told the Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to deal with all the rumors now.
It has been in the debate for some 10 to twelve million euros.
Strong reactions among seafarers who came to the meeting called the pictures and new details to the hotel building they wanted.
Roberto Schulz, owner of the seabed and member of the board of directors at the interest of the complainant, Pro Hiev, complains: "This will be a risk lock that oversees all other buildings".
In addition, he fears, like many other project critics, that transport would take a heavy toll by the intended size of the facility: "All busloads must come in so that it can be calculated," said Schulz.
What happens right on the well a hectare large area of the former guesthouse, however, is still open.
There's no operator yet.
"First we have to have a closed concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this is still missing, the construction plans are still variable.
Two-year-olds at Gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo enjoys growing up at its Gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dean brought wishes to the world yesterday.
Bicycles are rare in Gorillas.
The last in a German zoo is almost 50 years back and has been in Frankfurt since 1967, it is called the Zoo.
The sex of newborn Gorilla volunteers is not yet established, since Mother Dian holds her in her body.
First, he reported the "image".
NHC says 60 percent chance for cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Center said a wide depth printing system is about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Islands, which has a 60-percent chance to develop into a tropical storm in the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined depth printing system, about in the middle of the Cape Verde Islands and the small hills, also has a 60-percent potential to form a tropical storm in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google starts double-spending campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a double-spent campaign to provide $11 million for humanitarian organizations, to help thousands of refugees who have been displaced by the European nations as they flee from war and imprisoned countries.
Google has an unusual personal approach to the announcement of the call on his blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google worker who escaped with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"There were many dark roads and buses on our journeys, including hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are looking for help.
The funds will be made available to four joint organisations, providing assistance for refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first global collection of funds up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugee life will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has killed more than 4 million people this year.
Many also fled from the war - torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mild overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether mildly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgery treatments.
"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote a leading article on the new study in JAMA surgery.
Weight loss operations or adipositas surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the magnet.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, adipositas operations have proved to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who are severely fat-free with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain degree of weight in relation to size, is normally between 18.5 and 24.9.
A 25 or more BMI shows that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered fatty.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compared these to two types of adipositas surgery - magenbypass and magenta training - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in humans who were easily overweighted.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year of this study.
In addition, the BMI remained in those who received non-surgery diabetes treatment at about 29.
Among those who suffered from a surgical infection, 36% of diabetes was completely resolved and 28% partially.
In the medical-treated group, the diabetes was completely resolved by only one percent and partly by just about two percent.
In addition, the results of control of blood pressure, triglyceride and "bad" LDL cholesterol were "in general better in the 'surgery' group", the authors found out.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of haemoglobin A1c, which reflected blood sugar levels over time.
Haemoglobin A1c will be kept at the best of 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the operation, the mean haemoglobin A1c level fell from around 9% to around 6%.
However, in the medical therapy group, it remained stable by about 8 percent.
But this better "glymetic control" - as you reflect in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce the mortality in five years, so did leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compares average results with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastrictomy group (18.7 vs 14.2 kg), greater BMI returns (7.4 vs 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs 2.1%) and previously recorded a complete resurgence of diabetes (46.9% vs 16.7%).
While the new study does not show the survival benefits of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of more serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to longer life, Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, there were fatty people who were subjected to an adipositas surgery, about 29 percent less likely to die during 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show any benefit in the survival of patients with surgery, Blackstone said it would be disappointing for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study, because she says that this operation is lower in this sub-BMI group", without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that as soon as they have collected these genetic changes that have bound their bodies with fattyness and diabetes, it is really hard to change."
Love Story Plays in Huntsrück
It is a topic that is now increasingly observed in Belletric: A young woman, at school, disliked and invisible, meets the blackness of her youth after years, and she loves herself.
So is the recent novel "We're actually not such" by Luisa Binder.
In addition to the love story, the Romans should be particularly interested in Hunsrücker readers, because he plays in Langweiler and the surrounding communities.
The main author is raised in Langweiler and is glad that she could make a literary monument to her homeowner.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not take all refugees, said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis was in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in the refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama discussed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of its ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in its speech on the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethical studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be placed in the given circumstances before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is remarkable, but the situation is not appropriate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria praised efforts to address the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"In order to care for thousands of refugees, it is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions, such as true peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we have to think about how the killing in their countries will be reduced.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama also discussed the problem of violence and commented on George Bush's acts after the terrorist attack of 11 September and pointed out that the violent reaction of the United States was following a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my opinion in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is inconceivable.
"I know his motives were good, but he resorted to violence, and that has led to unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the intake of hand infections by children in the last 4 years
In the United States, a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who have high alcoholic hand infection rates is reported by the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of seizures of hand infection in children under 12 years of age report by the poison control centres from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children are becoming more and more prone to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them go into emergency arrest," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectants, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a courageous test in social media.
Videos on YouTube show how to drink young disinfectants just because of a cheap experience.
Young people have reportedly mixed disinfectants with alcohol-containing water to get a stronger drink.
Young children may be affected by attractive swellings of the disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the attractive (hand disinfectants) are those who are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with soil, wine and orange juice that are very suitable for children.
Hand-infectives contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
In the case of young children, there are already few sprayers that can lead to alcohol consumption.
"It's the highest concentration of alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the GFD at the hospital of the University of Kansas, sending Fox 4 to Kansas City.
So, you wouldn't let Whisky out of luck, but people will let this hand-disinfecting device in the reach of children, and when children come to it, it's a quick opportunity to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl, who had recently taken four sprays from the ground-breaking hand infection in the school, was taken into emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179 times higher than the threshold that is legally applicable to adults, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, a non-occupational physician who treated her at the Winnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah laughed at her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency.
Doctors monitored them at night in a separate hospital on signs of brain trauma, since the girl had fallen by alcohol and had knocked her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very impressive," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijahs Mother, CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and store hand-in-hands outside the child’s richness.
In addition to alcohol consumption, some disinfectants were associated with fatalities.
In 2013, two women died in Ontario following the closure of hand-to-hand infections, which included a toxic, undeclared drug.
Health authorities suspect that the product contains a lethal solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which has been mentioned as an active substance.
In January, three students of the fourth class in New York State were planning to spend their "general" teaching on antibacterial products around the educational area," reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand-to-hand infections and has been forced out of her room.
The police considered the corrupt plan to be "study" and pointed out disciplinary measures to the school authorities.
Vulnerabilities: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old car driver was easily injured in an outbreak between the Querspane between Nordring and Herdens.
A 60-year-old truck driver went to the Querspane in the direction of cross-border transport industry and found that there were two previous vehicles in the rail transport.
As a result, he drove his car into the back of an audition and built this vehicle on a previous Ford Fiesta.
In the undisputed vehicles, damages of about 10,000 euros were caused by the police.
The 33-year-old audience was no longer ready and had to be removed.
Respiratory and thoracic disorders
Griffiths plays the generation of disharmony at Celtic Glasgov, Deila says that the Hopes are in a bad place, but that he will return it again.
Hearts will be fought by SFA because of Neilson's charge and Warburton will be careful of new obligations that could destroy the unity of the framework.
Don't raise control over Celtic on five points
ADAM Rooneys Elfmeter in the first half gave Aberdeen a quick victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so that the Dons can create a five-point luxury between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths play gear over disharmony down
There are complaints about disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was cited by Griffiths spontan. This meant that he and his men's cameras were not under increased control, as they were preparing themselves for the confrontation with the Dutch Table Leader.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are happy about it.
The lack of time-consuming competition in the Scottish football long-term Netherlands - de Boer
The former Rangers middlefield player and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic because there is no title rival with the Rangers.
De Boer, now a messenger for Ajax, said: "In Holland they don't show any heights of Celtic games anymore, and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about the old firm.
They're talking about both teams together and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension in the old firm games, and it's not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'll move things back, Deila says.
RONNY Deila has agreed that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian chief is hard to turn things around.
After the landing against Malmö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League, the landing followed the landing of 10 men from Aberdeen, who are now standing at the top of the table with five points of priority.
Deila said, "Celtic had already had bad times before, and we'll come back."
Now we want to get out as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel that right, but we have to go on.
We really need the support of Celtic, because it makes the players better.
Now it's so important to be together.
Warburton cautioned at January-Transfers
Despite his comments only a few weeks ago, which indicated that he had called for some January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is careful when signing updates and requires that he do not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox framework.
The former chief of Brentford said: "The January Transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season.
The men are really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with feedback
Swansea-Sturmer Michu, with Celtic during the transfer period in the conversation, has indicated that he could go back if his contract expires at the Swans.
The 29-year-old has been married with a light knife for two years and has not made the departure from Wales in this summer.
Hearts on SFA sword due to Neilson's comments
The hearts led 2:1, when Paterson was sent from the field, and then lost 3:2, but the red card of the defender was later raised - the third red card of Collum, which was rejected in eight months.
Neilson remains in what he said, and needs to say, "I have not asked integrity, I have not commented on performance."
Griffiths black to avoid Tynecastle
The infamous hippie was justified after he offered to have a song with offensive lyrics about ex-hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The event took place in a gate in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the stormer, adding: "It's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle if it's not playing for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board trusts Dundee-United Management
Simon Donnelly needs to know that Dundee United's board still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but it is necessary to finish down on the field.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're going to bring the boys back to sleep," Donnelly said.
McInnes was delighted to win against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes suggests that his men from Aberdeen had to fight doubt against Hamilton Aces in order to see a seven successive League victory that brought them a five-point precipitation to Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooneys Elfmeter in the first half.
McInnes said: "There is no man who has won everything, in poker games or leagues, the games of this kind have never won."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while growing in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged between May and July, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 per cent above the UK of 5.5 per cent, as shown by the figures of the National Statistics Office (ONS).
In the meantime, the employment in Scotland fell to 12,000 over the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell by 74.0 per cent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
State Secretary for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The Government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment.
Depressed breaks down the process
Since the security staff could not satisfy the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of Pfefferspray could the officials take the disturbances into effect.
An atomic alcohol test was found at a 16-year-old 0.89 promille.
The nurse was arrested by her mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 promilles and was at first in danger.
Why I'll be a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is brought to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a guest gallery in the death chamber in Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the wedding ring.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was already made for the first time in January on his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew closer, I began to fear.
So why should I do it?
I voted because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is agreed that journalists can see facilities in the United States, and since there are often more applications than places available, a nice lotteries will take place to decide who will be selected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five.
Who is selected to be observed without emotion.
I can't do that.
I'll sit next to Richard Glossip's best friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship during the month with telephones and a two-half hour visit.
I like the kernel.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a note and a poem to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of tweeting my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it, and you will get access.
I complained to her.
She thought she'd "be able to make it better," but she still thinks it's wrong what I do.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did it.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to write there.
If he dies, he thinks that the public work of the movement will help him against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter from Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I have made.
I don't want to go into all the details again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his attitude is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'll see him die.
I can't claim to be truly objective.
There will be other reporters to which you can refer.
What you get from me is what it means to see a man die without need.
After a cold police chase, a man is forced to come from the Canning River
The Canning Vale Policeman was upset when he rescued the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to quit the police was unsuccessful when he found himself in hot and cold water, only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "suck him quietly to return to the victim."
The police from Canning Vale were called on Tuesday to a housebreak event in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspects, they tried to get them out of Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I'm not coming out, come and get me,' said Senior Sergeant Stradl Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perahac was not too eager to make his uniform ours, so he turned to a more reliable tactic - "A good cop is negotiated".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try out," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Master's football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the grave to get out of an alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired natives to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins-Biathlon.
Peter Moody argues that Stewarts is trying to spy on him and dares to end the race
Peter Moody claims that Stewarts of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his premises last year and stopped to finish the race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewarts and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the late Scratching of Lady Tatai due to a run-in treatment, the last strike on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for the race sport and he had found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive Cobalt-Tupfer test at Lidaris which he could not explain.
He had been back 18 months because of the spying threats and didn't want it to be "exceeding as high-hanging dreams."
"I didn't mean to say anything about it, and I've been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," said Moody.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to change my priorities, and I want my owners to think that I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking, I don't do it, then I shouldn't be a trainer anymore.
Then I have to consider what I'm doing with my license.
Before, Moody had raised the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy out its steel.
"Fourteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were in a room with a man - whom I will call if I ask - and offer him a job in my place to provide information about what I'm doing inside my place," said Moody on Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a liar.
If that's the case, they should have taken their noses because they failed to arrest me when they tried to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RVL, David Moodie, former president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of it at the time and are still present.
Should that make me think it's gonna be personal?
Has the RVL behaved well and perhaps people outside of training are responsible for what is happening in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think I am.
Maybe they have to take my license and ignore me, and I have no doubt that what I say now allows them to think about it.
But now I've come to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I'll put pressure on them and force them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The trainer's Frustration Levels have been built with the long-standing Cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late Scratching led to his saying that he could "open his license over the table."
Moody, best known by his preparation of the unencumbered Master Black Caviar, called the race-day treatment rule "lightly", after a package of slamm or tone was placed on the horse legs, which was replaced by the rules.
"It's against the rules of race.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
"One of my employees has accidentally knocked on the leg.
It could have been like this last night.
It could have been like this all day yesterday.
But it was the same on the rent day.
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the package on the runday. An examination of this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who set up these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here's where you're going too far," said Moody.
Man arrested after driving
On the weekend, the police arrested a man after meeting with a driver and subsequent driver in Cobram.
The driver was introduced to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with a severe injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the car driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia of the police took part in Shepparton.
It is expected to be charged with driving speed and low aid and other traffic aspects.
The driver, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the hospital. He is in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy is fighting rivals because of claims to fight back
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy has called criticism at the tagling of his player as "agenda setting" by two Prime League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Rousters Trainer Trent Robinson said that the counsellors allowed the Storm players "fighting" with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday.
Brisbane Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a rather rare note to the Storm team after his men had achieved the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday. He called the game a "example" of the Rugby League and said that the two of Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended his men's charms and said that they were only focused on their "Contact" at the Tacling.
Bellamy added that the criticisms of two leading trainers to his men probably voted against him, as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"That's always getting up again - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about ring fights when they hit us 24:2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything to our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and this has brought us the trend.
Trent has been there for three years, and he obviously has to train a great man, so he's probably not used to lose it, so it was a little shock for him.
It is already funny how this is ever again seen in this year.
Bellamy seized Bennets' idea from the "spanning football" and reminded his mentor that Bennets St George Illawarra Dragons won the 2010 Premier League with "long-term" football in 2010.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting it was," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticised as a long-term team, and Wayne said he would take care of a mess.
But now he has a team that can play and we view it as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
That's the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn't think about us when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Rousters achieved a higher result than the game Broncos against Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two other trials in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are they pauses and don't do anything exciting?
It's the game plans for me.
If they mention us, it means that we will still meet them in a phase.
The Storm team is free this week because they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Chronulla Sharks on the next Saturday at the pre-final in AAMI Park. The ticket sale begins in the next Tuesday.
Serbia with $200,000 purchase by drug charge
A man who may have a life-long punishment is afraid of his attempt to come to the possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine, which have been smuggled to Queensland, was released against a charge of $200,000.
Marco Maximovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drugs on the Yacht Solay, which came from South America over Vanuatu and settled in Coomera in August.
Maximovic was watched as he met his mittags at the train station during the morning and later at the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Despite possible life-long punishment for trying to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, the lawyer of Maximovic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that he could have been in the cafe for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flalangan, was concerned about the flight risk at Maximovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he explained to the court on Wednesday.
At the trial, he accused the police of his stay.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather had offered a purchase of $200,000 as security together to achieve his release.
"After reading the valuable statements of the two persons, it is clear that the deposit of a security of $200,000 represents a real financial burden," said Richter Flalangan.
But that alone won't be enough to stop him, don't appear, he warned.
Maximovic was released against bail under conditions that he gave his Australian and Serbian passport, reported daily to the police and held at an exit stop of 18:00-06:00.
Inadvertent on A5 at Karlsruhe: Leader House meets each other
In a crash with three trucks on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe, a truck driver was seriously injured on the service side.
Two of the three cars involved had broken down before a permanent construction plant in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried to move to the left at the last moment, as the police told him.
The leadership house of the Infall Versailles has been completely different.
The driver was severely injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe North was completely closed over six hours to 2 hours.
There was a damage in the amount of 122,000 euros.
Stefan Hogg used the phone of girls to lock pedophiles to send images
A pädophiler used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stefan Hogg took the girl's phone when this ship entered an online messaging service from which he received a number of independent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping hogg.
She saw it through, found the disturbing reports, and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed the computers that were found under the address and discovered "relevant" Web research using the concepts for the search for independent images of children.
Hogg then claimed against the officials that he had done it because it would lead to "Pedophiles on the Internet" and then he "prepared to be a cop to scare them."
The state attorney Elidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "he said it would be a search - that he was eager to scare people.
He said that the search was carried out on his computer, but he said it was because he wanted to be a cop to scare pedophile.
He was asked after his conversations with the unknown person who sent the photos to him and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to lock her up.
He said he was sick in his head when he drank, and he said he wanted to see images of violence and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was on the guitar and on the wine.
She also saw the independent images on the phone and confronted the defendants.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and play station used to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty of having taken independent images of children on June 14th last year, to have lost this year against the charges and not before a hearing on March 24th of this year.
Defence attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg does not appear in the register of sexual offenders, as one might argue that "no significant sexual element" could be found in his memory.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael handed down the ruling until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but because of hearings, other still outstanding cases were held in investigation.
He was included before the date of the judgment in the list of sexual offenders.
Keys soft on small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being targeted outside the main points of control at the German-Austria border.
Many of the keys left out of fear before detection and arrest increase people in smaller border crossings
on the Austrian side, a speaker from the Federal Police said.
Over 1,000 refugees have been arrested during the border crossings of the country, Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They were on foot over bridges and stairs reached the German side.
There they were taken into custody by federal police and continued to be registered.
In Munich the main railway station, more refugees were visited by the Bundespolice data compared to the beginning of the week on Wednesday.
Up to 8:00 a.m., a speaker said in the morning about 700 people in the capital.
After the re-entry of controls at the German-Austria border, the city was reached on Tuesday 1759.
Stuttgart: expected issuer of Tropensturm "Herry" in the south-west
Meteorologists warn of storms in the southwest of Wednesday.
Because of a deep press area across Western Europe, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart was currently in a hot, winding air.
The strong depth is the runner of the Tropensturm "Herry", which has been taken in the past days by the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic.
Heavy storms and colds are expected mainly in the bathroom.
According to DWD, until Thursday morning is also to be calculated in the Black Forest, on the Swiss Alps and in the bottom line with 60 to 90 kms.
On Friday, then, the sun can be seen again.
The mass makes's: every two years the autobuilders show their news on the IAA.
2015 is mainly to be registered with compact vehicles that are now particularly well-selled.
Cars from the compact class are currently specifically asked: Around 28.1 percent of the new permits are issued according to the KBA only in August on this segment.
This is also reflected on the IAA (public day 17 to 27 September).
Between all the futuristic concepts and new superclass and luxury cars this year, in particular, many new compact models are presented.
One of the largest premiums for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will stand at the top of the dealers.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel Chief Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
He belongs to the core of the brand.
In order to sell the volume model well, the new Astra should also not become much more expensive.
Opel presents an entry under the largest VW Golf competition, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs €16,990.
The Astra has a new 1.4 litre engine with 74 kW/100 PS.
In addition, the horses offer additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 PS to 147 kW/200 PS, for which they first count three-zylinders petrol.
Unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, there is the Opel Astra first only as a five-year-old.
As the second variant will follow in the spring of the Kombi, which is also to be seen on the IAA.
And in addition to the Astra on the IAA, what will be added to the new package?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra-competitor Mégane into race.
At the fair, the Mégane is only to be seen as a fifth in a conventional and intense sportal GT version.
In trade, he comes first in the next year, then also as a Kombi.
Infiniti: The entire new segment is the Infiniti Q30.
The Nissan Abbleger wants to find its position with the new model in the highly growing segment.
The compact Infinite fits fully into the design line of the brand.
The base model will receive a petrol engine with a performance of at least 90 kW/122 PS.
However, there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 PS or 125 kW/170 PS.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, who celebrates its world prize in Frankfurt.
Offers are offered the model with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1,0 liter turbo engine and a performance of 82 kW/111 PS.
The maximum speed is based on manufacturer input at 170 Newtonmeters (Nm).
The sale start of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not quite new, but around it is the compact class model DS 4, which is to be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the original Citroën Abbleger were placed above all on the front: here the refrigerator was redrawn and equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the information system was modernized, the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and the first time Apples CarPlay was integrated.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants such as the updated Mercedes A class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are mentioned on the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters cells are humanized
The Federal Constitutional Court granted an ex-container of the Tegel Court of Justice, who had been placed in a small cell for months.
Because of the damage to their human dignity, prisoners have essentially claimed financial damage if they are admitted to small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
The judges concerned can even hope for money if they were confined to the few days in the few rooms (Ex.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
This resulted in an ex-consultation with its constitutional appeal in Karlsruhe: it was filed in a single cell between June and November 2009 at the Berlin Tegel Court of Justice; the toilet was not spaced.
After that, the man, who was again on his free foot, was placed in a larger cell, according to his lawyer's statement.
However, his arrest charges against the country of Berlin were dismissed because of the unwarranted conditions.
However, the Constitutional Court held the judgment of the Berlin Chamber and indicated the case for re-examination there.
You see the man's human dignity damaged.
The Court of Justice now decides on the extent of the damage
Even if for legal reasons only a few days had been sufficient for the damage, if a claim was made, it would be justified.
Otherwise, it would be "to fear a compromise of the protection of personal rights".
The Chamber Court must now clarify the amount of the damage to money.
In the past, the Constitutional Courts have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
In April, they spoke only to a prisoner of injury because he had been locked up in a cell.
Human dignity is also a result of the multiplicity of a cell without separate toilets in 2011.
Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court, which in November 2009, a prisoner in a parallel case had witnessed a humiliating execution.
The same complaint was filed every three months between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the case of Karlsruer.
Berlin's prisons were also in the last few weeks because of missing personnel.
As a result, arrests will be held again and again 23 hours, increasing aggressiveness, even to beatings, should have come because of the tense situation.
After the invention of the judicial press station, 21 stations in Tegel are not occupied due to lack of growth, 19 are to be removed in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We created it"
The migration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor has decided to accept them.
What's going on in Germany?
About 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to a forecast by the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to the statement by Visekenzler Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to accommodate a million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can create it, and we will create it."
What happens in Germany is the following overview.
According to various forecasts, between 350,000 (assessment of the Federal Foundation) and 400000 (assessment of the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - and the next five years.
This is almost doubled as much as it has been built before (250,000 apartments).
The lack of housing is dramatic, especially in the case of affordable rent objects: 60,000 to 80,000 social apartments fall out of the rent price chain annually, and refugees will also be hired for these particularly expensive apartments.
Federal Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the promotion from 518 million to one billion euros.
It is very small in the view of the Pestel Institute: 80,000 social housing must be created annually and the Union must invest in support of 6.4 billion each year.
Some scientists and Federal Minister of Agriculture also feel that there must be more tax benefits for investment in housing.
According to estimates from the Institute for Labour Market and Occupational Research, 55 per cent of refugees in Germany can be employed for a long time.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically after their qualification to assist them in their accession, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, it is crucial for the integration of refugees to find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for value assessment in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of migrants, says Migration Research Dietrich Thränhardt.
According to Dränhardt, in Germany, it has given a political turn: the ban on the recognition of work for refugees.
While an employment ban was previously imposed on asylum seekers for up to five years, it was reduced to three months in November 2014 as well as the residence obligation that asylum seekers are limited to a place of residence.
In society - even because of the lack of expertise - the majority have taken the view that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly.
A large door for access to the labour market is lacking in German knowledge.
To date, there is no adequate offer for general and vocational language courses.
Studies also show that workplaces are most often transmitted by personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore based on the view of Thränhardt of the Royal Way of Labour Integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children to Kitas, estimated to be 10 to 15 percent: "It is only one important thing for the parents to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschenbar, speakers for young people and families in the Berlin Senate.
In order to convince the family, however, of the benefits of China, the administration distributes manuals in different languages.
If the need for educators is to rise significantly by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the educational capacity - e.g. by allowing more schools.
In the countries, students are prepared for education without German knowledge in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by well-educated teachers and teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no lack of them, says Beate's staff from the Berlin School Administration.
The German student network estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, there are no German asylum seekers or sufferers in the studio - the only exception was until Berlin, Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his position.
Student refugees may be able to facilitate access to higher education.
Because refugees with a residence permit or residence permit will no longer receive services under the asylum competition law when they start a study.
The latter shall not, in principle, have no duties, as they do not fall within the circle of the persons responsible.
Patient refugees had to live in Germany for four years in order to be entitled to bafeg, from 1 January 2016 to cut these Spain to 15 months.
However, these funding opportunities must also be closed, and Stepfen Krach, Berlin State Secretary for Science, and the German Student Network.
The students should have a job immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The State should successfully replace Islam with the same rights as the churches have, and the existing State Church law should continue to develop a new state religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare bond that is professionally concerned about the newborns.
The rights also include obligations.
In this way, the representatives of Islam must be able and ready to cooperate with the State in many areas and to allow him certain control options.
This includes the readiness to oppose religious fundamentalism.
The president of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazeek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany.
Those who wanted to challenge such conflicts in Germany, "had right to leave here in Germany immediately," he said in the Bayerian Rundfunk.
He proposed that the basic law be translated into Arabic.
Integration will be much more in the future than it is today.
In order to change the majority society, the elimination of discrimination and racism will be more urgent.
Germany, however, has, as a result of European decisions, been an anti-discrimination system and a general equality law for a few decades.
However, it is very slow to learn how the NSU murder series has shown that the police and authorities have systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: what migrant organisations and interest groups of Germans have not known for a long time and what international agreements such as the German Anti-Terrorism Convention need to be realized in the coming years if the country remains at peace and uses its new citizens and citizens their opportunities - for the well-being of all.
In general, Germany has been able to provide medical care for the expected refugees, my doctor, Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as man-power and capacity are concerned, we'll create it," he said to the mirror of the day.
However, additional money must be flown into the system.
In order to avoid interference, Montgomery requires all users to issue health cards at the same time as registration.
The benefits obtained may be calculated later with the Germans.
And for a long time, it would be highly questionable to exchange so many people with the restricted service catalogue, which provides for the asylum competition law.
On the other hand, the doctors make the language barrier especially possible.
Previously, the Berlin health scientist, Thea Borde, has shown that migrants are worse off than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practice, dolmetchers should be taken into account.
Many refugees, however, would have been helped with more general medical attacks in emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic look.
In refugee children, there are a lot of untreated barriers, and young people are talking about HIV.
With some other diseases, German doctors came from their training, but clearly, Montgomery means.
"Parasitation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize." And as regards the lack of medical care, it is possible that refugees may even be looking for relief.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, some refugees were even doctors.
In order to be able to practice, however, they must demonstrate their qualifications and carry out tests as soon as possible.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psychologically ill, according to estimates from the Federal Psychiatric Psychiatric Hospital (BPtK): most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
They are particularly vulnerable to refugees, explains Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A recent published study of TU Munich shows that every five Syrian refugee children arrive traumatized in Germany.
Those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder are led, inter alia, by the so-called flashbacks with Atemnot, Swyndel, Hearts and Deadsets.
Further symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders, severe shock and emotional fatigue.
To prevent the symptoms from being chronic, an early treatment is necessary, explained Munz.
In the meantime, however, only four percent of mental patients receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers may apply for psychotherapy in society, the treatment usually lasts for several months.
In addition, most social workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether treatment is necessary or not.
This often leads to misassessment, Munz says.
Many invite to sleep
The Circus probst, with the new insinuation of "solidity", draws back to the traditions of circus art.
The aim is to draw every age group into the band of fascinating acrobatics, animal resources and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to enter the mange on the bridge to sleep.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and Junior Chef.
"Liety" - under this motto is the current manoeuvre.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
So the gift to the desire is in the blood.
"It's important that people get away from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours," says the 27-year-old Junior Chef.
"Manegencocktail with Worldstadt-Flair," said Director Reinhard Probst his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000 kilometers long tour can now experience this flair.
The circus program convinces talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov clown family takes the audience with white and charm in their band.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their work.
The hero of the drum film wants to take the Cuban duo locker.
They identify themselves with these words with ease and mobility.
Your humorous art on the mast is supposed to bring women's heroes up in the storm.
In addition to numerous lake salts, the acrobatics of the Circus probst are also fascinated by the touch of fingers and the touch.
Balance with the wheel on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Fascinating and swallowing snakes at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is trusted with the oldest form of acrobatics as few others and fascinated with their mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," stressed Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Provst.
Mistakes in the position of circuses are only too often the subject of various animal protection organisations.
Stephanie Probst also takes the view: "It's not good for our animals, it's not good for us either."
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each strike unit.
The "extraordinary artists", as they are called in love, will be read from the eyes as soon as possible.
We want to cooperate with the animals and have fun with them.
The animal doesn't feel good, it doesn't want to be in mangy.
So the highest bid is good for the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture from a ShetlandPonyhengst and a Zebrastuit, the family is proud.
The two animals have been gathered together for eight years in a cave and nothing has happened.
"But suddenly, our little jumbo was there," says Brigitte Provst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for manoeuvres, but it is the unique mask of the circus probst.
For every visitor, it should be something like that.
"One thing is sure," says Stephanie Probst, "whether five or 1,200 visitors, we always give our best and are with all our hearts".
From 17 to 20 September, the Circus Probst will be invited to submit its proposals at 17 and 20 hours a day.
On Sunday the program begins at 11 and 16 hours.
Thursday is a family day, the prices for the presentation are reduced by 17 hours.
In addition, the animal store is open every day from 10 to 18 hours.
Simbabwes Robert Mugabe holds false statements in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down at the beginning of the year from a podium.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media.
Parliament's opening was also prompted by allegations by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous threats of death and that they were warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's response with noises.
In the past month, they had abandoned him and interrupted him during his talk on the position of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians had received SMS messages on their phone, which they had warned them to interrupt Mr. Mugabe's response.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he told journalists after Mugabes speech.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity will end in Parliament, and as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "careful" about the threats to politicians.
Hewlett Packard will be built up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett Packard is expected to grow from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in restructuring and savings efforts in the company's services.
HP will later be divided into two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its faster growing business hardware and its service activities.
The expected job recovery results in a charge of over $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, said HP in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will allow a more competitive, sustainable cost-based structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP President and Chief Executive, who should lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger focused than HP is today, and we have a wide and verifiable portfolio of businesses supporting companies in transition to a new style of business," said Whitman.
As our own companies, we are better equipped than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers worldwide.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion annually and "will be focused on the provision of less efficient, integrated technology solutions for companies", says a company statement.
It is divided into a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical installations called the Palo Alto Garage "the birthplace of the Silicon Valley".
HP has passed a massive restructuring to address the withdrawal of traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The approach of HP, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies, is the latest in this area, which is based on the conviction that a focused company will deliver better performance.
FC Arsenal Captain Michael Arteta says teammates must stand behind the injured Jack Wilsher before the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger pointed out against Wilsher that it was first September and that if his rehabilitation runs according to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Willshere will certainly be missed at least the next four games for England, and in view of his history, his participation in the next summer at the European Championship is still uncertain.
The great shame of this current problem is that Wilsher had stopped the last season after a separate bone damage and then returned to his old sweat during the presage.
"This kind of injury does not threaten careers," said Wenger.
It's a bone that doesn't heal well.
This is not a bigger issue.
This was just an accident.
It was not associated with his bones or the injuries he had previously.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the danger of further injuries, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unacceptable pattern.
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different diseases of Wilsher since his debut six years ago.
He also played only 65 of Arsenals 157 League games in the last five games.
The broader image for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League Clubs since 2007/08 in six of eight games.
Wenger accepts the potential of a devil crisis, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will be continued during the last season.
"Sometimes, when you get back from an injury, you have a bad time, a time when you have to strengthen your body and win the battle force," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to overcome it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal begins his champions-League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Deathham Hotspur the following Wednesday, and Wenger enters a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey are not moving to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Montreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and the players who need to send a small break," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal is clear in favor of continuing through Group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is part of the playgrounds with the largest bidder effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also disabled after 41 games, after the "invisible" campaign was launched in the last season.
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was struck by an earthquake, which measured 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger is of the opinion that Arsenal has taken the lessons from the past season with the champions-League capitalisation against Monaco and remains hopeful to lead the union with his management to his first European triumph.
"This drive is immensible," said Wenger.
It hasn't fallen in Arsenal yet.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I've been in business long enough to be realistic.
We're honest, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the Comedy Show, which gives us valuable lessons about men's friendship
The lack of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in view of the need for men to open up, even more doubt now than ever before, how suicides among young men prove to be on a 15-year-old height.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain, and it remained three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a painful life) announced 2015 as the man's year, with the aim of asking for help from men.
Friendship is the heart in the fight to overcome this challenge.
A current study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressed symptoms found that if the sufferer had enough high percentage of friends with "sounding voice", his chances of being released were doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of healthy friends shares the risks of mental problems.
But of course you need to have friends first so that a friendship can work.
In the time of social media communication, focusing on style of substance, the immediate availability of response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital life has doubled the necessity, strong, life-sustaining and successful, even though in reality the isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call foreign values; money, image, social status, everything at internal value costs - our internal view of personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper impact on our spiritual health.
And as a video player and billionaire recently explained, money cannot really buy happiness.
The good thing with friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Not every character was defined by his work, but by his personality, which was smoothed by the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandlers is frequent in mood swings, moments during football in soft sessels and the search for Ross to Rachel - all of this comes from knowing that men can relate to it in any case, even if they often refrain, to fully explore their feelings.
As a member of the telephone service explained to me, "my listening role for people who feel depressed and self-defense has really shown me how the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often don't feel able to talk to friends.
The old term "I come right here" has a huge effect on how it feels that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk openly about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that makes me feel when I try to offer longer-term treatment mechanisms.
It presents very clearly the small moments of men's friendship.
So much of my objective external status over the phone may also help people in moments of doubt, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so if you visit this weekend Comedy Central FriendsFest with the fully redesigned kulsses for the day, why don't you take your friends to a drink in the Central Park.
Or even better if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give him a kiss and say hello.
You don't know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria struggles to help PSG slow down
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matudii and Edinson Cavani after his encounter with Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the League Championships on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass on to Malmö.
Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held a course as the Paris Saint German champions League Season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at the Prince Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Debuts as a PSG player, who led the French master on the way, but then they missed a number of opportunities before they finally grew up, when Cavani arrived in 61 minutes.
With Real Madrid and Schachjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish Master, as they not only seek to qualify for the K.O. rounds, but also improve on the way to the four finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But as they got the points, there was no class game by Laurent Blancs team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics. He was later replaced in the game against his home city team and the unit he started his illusory career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win home or out in the Champions League. Therefore, it is a good start to win 2:0 to cause our opponent problems and to look back slowly, even if there are certain things that we still need to perfect during the season," said Blanc.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, even though I fear we haven't reached one or two more doors."
Ibrahimovic returned after his defeat to one of three changes to the Paris team, which was able to hold a 2:2 divorce on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League, but he was expelled by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine flying storm was named as the man who can take PSG at the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month, and he pointed out why, when he entered Marco Verrattis Pass after the Malmö defense, before he passed through the long corner of the network with Johann Wiland.
However, if anyone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, the Celtic who fought in a playoff to reach this level, joined with nine national players on the field and was with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field was facing a difficult opponent.
But besides a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who was far from Kevin Trapps pfosten in the 34 minutes of the siege, they were little attacked.
Instead, the PSG itself sometimes appeared, with some failures and bad conclusions, not lastly by Ibrahimovic, who was arrested in the first half of the first half of the trials after Cavani had used it after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more of a message when he brought his players into play, and it was a pass by Ibrahimovic, who turned Di Maria into a board of directors, which was transferred by Willand in the 52th minute at the pphosten ...
The second tower fell shortly after the hour-mark thanks to Cavani. Thus, the Uruguayan scored his sixth season after Ibrahimovic had set up a left bottle of Maxwell.
This ended all the thought that Malmö could come back to the game, and only a wonderful escape from Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the outcome low before the replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was introduced to a tower at the end.
The trainer of Malmö, Age Hareide, later said that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last champions-League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which has not had the same level.
Qualification games don't work out."
Get out of front of Paris!
It was a great game of them!

Xavi: Pep Guardiola stopped 2008 Switching to FC Bayern
World and European Master Xavi has played since summer 2015 for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar
The FC Bayern was apparently a few years before the commitment of Spain's Superstar Xavi, who played for the FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight times Spanish master, three times poker winner, four times champions-League winner, two times club world master, two times European master, once world master - the title list of Xavi is impressive.
In the summer, the average 35 years after 24 years left the FC Barcelona and moved to al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
However, in an interview with the Marca Xavi now reports that he was already standing before the 2008 EM before the decision from Barcelona.
"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid then won everything, we won't do anything," he says.
And it was also registered by the FC Bayern.
Xavi, "There was a offer from Bayern."
"Romeminege wanted me."
To remember: Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern in summer 2008.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change
But the change did not stop.
And the exhilarating man today works for the German record teacher: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça has taken Guardiola under contract and I have played a great EM."
"Pep told me I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the man without me."
"So he beat me."
Who knows how Bayerns would run the 2008/2009 game with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the fourth final of the Champions League against the Bayerns over the entire distance on the race, turned the roses off (4:0, 1:1) and celebrated the king's triumph at the end.
Matt Damon plays many times in the movies.
Matt Damon faced the African filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she won't be needed behind the scenes.
During a follow-up of Sunday Night by HBOs Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown stressed the need for alternative perspectives, although in relation to a black protagonist in the selected drawing book of the project.
"If we talk about diversity, then do it when filming and not when playing the show," said Damon.
Brown reacted shockfully, with mistrust and called "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the comments of the actor of The Martian were confirmed.
Damon and Brown, the producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers agreed to discuss the show finalists.
"I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - how they treat the figure of the harmony," Brown said first.
The only black person, and she is a benefit that will be met by her white tenant.
The producer of Dear White People introduced Leo Angelos and Kristen Branccio to the royal rights in the film; Damon said that their reign "may give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was postponed, the social media exploded before misinformation about Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr. Pooni put his tongue out over the clip by writing "Matt Damon speaks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain her diversity - that's SO WEISS that we're doing."
The Tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 Likes since its publication.
Damon's comments come at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the top of the social debate.
After young Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the movement of Black Lives Matter was aimed at spreading country-wide effects and pressure on lawmakers and authorities, discriminatory practices against colour content.
In February, the singer Prince played a role in the movement during the introduction of the famous albums of the year at Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
In recent times, leaders of the Black Live Matter movement have published a statement and, however, as a response to the issue of Fox News Privacy Elizabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be seen as a Hass group.
"The Black Live Matter Network is a love group," said the leaders.
Recently it was announced that Damon was on a list of stakeholders, producers and media modules invited to visit the pope to discuss the appearance of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or already met the pope, it is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' won the first champion
Professional sports clothing and service assistant Isaac Caldiero was the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the big price of $1 million with home.
The competition show, which just ended its 7th season, had never experienced a competition participant who could finish all the stages of its barrier course.
During the season, there were two men, Caldiero and Kameramann Geoff Britten, until the end.
The last task was to hold the string on a 75 foot long string in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time when he was the first athlete who completed the most intense phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero completed this challenge completely three seconds earlier, which made him a winner.
Caldiero spoke with E!News after the hard fight, still under shock over the profit of the great price of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had to live," said Isaac E! about his money.
As suddenly as I can't imagine, it's... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed joined The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britons, although he was the first to finish the race, did not receive any price.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
"If there's more than one finalist, it'll get that with the fastest time," said Weed.
As the money is a wonderful price and the life changes, it receives great gratitude.
I don't think he's wearing any grolls on it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received a lot of awards from fans.
He's such a great hero and a family father.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be killed by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had changed the roles.
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an eighth stage, which will begin work in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers like Minnesota Twins
The second half of the season was not particularly funny for Detroit Tigers.
Previously they were one of the best teams in Baseball, today the tigers are at the last place in the American League Central.
The tigers are reduced to their role as a sponsor, but this part played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday with 5-4 in the target field.
The Twins used a chance to rise within a half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard Square.
For Detroit, although only for one evening, it was a return of the three letters F-word, which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season.
"Every victory makes fun, no matter how it comes," said Tiger's manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support as Detroit three times in the first two indents, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) ran 6 times in the 1/3 interns and allowed three rounds.
It was his third successful start in his last nine parties.
"I want to end this year strongly," said Simon.
It's hard to shoot every game in the balls, and that's why I want to go into the game completely focused.
The designer Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two rounds, his first RBI since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-th game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6th.
"He's moved the wood well," said Ausmus.
He looked well out of the game (schlagtraining), looked much better out of the bubbles, and he brought it directly into the game.
With three rounds at the end of the seventh internship, the Twins had their best chance to get back into play.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton ended the inning with a double on the left side of the field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a point, and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before he was replaced by Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived the wall, the only man he was faced with, before the designed Rockie-Schlagmann Miguel Sano, who entered a two-run front.
With a couple of runners and the final run at the second stage, the third baseman Trevor plouffe brought to a Double Play.
It was the 27th time in Major League this season that plouffe hit a Double Play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, the wall created a RBI double against the closure of the tigers Bruce Rondon and reached the position of 5-4.
The right side, however, stood out of Sano at three pitches for his fifth Save.
Detroit benefited from the recording of the game from a yet unmoveable Phil Hughes.
The tigers achieved three rounds in the first two innings against the right-wing Veteran, which had been beaten before the game by the victim list after he had been missing for more than a month because of a return leader.
"It's obviously not the beginning I wanted," said Hughes, "but I felt better when I was relieved and said that I would make some pretty good jokes there in the third inning."
After they got the leadoff battery first, Hushes gave up a single on Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out Walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who created a single "up the middle" at the first round of the game.
Victor Martinez created his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right side, created another race, but Victor Martinez was expelled from the game when he tried to reach the third, which led to the threat.
The tigers added in the second, achieved one-out Double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center field Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"That was a great blow," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit him very well, but he's got the right place.
Hughes was in a pitch-count, didn't reach any points in the third inning before he was replaced by the left-hand hand A.J. later.
In Hughes there were three rounds at six hits and a wolf with four strikeouts.
WARNING: Tiger's RHP Anibal Sanchez was shot because of an injury to the walnuts.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the debt of Sanchez in 2007.

Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The leader of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, holds military measures with German participation in Syria for an opportunity.
"I believe that the different thoughts about military action options cannot take place without Germany," he said.
He suggested that the European states "collectively take sides".
Four years ago, it was a pleasure to see the neck of a military involvement in Germany.
"Now the conflict is raging in front of our house," he said in Germany.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive rise in international aid for refugees.
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
According to Germany, Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner explained that no one will be sent back to Hungary to the Austrian TV service provider ORF.
Germany has also not sent refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's so agreed," she explained.
On the question of an agreement that, after Germany, may take a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been discussions between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany on this matter.
It did not mention specific numbers and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In the past days, tens of thousands of refugees had arrived on the so-called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria.
Your goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU Heads of State and Government, requested a special fee for the following week.
Germany had started with cross-border controls on Sunday.
The EU countries have not been able to adapt to a common approach in the crisis.
The EU Interior Ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of more than 120,000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday (September 22nd).
In view of the strong flow of refugees in Germany, the Federation wants to strengthen its support for the recovery and distribution of people.
This will be managed by the Union with the countries, which will be announced on the basis of almost four thousand consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor in Berlin.
Marks subtly, those people who need protection also restrain them.
However, those who do not have a marriage perspective cannot remain in Germany.
This opinion has been explicitly shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a "earlier force effort."
Thousands of doubted refugees are trapped between the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia by night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that the border on Romania would be set off with a tsunami.
This neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU.
Hungary wants to prevent the strikers from looking for outlet routes across Romania, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said to the planned new border.
The Romanian Government condemned the plan immediately.
There were the first arrests of people who had broken the line.
In Turkey, therefore, thousands of other migrants followed eye reports on their way to the Greek border.
Space probe "Cassini" finds Ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the Spanish of Saturnmond's Enceladus, a global ocean is changing.
The conclusion of researchers from observation of the "Cassini" space probe.
This time the moon lights on its path around the ring planets.
This movement is only small, but still too large for a continuous fixed heavenly body, it is in a communication from the Cornell University in Ithaca (US State New York) on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the paper "Icarus".
It has been known for a long time that it must be given under the icedeck of Encelatus liquid water.
"Cassini" has already discovered ice kennel in the South Pole of Saturnmond in 2006 to smell the water steam and ice pellets and to feed the so-called e-ring of the Saturn.
At least in the south pole there must be a underground sea, closing the astronomers at that time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to spend about a month on Offensivator Valdette Rama.
An investigation has resulted in an adjudictor injury at the age of 27, the association shared.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Münchner Løen, the diagnosis means "probably four weeks of forced rest".
"That's hard for us, Rama is a very great loss."
"Of course we need to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "Image" series with a view to the possible obligation of an unifying professional.
However, as a training guest, the six were initially represented by a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at VfL Wolfsburg.

In contrast to the first fears, however, he remained without a heavy blow.
No diet - Mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and sweet.
But whoever wants to pay attention to his dirty line, it will be more often rejected by them.
Because Mangos contain relatively much sugar - mainly sucrose.
Health are the exotic fruit yet: B-vitamin and vitamins E and C. In them, however, Mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its premixture beta-carotine.
Therefore, those who eat the fruit support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, Mangos should not be too soft or tight and taste good.
The color of the scale itself doesn't tell you how rich the fruit is - so green mangos can taste very sweet too.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then they taste pure or sweet foods.
A mango, however, also has a special note of outstanding courts.
It softens the light biter taste of some leaves salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, birds, lamb and wild.
The U.S. Packaging Service UPS reimburses up to 95000 allowances for Christmas business in the United States.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, sharing UPS on Tuesday.
In particular, drivers are sought.

First spring, then marked Kaltfront
The next night, he entered the halls of the Alpenord page of the village, as Meteoswiiz announced on Tuesday.
In the middle of the night and in the night of the Thursday, the führer partially shines with strength through the führer.
After springing on Thursday morning, we are surrounded by a marked cold front, which brings powerful rainfalls, wind waves, and a temperature reduction.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of a vast deep press area over the British islands in a strong Southwest stream.
On the Alpennord side, night is the middle of the evening by the speaker.
As a result, the Führer to Donnermårmörm in the Führer between 60 and 100 km/h, and in particular in the Urnerland, also covers more than 100 km/h.
The foot can move up to the bordering Mediterranean, and even on the mountains, it is possible to reach an Orcan Bay of over 120 km/h.
While in the north on the midweek of sturmic foot for summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees, moisture begins to rise at the alpensüdhang.
Here's the rain that falls to Thursday.
In sum, the Alps have to be calculated in the next 48 hours, partly over 100 litres per square metre, which have already fallen in the last days.
On Thursday morning, the Fünn leaves the air, resulting in a cold front with a strong, partly heavy flow from the west to the east over Switzerland.
Together with the Kaltfront, the wind cools up strongly to the storm, and the temperatures go back significantly.
The following days will be presented in the north with 15 to 20 degrees, in the south it will be more sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of President Ignazio Marino, an unnamed place in the park was recently baptized in the name of the German Reformer on the Oppio Hill.
At the Piazza Martin Lutero, he is now known as the German Theology of Reform.
The park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Colosseum.
The nomination was applied by the working community of the Evangelical Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran community in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the Popes over the centuries were often able to live as a minority only in those who had their faith hidden.
It will be seen in symbolic ways that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) stayed as a young Augustine monk about the 1510/11 season in Rome for a few months.
He then received the city as a coming sin benefactor.
His negative impressions should have strengthened him in the eyes of historians in his later struggle against Rome.
Luther had then introduced the sect of the Western Church with his thesis against the slave trade.
Hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus is one of the main works of Otmar Alt for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
Was it the word at first?
No, not in the Otmar Alt Bible, which has now appeared with beautiful pictures.
At first, the picture for Otmar Alt, which formulated his entire personal interpretation of Bible stories on paper and canvas in 150 motivs.
His "language" with beautiful colors and fantastic shapes has received the 75-year-olds - but what is not equally significant is with "pleasant" images.
On the contrary: Adjusting the respective topics can make it very hard.
For about three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has encountered a subjective artistic selection from the many subjects of the "books of all books".
Distortion is cycles that focus on topics such as crosswalks, beaches, bids or watercourses.
To this end, he has fascinated several partners equally: this applies to the Luther version with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler version with its focus on the works of art.
And there is, above all, the author Klaus Altepost, who has established himself on the basis of the painting with the respective Bible texts.
He interpreted the Bible texts chosen by Otmar Alt and thus into today, in current contexts "translated".
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alts painting.
They are interwoven between Martin Luther's original Bible library and a set of artists, who form his very personal thoughts about the situation.
The jewelry band has gold letters.
So the 75-year-old also doubles a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Finally, emotions were at the very root of the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerede in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant lords' orders.
"The training was already done with the Rohrstock," recalls Otmar Alt.
"I tried to work it out so that maybe I could get back together with the Lord Father."
Its second cause is to help the art of fast-lived time to increase its value: "The perception of images is today inspired by advertising, and it is loud.
It's going to get blown up.
Artists have another fun and good to show things.
Images have always something secretive and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall away" into the pictures, let them see, discover and see what power they have: "The image is looking for against."
Klaus Altepost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar Alt Bible in the Otmar Alt Foundation, "has always been" a lover of Otmar Alts art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures."
Not only has the Bible been fully understood but it has also chosen secret subjects that are important to him.
"This was no cooperation on eye height," says Altepost: "It's about the images that the text just explains." It was a picture Bible.
For Hans Möhler from the Luther edition, this work is an invitation to "to deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alts speaks pictures for Möhler both the (Bible) language of love and the responsibility.
A part of the original - paper and canvas images - is first presented in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Build Start for BMX Path
Plans made, found place, commissioned companies, modeled rents for a round course: A year later, almost everything was finished - but even before the official opening of the BMX train was finally closed.
Consumptions in politics and administration resulted in disturbances, especially in the people who did not want to wait on the train.
So unscathed, looking for a new place - now with formal planning and application for construction permission.
The permit will be entered in October, the first community director Sabine Mosbach-Book could now be notified to the Committee on Children and Youth.
"I hope this year is still visible," she said.
Then it should begin without "more meditation" with the work at the former hall bathroom.
DFB intensifies the commitment for refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundeslaga sets a significant sign on the weekend.
The football responds to the expected situation in Germany and the policy ensures its assistance in addressing the challenges ahead.
"I have held this for the biggest challenge of our country since reunification."
"No one can say that in principle, it doesn't matter to me, I have nothing to do with it."
"This must be of interest to each individual to get this subject in the grip," said DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wishes to address the refugee situation in Germany.
"I'm next Wednesday at the Chancellor and meet the State Minister Mrs Özojöz and the Chancellor."
"That will certainly play a central role," he announced.
The football can and will help.
But the decisive softties must be the policy.
The German football band has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" for four years.
"On the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019," Niersbach said at the end of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some federalists also support this program.
Already this week, the 36 profivores set a significant sign when they are placed on the left triangle instead of the other regular sponsoring logo (hermes) the expression "We help - #refugeeswelme".
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help, where and how only they can," said Leverkussens Sporthef Rudi Völler of the "Image" series (Dinsday) and described the project as "self-conscious".
"The refugee drama is about everyone, no one can see."
"We can football federalists, no, we need to use our power, influence and our opportunities to help many refugees who have already become so unbelievable," said Hertha-manager Michael Preetz.
Peter Righttig spoke of a "prominent sign of the League".
For the EM Qualifications game against Hungary this Friday, the National Mission of Women invites 100 refugees to Hall/Saale.
Niersbach called the support of refugees as "a great community work of German football".
That all 36 license companies had started their own projects in their places is great.
It's so great that small and smallest units are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome", which we have issued, will live in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this year and the next year, the association with the DFB election and the Federal Government will provide EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees.
"The Union has already called out all the sums for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP Chief lost an eye when an accident occurred
The head of Europe's largest software company, Bill McDermott, has subsequently lost the left eye through a storm in early July.
When the accident occurred at the stairs of his brother's house in the United States, after midnight he fell onto a glass of water that he had carried in his left hand, he reported the " business week" on Wednesday.
"He's almost bloated, he was powerless, then he got out on the street - that's what he told us last week," quotes SAP-based Hasso Plattner.
McDermott, however, could follow his work.
"In the beginning of October we will meet before the Watch Tower meeting in Walldorf," Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager will be at the meeting and "full-time".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "South German newspaper" (donnersage issue), he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software companies.
"I'm full of SAP there, full of my job."
"Of course I stood in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its President Hasso Plattner," McDermott of the "SZ".
McDermott is usually between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he has been no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It would be important for him to go to the public with such personal history, the manager of the "SZ" said, "Everyone can go through something like that."
"It's important to get up again if you fall asleep."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen other than fat ...
Magnussen tweeted an appropriate photo and explained that he had suffered the damage when he was beaten by the wheel.

Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfaller in the Tower
At Borusia Dortmund, all hopes of a comeback by Marco Reus have finally been raised in the first group game of the European League.
The national player will also miss the football club leader in duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 p.m./Sky).
"We can't get back on him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be there again on Sunday at the Bundesliga summit against liver Cuss, the BVB-Coch opened: "We expect him to return to training on Friday".
In view of the high burden of his profession, Tuchel will not only change his stem in the reus position.
So he announced a change in the Torhüter position.
This is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of the tribekeeper Roman Burki.
"He's training at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world teacher.
Whether Weidenfaller will come into use in all the European League games in the future, however, Tuchel was open.
With high probability, he will also oppose the second party.
The research statement by Player Reus that the final introduction to the BVB in Europe League should be the goal, middle-level player Julian Weigl thinks it's not so wrong: "So Marco is not so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance to take off the title."
Robots: Government wants to take the lead in Germany
Germany is to be a technological leader, according to the will of the Federal Government, at the turn of the car.
The Federal Bureau decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of Minister of Transport Alexander Dobindt (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the side of the IAA Automese of a "new mobility-timer".
The automated and networked vehicles will increase traffic safety and provide less noise, said Dobindt.
He also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from G7 countries, who also come together with representatives of the industry on the IAA.
The Ministry of Transport's strategy paper highlights, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband development and a slow transition to digital sound.
In order to test new technology, a test line is currently on the highway 9 in Bayern.
In order to ensure that the driver "no additional liability risks are raised", the Federal Government intends to "check the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
Germany would therefore like to apply some internationally to increase the permissible maximum speed for self-propelled cars from 10 to 130 km/h.
In addition, the Federal Government wants to apply itself to a change to the Vienna Convention, which has been intended only for people as drivers.
In the case of automated driving, the driver will increasingly take over the driver's driving.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data quickly.
After a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, high-automated cars will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, unmanned vehicles on public roads are "expected for the first time after 2020".
The creation of value in the field of train service systems and high-automated driving functions in Germany estimated the authors of the study for 2025 to around €8.4 billion.
"The digital connection of the Pkws can lead to greater security and efficiency in road transport," said Søren Bartol, Søren.
However, the issue of liability for accidents and the safety of the driver's personal data must be clarified clearly.
However, the German cars themselves still look skeptical - much more than French or American.
A survey submitted by the Forsa Institute on Wednesday in the order of the Dekra test organisation shows that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous cars will be translated in the next ten years, 32 percent will only be counted in 20 years, so 31 percent will not believe in it at all.
In France 21 percent of the respondents up to 2025 are auto-run cars, 33 percent in the United States.
In addition, car drivers in Germany are not yet ready to leave entirely on a self-propelled vehicle.
After a collection of the Bitkom digital bond, only seven percent would agree to give control over all roads during the entire journey.
On the highway it could be represented by 15 per cent in the floating traffic, 45 per cent in the station.
Every quarter of the car would not have left control under any circumstances.
Boll says team and double start at table EM
The Düsseldorfer wants to be alone in the battle of title from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision shall expire on 22 September at the latest.
"This is a loss of rice for our team."
"The boys learned it in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM education course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was at this point on the flight to a long-term agreed sponsoring term in China.
The 34-year-old German master is expected to return on Friday.
"Without Timo, we are no longer such a clear favorite," said Single European Prime Minister Dimitry Ovccharov.
The Hamelner, who conducted the list in Jekaterinburg, also recalled the 2013 EM in Schwechat.
"Timo also failed at the time, and we became European masters."
"We should focus on this," said the World Ranking List Five.
The English football national player Luke Shaw from Manchester United has committed a serious injury to the right leg.
During the champions-League game at the PSV Endhoven, the champion was hit by Héctor Moreno and exchanged after long treatment.
The first diagnosis showed that at the age of 20, former players from Bastian Sweiinsteger pointed to a spinal cord.
Gautier feels too old for a child terrible
It is a mixture of a very large modern view and a growth-fixed grid: Designer Jean Paul Gautier (63) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The heights: mirror pumps, thanks to video projections, look amazingly human.
They bring the spectacular creations of the French designer, which, among other things, became the big star of the fashion scene with Madonnas Bühneoff - and so that he caught men in Röcke.
"I can't say today that I'm the baby terrible of the skin Couture, because I know her."
"In the past it was left, in the middle it's true," said Gautier.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the city stage on the track), which is to be seen from 18 September at the exhibition hall of the Hippo Culture Foundation, it is a joy that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude to a look at his person.
In fact, he was against it because, "I hear an exhibition a little after death," he said.
If you die, you come to the Museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the hardly too much of the work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed a training.
Chronologically, the view has not been built, but it is an excellent choreographed overall art work for which a great deal of effort has been made: to refresh the lungs, for example, a stylist itself has been engaged.
14 tons of material were drawn by the makers after the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot's statements.
Shortly before the start of the October festival, there was another special weakness: a leatherhouse outfit with corset.
Heidi's daughter, Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are weaker than men") and for people who are a little different, said Gautier.
Also Gaultier's old Teddy is to be seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the first, highly developed fashionable design.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in the football) he took his Teddy BHs and clothes, said Gautier.
To play with a doll, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
The design of fashion later he joined himself.
He made fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gautier told in Munich.
Then I bought it, of course.
For his first fashion show, he could not pay the models.
They didn't get anything, but they were afraid to keep the cramots.
Beauty instead of Garden - Player Spitze as fashion-Nies
Earlier it went to the long stick machines and to make planes.
The existing materials and chips were created in large quantities for customers, for example, to continue processing roofs and gardens.
This alone doesn't work today anymore, explains Andreas Reinhardt, director of fashionspice plauen.
Instead, the fashion is again important.
In the early days of the piano peaks, fashion played a larger role, then was shaken by the domestic textile industry - and is now re-covered as nothing.
Reinhardt cites some examples: jewelry in jewelry, with accessories such as bags and regional shoes.
Above all, the so-called Vintage mode, which is based on past styles, represents an increasing potential for command.
Anyone who does not pay anything in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
They are already making up half of all the orders for us.
Modespitze Plauen together with nine other companies is a member of the Plauener Group of Spices and Stickeries.
Only they can carry the protected label.
In the last 15 years, around 80 percent of the turnover has been broken down.
Private business and wholesale trade are almost gone.
Our products will not reach customers this way yet.
The massware will be produced much cheaper in the Asian area today and is almost exclusively sold over chains.
In addition, export weaknesses, currently in Russia and the USA.
So there are good reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to point out environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer of the Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year, we have been conducting a quality set that shows that we produce organically and socially legally".
Reinhardt adds: "This also concerns the materials used."
Diplom designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger University of West Sächsächsische Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Art - and specializes in paintings and ceilings.
To counter competition from the Asian area, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
It creates a tension field between the latest ideas of designers and companies that need to think economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore an existing design will often be easily varied to keep a customer status.
A few years ago, Textile Designer Kati Reuter relived the historic snowball peaks.
The machine is attached to some places to small boilers.
Plauener Goldsmith Master Bianca Hallebach-Kruße was inspired by this: "I couldn't start anything with traditional platzes."
Now she uses the snowball chips for her beauty.
In an ongoing process, she wears the pattern in Silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of Player Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It is also provided in the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers who have lived in and around the world and who want a piece of memory.
So I see my beauty as a modern messenger of the Plauner Spitze.
Disney plant a new Mary Poppins movie
Liars shouldn't be touched, but Disney is still waiting for a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
However, according to "Intertainment Weekly" it is not about a refilm, but about a kind of continuation that plays 20 years after the first film with the magic girl.
It is about the experience of the Nanny with the Banks family in times of the world economic crisis in England.
Whoever plays Poppins for more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already determined: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi insists to open the economy wider for the world
The economy needs to open up more and more to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on the Tuesday of a group tasked with the launch of the reform.
"China should use it to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business-based strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group for the extension of a comprehensive reform.
To promote innovation and promote reforms will create new momentum and vitality and provide a new place for economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of market access arrangements, the relaxation of border control policies, the promotion of state enterprises (SOE), private capital, and the overhaul of the resident market system.
According to the State, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and companies that are not involved in investment.
The system will be tested and tested and improved by testing programmes.
The initiative is important because it entrusts the market with a greater role in the allocation of resources, guarantees a legal business field and draws the market closer, the state said.
The government will also take control of the powers conferred on undertakings and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business.
The State also said that China would allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In the framework of a offer to open government-controlled sectors, further areas for private investment will be opened.
"The Government will not change its policy against foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," the state said.
In addition, it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the Green Card by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to guarantee their activities and to apply professional judges and public prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders, such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
The EU wants to double the mercury limit value in raw fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large raw fish and thus to increase a significantly higher dose of renal insufficiency.
The Foodwatch consumer organisation, which presents a relevant EU work paper, criticised the plans: "The risks and side effects of the industrial and environmental policies that are under way will continue to be fully addressed to pregnant people and young children," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Footwatch.
Wolfschmidt is therefore expected to increase the limits of the renal inhalation for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as hai or black fish from "economic policy reasons" from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large raw fish have already been so heavily loaded with mercury that they cannot be sold on the basis of the existing limits of about 50 percent of the prisons.
After doubleing the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be sold.
In contrast to this closure, the EU, according to Footwatch, wants to increase the limit values for other fish from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch described this as "trick", because smaller fish, such as karpfen, are so low that they already contain the planned maximum values today.
The decline in small fish would therefore be "a perfect landing manoeuvre, which only helps the economy," Wolfschmidt explained.
Quecksilber is a high-quality heavy metal for humans, which is strongly suited to the food chain primarily in raw fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "a small amount may already be caused, especially in the case of unborn damage to the nervous system".
However, the Federal Ministry of the Environment states on its website with regard to the current highest values that a "health risk to the general population" is not expected.
Quecksilber is achieved primarily by coal combustion in the environment.
The German coal power plants, according to a written opinion of the Federal Ministry of the Environment, were more than six tons of mercury per year, two thirds of the total emissions in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish about Elbe, Rhean and Donau were "sustainable and flattened", the "spigel" quoted from the paper in March.
In the past year, European alerts to mercury in fish have already been identified as the most frequently reported health risks in the EU alert system RASFF.
