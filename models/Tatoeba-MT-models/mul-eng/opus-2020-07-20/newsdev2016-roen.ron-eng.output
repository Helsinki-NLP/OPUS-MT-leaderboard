The head of the Brazilian Presidential Cabinet is brought before the court
In March, a federal judge accepted the charges brought against the former head of the Brazilian Presidential Cabinet for alleged involvement of him in a massive scheme of corruption against Petrobras state oil company.
The federal prosecutor's office said Jose Dirceu would be sent to trial for the allegations of corruption, fraud and money laundering this month.
Other fourteen people will be judged, including Joao Vaccari Neto, former treasurer of the People's Party, held in power in Brazil, and Renato de Souza Duque, former president of Petrobras companies.
The Director is the oldest member of the People's Party to be found in government custody for relations with this scheme.
The director served as head of the former president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva between 2003 and 2005.
He was arrested at the beginning of August at home, where he is already under house arrest, with an 11-year sentence for involvement in a voting scheme in Congress over 10 years ago.
The prosecutors stated that the Dirceu had developed the Petrobras bribe scheme, accepted the bribe while it was in operation and continued to receive payments from entrepreneurs after it was closed at the end of 2013 for the polling.
According to the prosecutors, the Petrobras scheme involved about $2 billion in the form of myth and other illegal funds.
Some of these money would be returned to the campaign fund of the party to the government and its allies.
It would also have been introduced to Petrobras in exchange for contracts.
The "miraculous" recovery of a surviving Peshawar massacre student
A paralysed teenager after being shot four times in Pakistan's most successful terrorist attack has succeeded in a "miraculous" recovery after following treatment in the United Kingdom.
Mohamed Ibrahim Khan, 13 years old, told Pakistan's doctors that he would never be able to run again.
At least 140 people, most children, were killed when armed men attacked the public school of the Peshawar army last December.
Mohamed, who arrived in London last month for surgery, will be released later from the hospital.
Just nine months ago, on a regular morning in March, Mohamed sat at the first aid hour and listened carefully to the teachers.
At the same time, seven armed men in the uniforms of the security officers entered the public school of the army.
He carried out hundreds of explosives and had to carry out a simple mission: to kill all the men, women, and children who went out of the way.
"I can't forget what happened that day," says Mohamed with a sharp look.
I was in the amphitheater, I asked questions... then I heard guns outside.
Terrorists entered and began to kill. Our professor was burned alive.
Mohamed describes how he took four students out of the amphitheater while the carnage took place.
Then he says he heard his friend, Hamza, yelling at him.
She said, "Oh, brother, save me."
I held him by the hand.
Then I was shot in the back, and he was in the head.
Most of those killed in the attack were students.
Hamza died in Mohamed's arms.
Mohamed recalls that immediately after that he disappeared and that the next thing he knew was that he was on a hospital bed, paralyzed from the chest down.
Doctors from Peshawar north of Pakistan, then those from Rawalpindi, almost capital, told his family that there was no treatment and that he would never be able to go again.
"When I saw him, I felt my soul came out," said Sher Khan, Mohamed's father.
Those nine months were the hardest of my life.
But Khan and his wife, Sherbano, refused to believe that their son would never be able to use his legs so passionately.
They campaigned and asked for help from Pakistani television, attracting the support of famous people such as Imran Khan, a critic who became a politician.
Finally, they managed to stretch funds to take Mohamed to the United Kingdom and offer him treatment at the private Harley Street clinic in London.
The neurosurgery consultant Irfan Malik described Mohamed right when he arrived at the hospital.
"You have spent the last [some] months weeping in bed, without being able to move from one side to the other," says Malik.
He was weak, he put a lot of pressure on his back.
He wasn't in a very good shape.
A vertebre from the base of Mohamed's vertebral column was destroyed
Mohamed was shot in the shade, in the back and back during the attack, and the lower vertebral column was destroyed, leading to the parallel.
However, during a six-hour operation, Malik and his team were able to re-read the nerve endings and rebuild the damaged part of the column.
Even Malik was surprised at what happened next.
Just a week after the operation, Mohamed grew up and began to walk and walk.
We didn't expect such a good outcome.
It was a miracle," she says.
In less than two weeks of operation, Mohamed is ready to leave the hospital and start the long recovery process.
Mohamed challenged his fate and began to run again
He wants to become strong and continue his studies in the United Kingdom.
But it is decided to return to Pakistan, join the army and fight terrorism.
"I feel I still have a chance of life," he says, showing the images with weapons drawn from him next to school manuals and styles
Physically, Mohamed becomes more and more powerful every day, but the psychological trauma that goes through and now is unimaginated.
"My wife didn't fall," he confessed.
In my school, little kids were killed.
What crime did they commit?
His mother weeps and eats him up and says, "I see my son coming back."
He'll be able to keep his life going.
The 4G "Super Voice" service from Three offers better signals
Three uses a 4G spectrum with a higher frequency, which can cover a wider area
The three mobile phone provider launched a service in the United Kingdom that says you will improve reception in buildings and rural areas without signs.
The 4G Super Voice service allows customers to make calls and send text messages using a more frequent spectrum.
And other networks intend to introduce the same technology, known as "Voice Over Long-Term Evolution (VolTE)".
This works only for Samsung Galaxy S5, but recent iPhone phones will benefit from it in the following months.
Three points out that up to 5.5 million customers will have access to service by 2017.
Chief of Technology, Bryn Jones said: “By the end of the year, one million of our clients will have access to a better inside cover and they will be able to use their phones in more places than they have so far."
The views are ready for the pantomime season.
The pantomime stage is very important for the theatres throughout the United Kingdom, many of them are now preparing for the season this year.
Now, at the Christmas theatre participates some of the biggest names in the show business.
Matthew Kelly and Hayley Mills will appear in the funeral - first in the role of one of the black sisters, and second in the role of the soul.
This reveals the secrets of their pantomimes at BBC Breakfast.
Steven Wilson: "If I don't do anything, I feel guilty"
Steven Wilson has recently been appointed to the great winner of the Progressive Music Awards
Steven Wilson was named several times as the most professional musician in the progressive rock world.
The musical talent won three awards at Progressive Music Awards, which took place this month in London, while also the award for the best album of the year for Hand.
In its five-star review, The Guardian called the album "a smart, expressive and captivating art opera".
In the 1980s, Wilson is the most famous music project engine, the most famous of them being the Porcupine Tree rock band.
Now, before two shows with the house closed at Royal Albert Hall, Wilson launchs a double LP just in wine format, Transience, to show the "more accessible" side of his solo activity.
He told the BBC about his love for wines and his loaded program and explained how the comedy actor Matt Berry came to open his shows.
What does guilt mean for you?
I grew up right at the end of the vinyl era, and I remember that I was just waiting for the CD's appearance, because the vinyl was so exciting.
You bought a disc, you went home with him, had a sweater, and you had to bring him back.
I love CDs, and for some types of music, for example classics, they're better than wines.
But the problem with CDs and digital downloads is that there is nothing you can really value.
Having a vinyl is like having a nice table set up in the sweater.
It's something you can hold in your hand, while you're left absorbed by verses and combined by the artistic act.
I thought it's just a nostalgic thing, but it doesn't have to be like this if some kids too young to remind themselves of the viniles they like this kind of experience.
Do you have any guilt that you especially have?
I admit I escaped all the vines in the '90s.
All the wines I've bought again.
I started with the idea of renewing the collection that I had when I was 15 years old, but I passed that limit.
The first disc I convinced my parents to buy it was out of the Blue from Electric Light Orchestra.
If I had still had the original copy, it would have had a sentimental value, but, unfortunately, it's somewhere in a charity store.
Steven Wilson hopes the album will be a port to possible new fans
Why did you launch your new Transience complication on wine?
This was originally designed as an idea for the Day of Speech Magazines, but I missed the occasion.
My speech house suggested that I add some of my shorter and more accessible melody.
I've come to be easily obsessed with the idea of doing something kind of "introduction into Steven Wilson's music" and I kept the project open only on the wine.
Who buys the wine also receives, and a variant downloaded to the high resolution.
Are you worried that the album won't show your music in her real light?
No, because, although I focus on the longer music pieces, there's one thing I've always valued more than anything: the melodic part.
There is a lot of progressive rock that focuses more on technical complexity than on the melodic side.
Pink Floyd, the most famous progressive rock band of all times, passed the time test due to the fact that they always placed the emphasis on the melodic side and the atmosphere.
What are you preparing for the Albert Hall show?
I don't want you to reveal too much.
The repertoire will be completely different every night.
First, there'll be a version of the show's Hand. Ease... that I had this year, but on steroids, with a few guests.
The second night is going to be worse a little in my history, this being more guided by the fans who have been following me for years.
How did you choose Matt Berry to open your show on the second night?
And me and the rest of the tour team are great fans of [the series of comedy on Channel 4] Toast of London, to the point where we always quote from it.
I thought I'd listen to Matt's music, so I bought his album, Music for Insomniacs.
We talked to him about our common love for Mike Oldfield and asked him to sing at Royal Albert Hall.
I think I'm extremely lucky to have him open.
You've rescinded the albums of some bodies such as XTC, Ters for Fears and Yes.
How much does this affect your own music?
I don't feel conscious about it, but, of course, when you construct these classic albums, they keep you in mind.
My last solo album, The Raven That Refused to Sing, was, no doubt, the most progressive old school album I've ever created.
I don't think it was a coincidence that I remigrated King Crimson, Jethro Tull and Yes almost all year ago.
The current album, Hand. Erase., is much more open, because I worked at Ters for Fears and XTC.
Many times you're described right to the most progressive rock music ever occupied.
Is that how you feel?
You can remove the progressive word.
I think I'm probably one of the most obsessed people in the music world today and I'm not proud to say that because, please believe me, it's a blow.
I think I inherited this from my father, who has an incredible work ethic of power.
If I don't do anything all day, I'm starting to feel guilty.
That's why work on remixtures was a but, because it means I don't have to do all the time just my music.
The music industry is a hard place to do your career.
Now I wouldn't recommend this to anyone as a prophecy.
I work daily and I'm not rich, but I live well.
I love what I do, it's a privilege, but if I'd been lazy, I don't think I'd have survived.
Transitence will be launched in the United Kingdom on 25 September.
Steven Wilson will sing at Royal Albert Hall on 28 and 29 September, as part of his European tournament 2015-2016.
A new contract reduces jobs in Skytrans
New Skytrans re-enacted a part of the airline's staff who lost their job when old Skytrans went into failure.
Skytrans, the company renegotiated north of Queensland, contributed a 25 million-dollar contract to transport the QGC's natural gas company's employment, which meant 18 members of the team had recovered their jobs.
Skytrans, owned by the Wild family, became very active in January, after the Newman government rewarded the subsidised routes that form a large part of the airline's business.
The failure of many communities to face an isolation potential, and Warren Entsch, a national-liberal federal parliamentarian for northern Queensland, was the representative voice of the national-liberal government's criticisms.
Another company, Collings Aircraft Holdings, released Skytrans brand in March.
Michael Thinee, Executive Director of Skytrans, said that the airline contract with QCG has already created jobs.
"We have been able to regroup 18 Skytrans personnel with the whole standard, as pilots and team members," he said.
We are also pleased to have a new staff, with direct logistics experience in managing the operations for QGC clients.
In just five months, we increased by 100% labour force, 78 staff members being employed in Cairns and now in Brisbane.
The contract continues to extend Skytrans operations from its central headquarters in Cairns, which serves the capital of York and Torres, and includes a base in Brisbane.
Skytrans will operate 18 flights a week for the QGC staff and for the companies from Brisbane to the locations of Chinchilla and Tauroom, in its Dash-8 from 36 locations, starting from Monday, October 26.
Tony Nunan, Executive Director of the QGC, said Skytrans received the contract following a tender procedure.
"We are pleased that this contract will contribute to the extension of a company in Queensland," he said.
The Skytrans contract maintains high-quality and consistent flight services to support our operations and projects.
Liberal Parliamentary and Motherhood Kelly O'Dwyer receives advice to make a bigger reserve of milk to avoid voting in the Chamber
Looks like there's gonna be more women in the cabinet.
Malcolm Turnbull's new government will be busy months and there are strong signs that more women will take the portfolios.
One of the government's views on the rise of the government, Kelly O'Dwyer, has received the advice to make a larger reserve of milk for her newborn to avoid joining in her duties in Parliament.
The advice comes from the responsibility with the government's discipline, Scott Buchholz, who later consulted the labyrinth to find out which is the most appropriate approach for a parliamentarian who adapts, in accordance with the existing orders.
Liberal Parliamentary Kelly O'Dwyer with her daughter, Olivia.
In accordance with the regulations in force - the set of rules governing the behaviour of parliamentarians in the Chamber - the mothers who adapt to a vote in Parliament.
This means that their vote is considered valid even when they are not present in the Chamber.
But Whip didn't know about this exoneration before he consulted the responsibility of the opposition's discipline, Chris Hayes, on this issue.
The events took place on two occasions when O'Dwyer could not participate in a division meeting and could not fulfil his obligation to hold a speech because the arrest was just started.
On one of these occasions, her team was asked if the parliament was planning to make a reservation for bigger milk instead of accommodating.
Scott Buchholz, parliamentarian of Queensland, is responsible for the government's discipline.
Finally, the two resolved the dispute.
Both refused to comment when they were contacted by Fairfax Media, but separate sources from Buchholz and O'Dwyer declared for Fairfax Media that the representative of the Higgins Division was angry when they were told to make a bigger baby reserve instead of joining their daughter Olivia, born in May.
This fact is revealed even when new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is working on the arrival of his new cabinet.
Buchholz, a national liberal parliamentarian in Queensland, was promoted as responsible for discipline by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, as part of the negative effect of the censorship attempt in February of this year.
O'Dwyer, in image with Amanda Rishworth of the Laburist Party and her son, Percy, is one of the three mothers of Parliament.
The one responsible with the discipline, Phillip Rudddock, was dismissed only a few days after Abbott faced a censorship motive by which he wanted his removal from office, being replaced by Buchholz.
Another supporter of Abbott, Andrew Nickolic, the Freeman of Tasmania, was also promoted and appointed responsible with the attached discipline.
Nickolic kept track of the newspaper's first page lately, after he discovered that he had sent to Turnbull a message he wanted to reject to challenge Abbott's leadership.
In August, O'Dwyer returned to Parliament for the first time after her daughter, Olivia, was born in May.
It is one of the three parliamentarians who became mothers this year.
The spokesman for the Laburist Party, Catherine King, said Wednesday that the vote for the mothers who are in love was introduced when her son was a baby.
"Now [seven years]," she wrote on Twitter.
The responsibility for discipline should have been known.
O'Dwyer was promoted in the office at the end of last year and can be promoted under Turnbull, who said Wednesday he wanted more women in his cabin.
"No one wants to see more women in terms of power, influence, in Parliament, in the ministry, throughout the country," said the prime minister in front of Parliament's reporters.
Abbott included one woman in his first cabinet and, after the pressure supported to increase female representation in the Coalition, promoted a second woman in the cabinet after the remand in December.
Five things you want the business environment from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull
Malcolm Turnbull: How will the markets react?
Mal Maiden, editor at BusinessDay, examines the impact Malcolm Turnbull might have on Australia's business sector.
Tuesday, the lobby groups in the business sector did not know how to express their enthusiasm when Malcolm Turnbull took over the country's profits as prime minister.
The main reason is that a large part of what many of them would have wanted to see abandoned fumes under Tony Abbott's leadership.
Or just arrived in a negotiated suspension due to Abbott's political "crash-or-crash-through" style.
Representatives of interest groups spoke to the Union about their hope in Turnbull's ability to satisfy public interest, reach a political agreement and do good works.
So what exactly awaits the country's largest companies and their representatives of our new prime minister?
CHAFTA will be a first test of Turnbull's ability to overcome negative publicity.
Turnbull himself set the right to start the free trade agreement with China.
In his first speech in which he announced in the medium of this provocation, the Free Trade Agreement between China and Australia (ChhaAFTA) represented the central point of his attack on lab leader Bill Shorten.
In a speech in August, Turnbull criticised "revolving economic scivilism" by the Laburist Party on the issue and expressed concern over the racist attempt of the critics.
"In the context of CHAFTA, winners are, numerically, much more than losers," he said in the same speech.
The business environment expects him to win this debate.
Don Argus, a legendary representative of the business environment, stressed that this is an essential point, being supported, among others, by the Australian Business Council (which represents the largest 100 companies in the country) and by James Packer, the billionaire of the gambling industry.
The business environment wants to conclude this agreement, and this will be a first test for Turnbull's ability to overcome negative advertising and to negotiate with the whole Senate.
The Minister for Small Enterprises, Bruce Billson, supports the recommendations of the Harper Analysis.
This could still lead to some discrepancies with the business environment.
The impact assessment shall apply in the case of large mergers and other contracts, to decide whether consumers will suffer from the lack of competition.
It is referred to as ‘assessment of the effects’ because it takes into account not only the company’s actions and intentions, but also the effect it will have on competition and the market.
The manner in which this evaluation is drawn up is extremely important for the result.
The Harper competition law analysis recommends a change in the impact assessment, which will make it more difficult for large corporations to remove smaller operators from the market.
The government led by Tony Abbott was on the side of the Australian Trade Council and the major trade unions.
Turnbull now realizes that he wants the entire cabinet to think about what he's going to do next.
CAA failed to say that if Turnbull follows Harper's analysis recommendations, consumers will need to pay higher prices.
It is ironic that the whole business environment is the one that the new prime minister suggested to have greater respect for the cabinet processes, what Turnbull seems to do by letting Bruce Billson, the Minister for Small Enterprises (which is on the part of Harper's recommendations) support his arguments in front of his colleagues.
Mediterranean diet could contribute to the prevention of cancer at the hospital.
Spanish researchers followed women aged between sixteen and eight years.
Those who eat primarily plants, fish and meslin oil and reduced the risk of cancer to the health.
Terrence Howard puts the multiplicity table under the question mark
Terrence Howard thinks I understand completely wrong arithmetic.
The negative person from the Empire declared for Rolling Stone magazine that he doesn't think one or the other is equal to one.
"How is it equal to one?" he said.
If one does one, it means that two has no value, because one or both he has no effect.
Once I do two, because the square root of the four is two, so what is the square root of the two?
It should be one, but we're told that it's two, and that's impossible.
Terrence, we don't understand what you mean.
Surprisingly, Howard's professors did not agree with his theory, so he gave up at Pratt Institute, where he studied chemical engineering.
"I mean, you can't close your eyes when you know something's wrong," he explained.
Howard found for his parallel approach on mathematics the name "Terryology".
The actor boasts that he spends his time painting and reassembles his charms, candles, magnets and plastics to illustrate the theory "one or one" and other similar theories of his.
He declared for the magazine that he and his wife, Mira Pak, had spent up to 17 hours a day believing these illustrations.
Editor Rolling Stone described Howard's creations right "with more complex, bidimensional and three-dimensional shapes, linked to them with copper or magnetic resins".
Howard says, among other things, that he hopes to receive American short 20150079872 A1 (“Systems and methods for improved construction tools”).
Also, the actor from "After an idol" says that Pitagora Einstein and Tesla would "take it apart" if he saw Terrilogy.
"You know," he says, "I've been asking me since I was three and a half years old why does a bull get around?"
Why doesn't it become a triangi or a portrait?
I understand why.
Howard added that he's hoping to change the course of education.
"This will be the last century in which our children will learn that once they do one," he said.
They won't need to grow in ignorance anymore.
Twenty years from now, they'll know that one or two do.
We're on our way to discover a new truth.
The universal mathematical truth.
We'll check in any 20 years.
Ariana Grande imitates Britney Spears at Wheel of Impression
Tuesday, during the "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon", Ariana Grande perfectly imitated Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.
The 22-year-old pop singer sang a little at Fallon's Wheel of Impression, interpreting "Mary Had a Little Lamb" as Spears, and then showed the lyrics with the song "The Wheels on the Bus" sung with Aguilera's voice.
On his side, Fallon did a good job in imitation of Sting and Aaron Neville.
The two also interpreted versions of "I Can't Feel My Face" from The Weeknd.
This week, Grande's name is still in print.
On the same day he went to Good Morning America, where he opened the show with the incident of the goose.
Taco Bell hopes that "Cantina" restaurants where wine will be used to become points of urban interest
You want to spend an elegant night in town?
Taco Bell is an option.
On 22 September, the fast food restaurant chain in Mexican style will open a new location in the Wicker Park area of Chicago, offering a menu of typical aperitives, a freshly painted local artist and even alcoholic drinks.
It is the first test location of the "Taco Bell Cantina" restaurant, which is directed to young people, concentrated increasingly in the city centers.
Taco Bell, which has about 6000 restaurants in the US, has its roots mainly in the suburbs and is associated with cheap food, prepared fast, such as Doritos Locos Taco, extremely popular.
With an average Taco Bell payment note of 7 USD, the company used drive-through service and fast service to attract the number of customers needed to profit.
But Taco Bell says that, in order to address new generations, "searching for more central urban media to live, work and enjoy", testing sites must follow a different model, with smaller spaces and more expensive options.
To make a drive-through, you need land.
Can you imagine what it means to buy a landcrew in a area like Wicker Park?
"You won't be allowed," said for USA TODAY Neil Borkan, French Taco Bell who will operate the location in Chicago.
At the location of Chicago, the new menu will be prepared with traditional Taco Bell offers, in an open kitchen, where "you can see your own food" before it is ready, said for Associated Press Meredith Sandland, head of development at Taco Bell.
Also, wine, beer and frozen alcoholic beverages will be served in the new location, following the recent example of many of Taco Bell's competitors.
Now, seventy-five Starbucks cafes offer "nighttime" menus that include beer, wine and taste.
One thousand of the about 1900 Chipotle restaurants offer alcoholic beverages.
The company stated that another location Taco Bell Cantina will open in San Francisco next to AT&T Park this month, replacing drive-through service and parking with an internal court and a window for sale.
These changes in location, atmosphere and annex indicate that fast food restaurant chain wants to attract other types of customers outside those looking for fast food at night.
Taco Bell decided for the first time on a higher quality cooking line in 2012, when opening Cantina and Burritos more expensive menu to compete with Chipotle, the project was supported by a advertising campaign based on the content of the new preparations.
If they succeed, Cantina restaurants will represent another step to a higher level.
Taco Bell said that until 2022, he intends to open 2,000 restaurants in the US.
As Sandland said for AP, "some hundred" of these will be "Cantina".
They're pushing the phones in the middle of the night: Elton John makes Putin's court
Russian President Vladimir Putin contacted Elton John a few days ago, just a few days after the British artist publicly said he wanted to interview Russian politicians to discuss the old Russian law together.
The British gay singer, declared gay, tried without success to get an interview with Putin while in Russia in November 2014, one year after he challenged the protests in this country and supported the second concert in 2013, a period in which he was involved in the history of this country, after adopting conflicting laws that prohibit "homosexual propaganda" in the minority.
In 2014, at St. Petersburg, British artist criticized these laws and made in front of fans the following statement: "If I'm gay, I've always felt welcome here in Russia."
If I hadn't been honest with what I am, I couldn't make these songs.
They don't mean gay propaganda.
They represent the way I express life.
If we start to punish people for something like that, then the next world will lose humanity.
Last Saturday, the artist took it that he wanted to get in touch with Putin to discuss this controversial matter.
So far, there is no clear information about the telephone discussion among the two personalities.
Cocos has "sung" all in the ANRP directory
Businessman Dorin Cocos is trying to save himself from an intrusion, "cantating" in front of the judges and detailing how he divided the euro millions of former members of the ANRP Commission.
Last night at the Inalta Court of Casatie and Justice in the file in which he was tried by his son or Alin Cocos, former head of DIICOT Alina Bica and former members of the Central Commission for the Establishment of Disappearances under the ANRP, Dorin Cocos was attacked by the fulger of sincerity.
He acknowledged all the charges and told the judges in hand how he helped businesswoman Gheorghe Stelian in the case of ANRP's disappearances, instead of seeking to be judged more quickly and taking account of his collaboration.
Thus, Cocos showed that he had known Gheorghe Stelian since 2006 and that he became involved in this after more real estate business.
He explained that Sergius Diacomutu met him in 2010, and he told him that he was working at ANRP.
I later found out that (Diacomoutu, n.r.) is Vice-President, and because Gheorghe Stelian had a file on the ANRP, I asked him to help us.
I promised her money, $2.5 million, the money I told her I'd give her in more.
I promised him and supported him politically, so that he would be able to act.
"Diacomou told me that he was helping me, but he needs support," said Dorin Cocos in the courtroom.
He also said that, through his knowledge, he had entered into the relationship with Crinuta Dumitrian, who was then head of the Central Commission of Despagubire, which promised him 800,000 euros.
For Gheorghe Stelian's second file, I knew it wanted to get over $300,000.
Diacomou has already had political support, I've given it and five million euros.
Crinute Dumitrean a million euros, Dragos Bogdan gave him 800,000 euros.
I'm sure all this money was put in transit, so I'm sure the file will be resolved.
"That's what I told them: to solve the file, to put it away," said Cocos.
Asked why he was able to do these things, Dorin Cocos said he received eight million euros for the positive resolution of the second file of Gheorghe Stelian.
I got, for the second file, eight million euros to solve the problem, but I only got EUR 1.2 million.
In 2013, I also met Alina Bica.
"I never talked to this money or land," said Cocos.
He also showed that "it was of notice that the ANRP was all understood before the sitting."
I didn't have the emotion that they wouldn't vote positive.
All the functions were political in the ANRP, but I personally didn't help him politically on the Diacomou.
"I told him that I helped him politically just to calm him down," and Cocos concluded the statement.
Ponta brings the European Court of Justice to DNA
Prime Minister Victor Ponta was at the DNA last night, for just five minutes, while he sent new documents to the "Turceni-Rovinari" file.
Victor Ponta escaped from DNA with a document from the European Court of Justice
Convinced that the case prosecutor will receive a debate on the margin of the file in which it is sought for false entries under the private signature, complicated by tax evasion and saving money, Victor Ponta took his own initiative on DNA, although the documents that could have been sent to them by the lawyer.
It wasn't like that, asked the prosecutor had no time, the prime minister left after five minutes, while he left more documents to record.
I wanted to submit (to the dossier, n.r.) the decision of the European Court of Justice on 3 September, which explains what is going on with service award contracts.
I say we've done business, the prosecutor says we haven't done it, the European Court of Justice has told us to see us both, because, as long as the taxes have been paid, it's okay.
"From the point of view of the European Court of Justice, which is mandatory, certainly, for all EU vessels, we do not have a case here," Prime Minister Victor Ponta said, on the issue of DNA.
Ponta further stated that, in particular, the decision of the European Court should be applied if we are EU members.
Until then, the prime minister is waiting for the prosecutor to read the decision of the European Court and call it back to the hearings, but to give him an answer to his requests, thereby dissolving the file.
Johannis is happy with the untelevisioned mandate
In Romania today, there is no legal provision to force you to watch TV.
And don't even wear a device like that, since you pay you a TV charge once with the bill in energy.
Insa, if you're the head of the state, things change radically.
In practice, it is understood that the role of the President of Romania is also to be taken into account in the everyday realities.
President Johnis is placed in a full list in the office or from Cotroceni
Just like, to the surprise of even the closest people you know from the Cotroceni Palace, Klaus Johannis refused to have television in the presidential office.
And after not watching TV - no program, not even the RTL or Pro Sieben German post, the president does not listen to radio posts and does not read the newspapers.
In addition, it does not even receive "negative monitoring" which, for example, the predecessor or a request with priority.
Instead, Johannis is happy to receive only the report with the stars that put him in a positive light.
And along this computerized self-insulating, where the only spread is the access to the facebook, much more serious is the blockage to which, through its passiveness, the head of the state of imputation the entire activity of the Presidential Administration.
And that's because, although it's been that lovely time since its installation, Johannis has not signed more than half of the presidential administration's employees' statements.
What becomes an increasingly serious problem, both in human terms and in law.
Lines and Peace
Those in the presidential office are already clear that no one and nothing can stop the "feng shui" from the state security office.
Where it's quiet and peaceful.
What's right, just after the new hour without a minute (no more, no less!), tomorrow, when Sibi's ex-wife asks the officials to present.
A habit that probably didn't disappear from time to time when the capital of the city of Cibin was run.
And about the fact that Johannis doesn't want television in the office has already been born countless legends, being people from the Cotroceni Palace who have come to point to the variant that the president would try to avoid his monitoring.
Especially that there's no radio device.
Only that, at this rate, follows to meditate as carefully in the dark as possible, so that the lighting devices can also hide audio-video recording techniques.
Only OK
Another surprise from the Cotroceni Palace is the delivery to the head of the state only of the "psychiatry monitoring" of the president's activities.
I mean, if there's any good news about Klaus Johannis or his wife, the head of the state will get the boon of his continuation.
If not, no!
And more interestingly, it has been banned from "negative monitoring" under conditions in which, for example, Traian Basescu was recognized not only as the follow-up of night television broadcasts in which he was criticised, but the demand every morning, with priorities, negative news.
That doesn't mean the muscles like it helped him to something, but, that's what, the gist of content!
And at least he can never apologize that he was not well informed of alternative sources.
Not out, not confirmed
Now, so far, the lamurs and the mystery of why he doesn't want to see Klaus Johannis on TV.
Until then, it would be more important to resolve, regardless of the formula, the contractual situation of the office of the Presidency.
To be able to work here, they are obliged to sign a declaration of loyalty to the daughter of the head of the state in force and to sign and sign it.
Only that, from December and so far, Klaus Johannis has not signed to confirm even half of these declarations, although this must take place within 30 days.
So hundreds of employees, representing over half of the staff of the Cotroceni Palace, have a uncertain situation now.
Because, legally speaking, if the head of state does not sign the declaration personally, they should be given out.
It's just that all of them didn't get any negative opinion!
So, in other words, I can come by any Court of Auditors, who will find that, over half a year, hundreds of people have received their wages at least somewhere outside the law.
So far, the president has been elected if he has to go out or confirm his position, the decision will be strict.
The authorities declared that a teenager was on his way to an attack against Pope Francis during his visit to the US
The inspired plan of an ISIS youth to attack Pope Francis during his visit to the US was more "aspirational order" than operationally, confirmed a police source for Fox News Tuesday.
The 15-year-old boy was arrested in the Philadelphia area in August when the law enforcement authorities canceled the plan.
The plan is the same as the representative of Texas, Mike McCaul, the President of Internal Security, during a Sunday interview, declared a source for Fox News.
"We closely monitor the threats against the Pope for his visit to the United States," McCaul at "This Week" from the ABC said.
Pope Francis has not been mentioned for the specific retention of the plan in a bulletin.
of the FBI and the Department of Internal Security of 14 August, stating that the adolescent was planning to use more attackers, firearms and explosives, having as "a foreign defender during a high-level event".
It is mentioned in the Bulletin that the minority has been radicalised through social networks.
It is possible that a teenager may suffer from a mental illness, declared a source of the law enforcement authority for Fox News, but without giving specific details about the young man's disease.
Also on Sunday, McCaul acknowledged the potential for an attack by a so-called "single hole" at the national level and said it was informed by the Secret Services about a "secret strict location" for the Pope's visit.
And with this, there's a great danger of security... We, as the time approaches, I think we'll all be very careful and protect him when he gets to the United States.
Matt Dean from Fox News made this material.
The scale from the environmental period discovered in copper suffered a violent death, says experts
Irish archeologists have revealed the details of the strange scale from the average period, found at the height of a 215-year-old tree.
The Collowey's faggot, Sligo, fell during a storm that took place this year, bringing out to the light the dark sight of a skeleton caught between its roots.
The Irish National Monuments Service has brought experts from the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services to explore and analyze the remains, thus revealing a fascinating story.
"He was killed violent," said Marion Dowd, director of Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services, for FoxNews.com.
On the upper side of the chest, it's caused by bone injuries. It's got one such end in the left hand, which suggests she's trying to show up.
The scale is of a young man between the ages of 17 and 20.
Radiocarbon analysis shows that the remains are between 900 and 1000 years old.
"We can't tell if he was killed in battle or in a personal debate," says Dowd, noting that the body was buried after a Christian ritual, with the head directed towards the west.
"Probably it was grouped by family or community," she added.
Dowd said for FoxNews.com that the one who planted the tree didn't know about the dead.
"It was just a coincidence, the context is an unusual one," she said.
There are historical documents that prove that there is a church and a cemetery in the area, but today there are no visible consequences.
There is yet an unusual aspect of discovering: youth’s height.
"Avea 1 meter 77", says Dowd.
For temporary environmental society, that means a lot.
The federal government spends $1.5 million to study what babies think about food
National Health Institutes (NIH) spent nearly $1.5 million studying what little children think about food.
The project, called "The Way to Understanding Babies and Small Foods", was launched by the University of Chicago and has so far established that young people are not expected to eat cheap food from other people or those who have starved other people.
According to the project financier, "adequate food is important for healthy and longevity, but many Americans do not have healthy diets from a nutritional point of view".
There is evidence that the first feeding models of infants and young children have long-term consequences for the health of the entire life.
The premium for this study is that they lack research on how to feed babies.
"In spite of the complexity and significance of the food selection, psychiatry for the development of the child has devoted little attention to the study of how babies and young children understand, learn and understand food, the financier said.
The current proposal applies methods of cognitive development to test social impacts on the choice and consumption of food for infants and young children.
Researchers say that babies have "limited knowledge in the food sector".
Children aged between three and six years are "I know more about food than babies and young children", but they are "extramotor consumers".
An actress who played at "Star Trek: Voyager" is accused of indisputable exposure in Tennessee
An actress who played in the "Star Trek: Voyager" television series was arrested in east Tennessee, accused of being exposed to children.
More media channels report that the 41-year-old actress Jennifer Ann Lien, who played Kes's role in the television series, is accused of two innocent exposure crimes, involving children under 13 years of age, according to the arrest report.
The sheriff's office in Roane County brought the arrest warrant on September 3, at Lien's home in Harriman, where they say they found a goose under a cat on the couch.
The officers said Lien refused their demands to wear.
The chief of police in Harriman, Randy Heidle, says Lien's head has brought more charges, while the body beating in the form is severe, after the April incident where Lien says he entered a police car with his own car.
He still doesn't know if he's a lawyer.
Police identified the victim killed found in the Epping Forest
A man whose body was decomposed was discovered in a tourist forest was identified.
On 9 September, Hidir Aksakal, 53 years old, was found near Hollow Ponds in the Epping Forest in northern London.
The man of Turkish origin lived in Margate, Kent, and had close ties with the Green Lanes area of Haringey, north of London.
Last time he was seen in Green Lanes in the morning of the month, August 17th.
A post-mortem analysis has shown that he was killed, and detectives say his body is probably found for weeks in the Epping forest.
Inspector General Jamie Piscopo, from the metropolitan police, said: "Mr. Aksakal was well-known at the local level as the Cetin Boxer and we hope to find out from the Green Lane community information that will help us in research.
Hollow Ponds is a crowded and popular tourist place, where there is a cafe and a lake for boat trips.
It is also surrounded by intense traffic.
We invite all those who have been in the area for the past few weeks and may have noticed some unusual activity or will give us a break, to come and talk to us.
Super boss: six women joggle between motherhood and service
Apart from any other country in the world, with the exception of Papua New Guinea, there is no centralised policy on maternity leave paid in the United States.
Two weeks ago, when Yahoo's executive director, Marissa Mayer, announced that he was pregnant with men, but he was going to take his maternity leave very short and "work in" his free time, the woman of 40 years was criticized at a large scale to encourage a culture that awaits the superfeme or nothing.
But otherwise Mayer, she herself is a symbol of the top woman, to be guilty of unrealistic expectations?
How do other women's leaders manage?
Seema Patel, a lawyer and Deputy Director of the San Francisco Office for the Application of Labour Standards, just got a government job in Washington DC a few years ago, when her boss took her up with an unexpected offer.
"I don't know anything about you," said her boss.
But if you're going to make a family for you in the future, you're gonna need to pull your hand out now.
Patel's contractor was the federal government, and she didn't even receive a maternity grant paid as part of her employment contract.
At the time, Patel was unsatisfied and very focused on the career, and the family was the last thing he thought about.
But she listened to her boss's advice.
She avoided using her medical leave days for four years, so when she was pregnant with her first child, two years ago, she was three months old.
Six months ago, when the second child was born, Patel could no longer apply the same strategy.
The four months of concession that he took were totally unpaid.
Patel says he did not feel any opposition from her colleagues, but he has a problem with the structure of the work.
"I look very disappointing to anyone trying to have a family," she says.
Send a message: Your country does not place any value on the fact that you will become a parent.
Karen Choi, Vice-President of the Capital Group asset management company, says that any employed woman who is and mother needs to be blessed.
Choi, who has four children, one of whom is a six - month - old baby, describes the jungle between mother's quality and job right "a constant battle".
The secret to avoid stumbling is to have "a incredible family with you" and a good and a babysitter, to accept that there are things that are not going to be the best ("the whole world can be Martha at interior amension") and just go through it.
Choi says he's got a more maternity allowance for each child, starting from two and a half months for the first and ending with six months for the last.
This makes her an exception, especially in her field of activity.
When your child is sick, he has fever, vomiting, and you stay all night caring for him, and you know that the next morning you have to take the other kids to school, then go to the service...
Then it becomes very complicated," she says.
However, her company supported her and said that the performance of her investment portfolio was only suffering.
When she went into the finance industry, after university, about 20 of her college colleagues went the same way, she says.
Today, about 90% of them have given up.
Women who give up work, then again they don't have the same chances at well-paid top posts, she says.
It is difficult to remain: “In a short time it is a sacrifice, but in a long time the results are seen.”
Anyway, her children helped her to make this sacrifice, because all of her four children are girls.
One of the things that helps me go further is that I want to be a model for them.
The idea of being an example for her four children is what motivates her to research scientist and professor Kelly Posner, at the age of 48.
Children know that their mother helps, in fact, save the lives of human beings.
Posner, founder and director of the Centre for the Evaluation of the Risk of Synubs at Columbia University, says it is important for women to know that they can have a "target of greatness" in relation to their career and to fulfill it.
It's very important for women to think I can have a vision.
Most people don't believe this," she says.
He once held a presentation in front of 200 people, including government officials, in Italy during a web site when he was pregnant for eight months.
She also helped the technology, she says, that she may stop the car and answer the phone after taking the children or reply to an e-mail from the way.
The relationship between motherhood and a demanding career has been helped by an optimistic personality, focused on solving problems, she says. The ability to bring things to a good end even when this seems impossible.
Jennifer Epps-Addison, 33 years old, the Executive Director of Wisconsin Jobs Now and the mother of two children, says that doing maternity and career work together only through private support networks, such as bonding, is wrong.
"You shouldn't be lucky or winning lottery tickets to succeed," she says, describing the failure of the system to support women and families - mentioning very little wages, the weak health system and lack of a paid maternity leave.
"As a society, we don't care about others," she says.
We can't even guarantee the recovery of mothers who were just born.
Epps-Addison, who was pregnant while following the courses of law school, gave birth to the child when he received a scholarship.
With a husband and a child who was based on the medical assistance offered by the bus, the employer was able to take a maternity leave for just two weeks, then return to the service.
Lisa Mosko, a fashionist and mother of two children, says that less and less women will abandon their profession if they benefit from more social support, in the form of day care services from companies, keeping the programmes established by common agreement and accepting the fact that the work does not mean staying on programmes.
In the face of logistical constraints, says Mosko, there is an additional pressure to act in a domain where being a mother is sometimes Synonyms with the lack of taste (the "mother's dress" is one of the most serious insults).
"The image is part of our work - it lifts you up or throws you down," she explains.
Moscow's "permanent business" for its multiple roles to function harmonizing means to keep their appearance and a beautiful giant in hand, however, sometimes to fall into a double game.
If he remembers that men are also fathers, the company could allow women to do more.
People don't judge men that they're not good fathers as they judge women who are mothers.
Shola Olatoye, president and executive director of the New York housing authority, who is in charge of the housing of over 400,000 New Yorkeses and has over 11,000 employees, says maternity and career do not mean "equivalent".
The point of balance is a little inappropriate.
It looks more like a balance sheet," she says.
Mother of three children, one of whom has only three months, just took a maternity leave seven weeks after she was born this year.
"It was a very important period for the agency," she explains.
She knew that seven weeks won't be enough, but her husband managed to grant her maternity leave, and she managed to have a flexible program, which means to leave early or late, so she could join the child.
Olatoye, who starts with her friends every morning ending at 06:00 (“more mild as therapy”) still improves.
At the service, he tried to create a "friendly environment for parents" in which delay is allowed for a child, and the response to the e-mail must not be undefended from the office.
"The concept and the notion of the family have changed and changed a lot," says Olatoye.
"The family is very different from what happened 25 or even 10 years ago."
The job is the one that needs to be adapted.
Russian killers say they fooled Elton John about a phone from Putin.
For Chinese it seemed too beautiful to be true: a phone call from Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, to Sir Elton John, a singer and a militar for the rights of sexual minorities, in which to discuss homosexual rights.
Unfortunately for John, it was not true: despite an exuberant post on Instagram in which the Russian leader thanked him for addressing the problem, it became clear immediately that anyone would have called him last night, certainly not been Putin.
The Kremlin has already declared he has no knowledge of that conversation.
And Wednesdays, two famous Russian assassins recognized that they, not the president, were foreign voices from the other end of the conversation.
"We thought it was less likely that Putin would want to meet with him or call him, or at least not too soon," says Vladimir "Vovan" Krasnov, who imitated Putin, while his colleague Alexei "Lexus" Stoliarov, gave the president's speech spokesman, Dmitri Peskov.
"It seems to us that Elton John is really waiting for this phone, so he immediately thought that it was really a conversation with the right people we gave us," he said for the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.
He said: "Thank you, it was the surprise of the day."
This day and this conversation were the most wonderful and exciting of my life.
To break John's habit, the two announced that they would publish a record of the conversation at a popular Russian night show.
John's representatives did not make statements about the speculations.
On the basis of the story, the comments made by the singer on the weekend, in which he criticized Putin for his "ridicoly" attitude towards homosexuals while the LGBT rights military in Kiev, especially a Russian law adopted in 2013, prohibiting the dissemination of "promotions for non-traditional sexual relations" among minorities.
"I would like to meet him [in Putin], to speak," John told the BBC, saying that, although the idea was "probably unrealistic", it deserved an attempt.
Then, last night, the song shocked some observers when he posted a message on a social network, claiming Putin answered his criticism by phone and calling him.
He said that "he looks forward to meeting him in front of [the president] to discuss the LGBT equality in Russia."
Unfortunately for John, not Putin was the one from the other end of the line, but Stoliarov and Krasnov, known for phone numbers in play by many Russian and Ukrainian politicians and politicians.
Stoliarov, who speaks English, played Peskov's role and claimed to be the interpreter of the two.
When asked about the possibility of a conversation, the true Peskov told reporters Tuesday that Putin would "prepare to meet Elton John and answer all his questions", but that Kremlin received no such request from the singer.
The Kremlin had reason to question the authenticity of the Instagram post, he added, “especially because it is not written in the whole of a correct English”.
We don't think Sir Elton John would have written the same error of grammar.
Even before the two Russians declared their public flag, local media had already denied that John was the victim of a joke.
Some users of the online environment identify him as guilty of Krasnov, known for the jokes made by politicians who register them and post them on their YouTube channel like Vovan222.
The phone calls to audiences, then the publication of registrations became a real phenomenon in Russia in recent years.
Stoliarov, who is considered by many to be the founder of the race, developed the talent to make Ukrainian politicians.
He was interviewed on the phone on Ukrainian television by stalking Anton Gerașchenko, the direct adviser to the Minister of the Interior, Arsen Avakov.
He did so well on Gerașchenko, as last year spoke to former governor of Dnipropetrovsk, Ihor Kolomoiski, better than six hours in more days.
Krassnov became known after the 2011 parliamentary elections, which led to massive street protests after massive fraud reports.
When Arkadi Dvorkovich, then president's adviser, Dmitri Medvedev, convinced President of the Electoral Commission, Vladimir Churov, that Medvedev intended to grant him.
In addition to many Russian celebrities, during his victims, former URSS President Mihail Gorbaciov, Prime Minister of Kiev, and the Vitali Klitschko campaign and the Russian Ministry of Sport Vitali Mutko, who failed to apologize for his behavior in the performance of his athletes.
Last year, Krasnov would have called on the President of Belarus Aleksandr Lukașenko, giving his son to Ukrainian leader Demis, Viktor Ianukovici.
It was so convincing that the person from the other end, whose voice like Lukașenko, offered him asylum.
John's initial statement that he would like to discuss with Putin caused a terrible reaction in Russia.
The lawyer Vitali Milonov of St. Petersburg, who contributed to the law on "propagandism", said for The Guardian that John should not bother Putin with a "so insignificant" subject and that he was ready to meet with the singer to explain the position of Russia.
The Moscowsky Komsomolets newspaper opened an online poll for readers, with 39% of respondents thought that Putin and John should meet, and 22% considered that the same meeting would give Putin's reputation.
A new study shows that more people die from air pollution than malaria and HIV/AIDS
According to a new reference study, over 3 million people per year die prematurely from air pollution outside, more than malaria and HIV/AIDS combined.
The main cause, especially in Asia, is wood and coal for heating and cooking, but research reveals that a similar alarm is the agricultural emissions of Europe and the US, where it represents the main cause of these deaths.
The report warns that unless measures are taken, the number of deaths - already equivalent to six deaths per minute - will double by 2050.
"These projects should mark an alarm for public health agencies all over the world," said Professor Michael Jerrett, an environmental expert at the University of California, who was not involved in research.
Most of the deaths caused by air pollution are caused by small particles, which can be deeply inhaled in the lungs.
These cause heart disease and stroke, which are responsible for three quarters of the 3.3 million deaths per year, while the rest are caused by lung cancer and respiratory diseases.
The research did not include the effects of internal air pollution, such as gas fires, which is estimated to cause yet another 3.4 million deaths per year.
The new study, published in the Nature newspaper, was the first to highlight various sources of external pollution and estimated the number of premature deaths caused by them, taking into account road traffic, fuel-based centres and other sources.
Researchers have used a computerized model of the global atmosphere to assess the impact of air pollution on the various populations, including new information on how pollution affects China and India.
One third of all premature deaths were the result of the use of smoke-depleting fuels, such as wood and coal, for heating the locations or gases, and of the use of dry diesel generators for electricity, all of which are recognised risks.
This type of internal energy consumption causes half of India's 645 000 annual deaths and one third of China's 1.4 million annual deaths.
But the research found that the agricultural emissions of ammonia had a "remarkable" impact, according to Professor Jos Lelieveld of the Chemical Max Planck Institute of Germany, which led the research.
Five of the deaths at global level are caused by these emissions, mainly from live birds and pigs and over-use of fats.
Ammonia reacts to emissions from traffic and industry and produces small particles, mainly due to the pollution of the U.S., Japan and Europe.
"To London, agriculture is the main source," says Lelieveld.
In the United Kingdom, 48% of premature deaths were the result of agricultural pollution.
Traffic-generated pollution is still an important factor in developed countries, causing five deaths, despite measures against pollution vehicles.
This has only caused 5% of deaths worldwide, but the number could increase as more cars appear on the streets in developing countries.
Air pollution by centres, in particular those operating with coal, was significant at global level, causing one of the seven deaths.
In the U.S., the main factor is one third of the 55,000 deaths per year, compared to 16% in the United Kingdom.
The natural air pollution, especially in the arid and highly prairie regions, has caused nearly a fifth of the deaths worldwide due to air pollution.
This source represents a major factor in some arid countries, which is responsible for 92% of the deaths in Egypt and 81% in Iran.
"Supposing between the high rate of pollution and the large number of residents says the word about public health, but it is no longer known about the sources of pollution responsible for premature death," Jerrett says.
The results are surprising and important for the protection of public health at the global level.
It is now assumed that all particles are of the same toxicity.
But if fuel burning causes are more toxic, as some scientists say, the percentage of premature deaths that can be attributed to agricultural emissions would be smaller.
Even so, Jerrett says "the discovery is very valuable... because agriculture has not been generally seen as a major source of air pollution or premature deaths and because it suggests that more attention should be paid to agricultural sources, both from science and political responsibilities."
Dr. Oliver Wild, an atmospheric specialist at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, said: "The study actually highlights the need for air quality control to avoid these deaths, especially in highly populated areas of Asia".
Victor Ponta's statement of tension and more relations with Hungary
Budapest asks Ponta to attack lies, the Roman Prime Minister speaks of attitudes that bring to mind Nazism
The relations with Hungary, already tense after the announcement of the construction of a garden with Romania, after the sarba granite, were known a new depreciation following the statements made by Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who accused the authorities of Budapest of treating refugees "with beating and insertion".
Hungarian diplomats have reacted hard by speaking about the "extremist and false" claims, but neither did Victor Ponta leave himself alone and accused government officials from the country of being "a Russian" for Europe.
Notably it is not for the first time when Ponta tries to tense the Roman-engage relationship through declarations made at delicate times or with electoral character.
It all started with a statement made by Victor Ponta, in which he tries to argue that Romania can't receive more than 1,800 refugees.
Your problem with our logistic ability to treat these people like some people, not how it treats our magic neighbors, with battle and insinuated.
I don't agree with that.
Mr. Basescu put himself in front of an angry and hostile feeling that exists in all societies, and that is a xenophobic feeling.
It's very good to have a debate, but it's our job to solve the problem.
"We'll treat these people as we do," said Victor Ponta, quoted by the Truth.
It is not clear what Victor Ponta referred to when he spoke about the insertion of refugees, but Cehia was recently in the centre of criticism after writing the numbers on the migrant manuals found in several trains, in a gesture that reminded the Nazi procedure to identify the Jewish prisoners of the concentration camps.
Peter Szijjarto appreciated, according to the MTI News Agency, taken by Magyardok.hu, that probably internal political crises that have undermined Victor Ponta's position make it a "extreme and false" statement.
The Romanian business insurgent from Budapest was invited to offer explanations, mediafax informing MTI.
"Mr. Victor Ponta has recently made inadequate statements on how Hungary manages the crisis of immigrants," explains the Hungarian Foreign Minister.
Levente Magyar, State Secretary for Foreign Trade and Foreign Affairs in Hungarian MAE, expressed "surprising" in connection with Victor Ponta's ongoing attempts to save his controversial moral position by anti-gaping lies," he underlined the diplomacy of Budapest.
"I don't want to respond to the provocations that come from some Hungarian government representatives - but read the report below and you will understand the anger it feels, as a man and a citizen of Europe, the girl of mentality and attitudes that Europe has seen in the 1930s-40s!" wrote Ponta, on Facebook account.
He argues that, like other European politicians, it is "the duty" to draw attention and punish "the constant behaviour of Hungarian top government officials" who are "a Russian for the culture and values of the European Union" by "anti-semit attitudes", "the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now in the refugee crisis!"
"The shampoo, aggressive laws, closures and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, political decisions are better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees are fleeing!", Ponta accused, claiming that he believes in "soliability, rational and sustainable, and especially in the superiority of European values" and "to see in recent days in Hungary is in complete contradiction with these objectives and values!"
During the series, Ponta was invited to Antena 3, where the main subject was Hungary.
If Mihai Gadea named Viktor Orban the black cow of Europe, a dictator, Ponta asked what would happen if the Magi army were attacked and shot or killed some children or some women, in a speech in which he made more references to Nazism.
In the debate, UDMR President Kelemen Hunor, who considers that the Roman authorities should not have a "sensitial approach" in relation to Hungary's intention to build a wall on the granite.
UDMR leader claims that it must be understood that this solution is not justified against Romania or the Roman states, he shows that the guard could even help our country not become an intense route transited by four migrants who will reach the Schengen area, according to Agerpres.
Firstly, I want to underline, to say, that we don't have to want to take all of this as something against Romania and that we don't have to use it to burn up any relationship between the two governments, because it's not the case.
I think any emotional approach, the visceral isn't okay.
"We need to see the rational part, see why we have come here and we need to know and say this, that it is not against us, it is not against Romania, the Roman states, and it does not prevent the free movement between the two states, within the EU," Kelemen Hunor said.
The news ignored Russia's offer to launch Bashar al-Assad from Syria's leadership in 2012
Russia has now proposed for more than three years the incarceration of the President of Syria, Bashar al-Assad, to be part of a peace agreement, in accordance with an official senior involved at that time in negotiations with the facilities closed between the Russian flag and the Russian Federation, writes The Guardian.
The former president of Finland and the Nobel Peace Prize winner, Martti Ahtisaari, said that the Western Powers have not benefited from the proposal since then.
From 2012 until now, tens of thousands of people have died and millions more have been forced to flee the country, thanks to the most serious crises of refugees since the end of the second world war.
Ahtisaari held talks with representatives of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (US, United Kingdom, France, Russian Federation, and China), in February 2012.
This further stated that during the discussions, the Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churchin offered a plan which included among others and Assad's proposal to give up power at a given time after the start of peace between the regime and opposition.
It proposes three things:
One -- we don't have to put up with the opposition.
Two - we need to start a dialogue between Assad and immediate opposition.
"Three - we have to look for an elegant way for Assad to withdraw," Ahtisaari said, referring to the position of the Russian ambassador.
Insa, he said that Ahtisaari, the United States, the British Sea and France were so convinced that the Syrian dictator followed each other, in spite of ignoring the Russian ambassador's proposal.
"It was a lost opportunity in 2012," the former Finnish president continued.
Officially, Russia strongly supported Bashar al-Assad for four and a half years, insisting that it could not represent a proposal in any peace agreement.
Assad believes that Russia will never leave him.
Moscow recently started sending troops, tanks and military aircraft to Syria, in an effort to stabilize Assad's regime and to face the extremes of the Islamic State.
The free Internet program at Antenei 3 will be available at cost
Antena 3 informed the viewers that from 1 November the program or live will be available online against cost, on the basis of a monthly subscription.
In a "recording to TV viewers", the post of Intact trust reports that "we're doing this with a strange heart, and we want to get rid of the waves and in this new stage, driven by the conditions of the foot".
According to the same message, the subscription will be 1 euro per month "for those of you who follow us online", the television promising that watching will be of very good quality.
Antena 3 argues that "all these transmissions directly from the ground and outlying, the campaigns, daily events were and are possible through a constant financial effort, assumed, which assumed a permanent retention and focus on quality".
We have been able to support ourselves, under conditions where offline and online distributors have contributed nothing for the continued offer.
The announcement comes under conditions in which the news television program is accessible on the basis of subscription and online platform Antena Play, where, on the other hand, it has been accessible to the most easily accessible and recording of the broadcasts from Anlene.
The reports show that the population of animals and marine plants has doubled over the past 40 years.
The scale of the crisis faced by marine animals and plants is documented in a study that states that marine species from around the world, including the essentials for the safety of human food, are in a decline that can be catastrophic.
Presses without prior directions at the global ocean ecosystem are combined and creates a difficult age for almost all marine life, says the WWF's "White Planeta Life" report.
Coral reefs are subject to serious risks of declin (WWF) Some marine habitats, such as mangroves and sea grass, which depend on many other species, have recorded a significant decline, while the whole population of fish with commercial value, such as macro and tonal, have fallen vertebrates with three shifts in the 1970s, shows the report.
Many coral reefs, usually described as tropical forests of the oceans due to their huge biodiversity, could be threatened with extinction by the end of this century if the ocean accident continues to worsen, as a result of the high levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, resulting in a proportional increase in the level of carbonic acid in the sea.
"Health measures are a source of extraordinary beauty and natural wonder and are also a basis for the functioning of the global economy," said Louise Heaps, chief marine policy consultant at WWF-UK, who contributed to the completion of the report.
"With excessive fishing, which undermines coastal habitats, and without solving the global warming problem, we plant seeds of an ecological economic catastrophe," says Dr. Heaps.
The report, based on a review of scientific literature published, but also on the Life Planet Index, a database maintained by the Zoological Society in London, is one of the most detailed studies on marine life ever undertaken.
Nearly 20% of the total mangrove areas have disappeared between 1980 and 2005 (WWF) This has researched a wide variety of marine species, from fish, marine mammals and sea-like animals, with sharp skin - to marine plants such as mangroves and algae.
The report found that the algae areas decreased by approximately 30% in the last century, while the total mangrove areas decreased by 20% between 1980 and 2005, mainly as a result of crop fishing and other forms of aquaculture.
Over a single generation, human activity has caused huge damage to the ocean, taking fish faster than it can reproduce and also destroying its banks.
There is a need for profound changes in order to ensure abundant ocean life in the next generations," said Marco Lambertini, Director-General of WWF International.
Some of the most dramatic declines have been recorded in the fisheries species for commercial profits.
For example, 58 populations of 17 species belonging to the Scrombidae family - macrou, ton and sardines - fell by 74% between 1970 and 2010, without signs of recovery, says the report.
We are in a course of fishing that could end with people being deprived of a vital food source and an essential economic engine.
Overfishing, the destruction of marine habitats and climate change have serious consequences for the entire human population, and poor communities, based on the sea, will be hit the fastest and most powerful," Lambertini said.
"The collapse of ocean ecosystems could trigger a serious economic decline and could undermine our fight to eradicate poverty and malnutrition," he continued.
Professor Ken Norris, ZL's Scientific Director, said: "These alarming figures show how rapidly the oceans change plants and animals and represent a clear warning of the problems we may encounter as a result."
Large grass: deep submarine "paces", which captures rich minerals and stabilizes the bottom of the sea.
Over the last century, the covered surface decreased by 30%.
Mangrove: Their existence is known in 123 countries, nearly half of the total area, representing only five countries.
Nearly 20% of the total mangrove areas have disappeared between 1980 and 2005, mainly due to human invasion.
Coral Reciples: Some of the richest and most productive habitats from a biological point of view on earth.
A portion of the whole marine species live in coral reefs or near them, but three parts of them are currently threatened and many can disappear during this century if the ocean accident continues to worsen.
Deeper habitats: it is known very little about the deep ocean areas, but the decline in fish stocks in these inaccessible places over the last 40 years suggests that they are also affected by global marine changes.
Steven Gerard denies the charges of racism that would have been brought to him by his former coach from Liverpool, El-Hadji Diouf
In a passage from his autobiography in "My Story" (My Story), serialized by Daily Mail, Gerard criticizes the Senegalese player saying "he's not really interested in football" and that he's the colleague who liked "at least" in the 17 years of the club.
In response, Diouf would have responded to Gerrard's radio station with several translations attributed to the attacker, who would have said that "Gerrard never liked color people".
Gerrard's lawyers denied any charges of racism brought to him.
In his most recent book, Gerrard, who made it public and before the bad opinion of Diouf, criticized the attitude and degree of professionalism of his former colleague.
"I don't want to waste my time thinking about El Hadji Diouf, but I have to mention his years spent at Liverpool as an example of how I can go on two," he writes.
"I don't think Diouf is really interested in football and he doesn't care much about Liverpool," he continued.
For example, the way he threw a big, mature flag into a Celtic fan in a Cupa Uefa game from the Parkhead in March 2003 is proof of his disgusting and lanchyunos behavior.
Diouf proved to be a controversial figure all the time spent on Anfield, his most famous night being the Celtic Park.
The Senegalese front was questioned by the police after the outbreak of the scythe and amended by two weeks' salary at the club, a total of 60,000 pounds being given to a humanitarian organization at Celtic's election.
In his previous autobiography, published in 2007, Gerard describes Diof as being Leneš and egoist.
"His attitude was completely wrong," Gerrard wrote.
I didn't feel like I was just going to do everything I could to help Liverpool get back to the top.
Diouf, who now plays at the Malaysian Sabah club, criticized Gerrard publicly and attacked Gerrard's old friend and co-shipper, Jamie Carragher.
In 2012, Diouf called Gerard "egoist" and claimed that none of Anfield liked the player who led the team to victory in the League of Champions in 2005.
Diouf is also quoted as saying Gerrard is "gelos".
He said: “Gerrard is just jealous of me.
He didn't reach the results I had in the football.
When I came to Liverpool, I came with the boss's status, and he lives there.
I'm respected in the football world, the biggest football experts have broken me between the first seven players at the World Championship and the first 100 players of the century.
Many big players don't have a sense of belonging.
Wherever I go in other countries, I'm welcome, while Gerard is Jewish several times leaving his native town Liverpool.
From the era of the dancer professional: quickly to Alek Skarlatos to "Dancing With the Stars"
In this season of “Dancing With the Stars”, Alek Skarlatos does not only play the role of the hero in uniform.
It is also a young, attractive and athletic type, equally discreet and modern, to the producers.
"There are many categories and we are always looking for the most popular of the time," said Deena Katz, executive co-producer of the ABC show.
I swear she'll find her prints after that.
It's fascinating.
He's got something special.
Before being competitiond at the famous show - but just a few weeks before - Skarlatos arrived at the international press after he took a serious risk.
He and his two childhood friends, Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler, mobilized a man armed with an AK-47 in a train full of passengers traveling from Amsterdam to Paris.
The three stopped what could have been a mass murder by a potential terrorist.
After that, Skarlatos, a 22-year-old saint in Sacramento, grew up near Sacramento, received a phone call from President Obama, a message on Twitter from Donald Trump and a dinner with Arnold Schwarzenegger and was decorated by the American army and the French government.
Although it may be anticipated that some local values - Friday at Sacramento, there was a parade in youth - did not expect such positive reactions or the invitation to participate in "Dancing With the Stars".
"No one in a million years would have thought I would receive this offer," Skarlatos said Saturday, in a break from the dance rehearsals together with his partner Lindsay Arnold.
I think it's all new and crazy.
Even if before the show last night he recognized that it was "slowly excited", he developed as a professional at his first foxtrot, getting points that brought him close to the front of the competition.
Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Julianne Hugh, who formed the jury, said he offered one of the best representatives of the series.
Katz and the executive producer at "DWTS" Rob Wade said they want to keep a free spot in the show for the last hundred meters invited competitors, as is the case of Skarlatos, who have grown in the eyes of the public.
In this case, Katz heard of the three American friends who were on vacation, who fired an armed attack on a train with 500 passengers and immediately decided to invite one of them to the dance contest.
He looked for social networks, found family members, and sent messages to Skarlatos.
When it appeared at "Good Morning America" to tell the incident during which Stone and other passengers were injured, Katz worked with the ABC's sister program to avoid crossing all media barriers.
And he supported the five-minute platform, and then he waited to find out if Skarlatos would agree to participate in the "DWTS".
"For a while everything was very uncertain, because this is so different from what he does," Katz testified.
Soon after the war in Afghanistan, and now I'm asking him if he has a dance boss.
Skarlatos, who is in a short concession from the National Guard, did not even see a whole show until recently.
He wants to participate, mainly because he doesn't want to be just a scotch in evidence.
The show could not invite all three friends.
But the producers had an ass in hand: Noah Galloway, war veteran, with hand and foot amputated.
They encouraged Skarlatos to call Galloway, the favorite fan and finalist of the past season, and ask him about his experience.
That must have been the critical point, along with Katz's unconvincing "saving" and "instinct messages", she said.
"Noah is a wonderful guy and I wanted to know how the army would be built and how my friends' image would be protected," Skarlatos said.
He told me I should go.
So, after that conversation, I accepted.
Skarlatos, a great sports and history lover, never dances until then, and Arnold has testified in interviews that he is trying to make him relax and give up on the military position quite hard.
But Katz says it's reassuring that it's going to fit and that the viewers will react positively.
They will receive much love from the beginning, because people are proud of him and of what he has done.
"How can you not support him?" said Katz.
But that'll only last a few weeks.
To go further, you have to dance.
Skarlatos, who's bullac and wants to become a cop, says he's been having fun in this completely unknown environment so far.
The programme represented the worst fight, since it was often necessary to travel to Los Angeles between the moments when it was announced in the media and the various prizes.
He said that at the end of August, when he returned to the United States immediately after the train accident, he just wanted to relax with his family.
"That lasted about a day and a half," he said.
Totally, I stayed home for four days.
There is a risk of catching a person who draws the average attention, but it is not common to be in the light of the reflectors, said executive producer Wade.
And the show wants to ensure that the competitor prospers and is fun.
"The pressure is great and we want participants to have a pleasant experience," said Wade.
"I don't want Alek to ever say, "Aleu, what did I do?"
Let's keep the pumps out of it.
McRib of McDonald's coming back.
The time has come for those who wait all year for the pig meat sandwich in the form of mini-costs to enjoy.
But what's harder to find this year?
The CNBC reports that only 55% of McDonald's French from the country offers this special season.
Last year, 75% of restaurants served McRib Sandviš.
"The 2015 McRib promotion is about 8,000 restaurants," said McDonald's spokesman Lisa McComb, for The Times in an e-mail.
There are fewer than 14 300 restaurants in the USA of this fast-food.
However, according to McCob, individual owners of the French decide whether to serve or not McRib.
"Participation is not significantly different than last year," says McComb.
Owners/operators are free to offer the menu they think their local customers want.
And if you're still wondering what a McRib is, McDonald's tried to explain the ingredients last year, with a video clip to show the reality.
According to the video clip, McRib sandwich is prepared from pig meat, water, dextrose and conservants.
The sandwich will be available until the end of the year, at McDonald's restaurants participating.
There is also a website with places where McRib (naffiliated at McDonald's), which can be useful.
People can report on the website if they discover restaurants with McRib and can search the nearest place to use this sandwich.
However, a quick search on the site shows that the nearest restaurant with McRib from Los Angeles is located in Sebastopol in Sonoma County, discovered last week by Aidan Briggsonian.
Sometimes I just can't fight BBQ pizza.
Keith Richards explains that he'd prepare new Rolling Stones records.
Keith Richards is again in the light of the reflections with a new solo album and an appearance in a documentary, but soon, and the other members of the Rolling Stones team could join them in the studio.
Richards announced that he and the others from Stones - Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood - met recently in London and made "clear registration plans", as he says.
Last night, Richards spoke in the ICONS series from iHeartRadio with reporter Jim Kerr.
A possible new album from Stones would be the first LP of the team after "A Bigger Bang" in 2005.
But the body wasn't quite inactive.
In recent years they have had many tournaments on stadiums and have sang in more small concerts in L.A., while representatives at Echoplex and the Funda Theatre.
Finally, they re-interpreted the classic LP in 1971, "Sticky Fingers".
In particular, Richards was employed this year in collaboration with the document “Keith Richards: Under the Influence”, scheduled to be launched on September 18th.
This year, he released only the "Crosseyed Heart" album of his third only career for five decades.
Randy Lewis of The Times described Richards' new album in an earlier interview with the guitarist: "Always the voice of Richards is a more loving instrument than different."
But Richards is exhilarating emotion in all the 15 tunes of the album and this has always meant, in fact, rock 'n' roll.
In the interview, Richards says the team will probably enter the studio after the South American tournament from the beginning of next year.
He did not give any further details, but, judging after the final concert, the body is still very full of life.
Toronto Film Festival: Jason Bateman about childhood, maturity and "The Family Fang"
Jason Bateman has already passed through some difficult transitions in his career, with a discreet drug that made them look much easier than they were actually.
Sometimes an actor in television broadcasts such as "Silver Spoons", as an adult has been reaffirmed in the role of an unexpressive typical in the television series "Crescent Situation" and in movies such as "Cosmar Heads".
The first film he worked as a director was a very accident "Bad Words", in which he also played.
The film was nominated at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2013.
Bateman returned to Toronto this week with "The Family Fang", the second film he filmed, an ambitious film from the point of view, the adaptation of Kevin Wilson's 2011 popular novel. The scenario is written by David Lindsay-Abaire, winner of the Pulitzer Prize, and in the film he plays Nicole Kidman and Bateman, in the role of the brothers with problems.
The film is a festival that seeks American distribution.
Many paper reviews considered it a comedy with strong emotional tendons; the film reinterprets the story, placing more emphasis on its dramatic side, more darker.
In an interview with our publication on Tuesday, Bateman says he has always considered the book more a drama than a comedy.
"I've never seen such a book," he confessed.
In books, subjects and themes are very dramatic and very human.
I thought Kevin was addressing a very sensitive subject in a very funny way.
So that was always the order I saw things, a drama with moments of frivolity and comedy and eccentricity.
The World Cup of Monday night benefited from an introduction by the director of the festival's program, Kerri Craddock, who expressed his enthusiasm especially towards the "The Hogan Family" seat from the late '80s and early '90s, where Bateman worked. "I didn't meet too many "Hogan Family" fans," said Bateman dry when he ran on stage.
However, the few episodes he had in his seat brought Bateman, now 46 years old, to Directors Guild at the age of 18.
The story of his new film has a family named Fang in the center.
Parents, Caleb and Camille (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett), are artists with a medium reputation, best known for the way they use their children, Annie and Baxter, in their performances, for example by putting on the way a bank jaff with cards or playing the role of very weak street musicians.
At maturity, Annie (Kidman) and Baxter (Bateman) are trying to find their own identity.
Annie is attracted to a hunger strike, although she is much worse for public scandals than for performance, and Baxter is a romantic journalist and magazine journalist who tries to reach fame.
When Caleb and Camille disappeared in mysterious horrors, Annie and Baxter deny that it is just another trick of theirs and try to discover the truth about their parents and find new truths about themselves.
I don't think it's hard to see what the stories of the actors who want to evolve into adult life have reflected directly and deeply in Bateman.
"My childhood was a very typical one," says Bateman.
I started acting when I was 10 years old, with my parents as manager, and this movie has many elements that go over the way I grew up.
So I couldn't see the story right for a superficial and fun.
"It's a story I feel about and I understand it deeply," he added, "and, although I didn't try to add my personal experience to it, I knew very clearly how to show this film to represent children with a non-traditional childhood."
The project started with Kidman, and she's the film producer, who got the rights for Wilson's book.
After Wilson refused to write his own adaptation, he was captured Lindsay-A Aire, who adapted his own play "Treaty to reality", in which he played Kidman.
Bateman argues that he accepted the chance to govern the film and play in it.
(Kidman, currently on stage in London in the production of “Photograph 51”, did not participate in the month prize.
The driver of the paper was found in public.)
In Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called Bateman's film "a smart and caustic adaptation" which "gives to the clichés of the very disabled family and decomposes the mission, sometimes of life, of children to understand their parents in ways that can be fun and sweet-hearted, incisive and often very dark."
In Variety, Justin Chang called the film "a very sharp portrait" and said that Bateman "shows visible progress and greater maturity as film director with this structured intelligent adaptation, but never too narrow or mechanical".
After the month's project, when Bateman and Walken were on stage for the question session, the audience occupied him with the Walken massacre.
Regarding Bateman as a director and actor, Walken said during the question session that "I was impressed every day.
I didn't come to believe the ease with which the film director works between them, which is very difficult, and the actor in the scene.
His concentration is really amazing.
In a certain dialogue scene, Bateman is sitting on a ladder in the family's house behind the room, hiding in bed, just a corner of the profile, while Kidman is closer to the room and sees himself more clearly.
It's not hard to imagine Bateman's actor discussing with Bateman's director about the fact that he can't be seen.
"I think it's amazing that I'm interested in filming," said Bateman.
All my decisions come from this, I never take them to make me an actor.
To be responsible for creating all the experience for the public, not just one instrument in that orchestra, to be an actor, is a complete thing.
Without saying that that... actor wants a primary plan.
During the question and answer session, Bateman testified that, after reading the scenario, he immediately thought of the Walken for Caleb's role, but also the composer Carter Burwell for the sound column.
Known primarily for the extended friendship with the Coen brothers, Burwell composed the sound column for two other films present at the Toronto Festival: Anomalis's animation film "Anomalis" - a story about the love and isolation of Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson - and "Legenda Gangsters", explains Brian Helgeland about the English gangs of the 1960s, Ronnie and Reggie Kray.
Burwell composed the sound column and for the "Carol" film of Todd Haynes.
"I find it very interesting to see the works with extended or acquired tones," says Bateman, giving more explanations Tuesday.
Navigate through those tones and guide the harmonious audience and something elegant from one to the next, through the film.
Carter built an incredible career and reputation as a person who can navigate through the most complex tunnels.
With “The Family Fang”, Bateman made yet another step of surprise, both as director and as an actor, in a career dominated by adventure and decision, a mixture of comedy and drama, light and dark.
After Bateman finished his film introduction to the World Moon Award, "Good, bad, came out exactly as I wanted."
The festival is looking like Oscaruri on Boston Globe research on pedophile priests
Did you win $240,000 on the ball?
A ticket to X-LOTTO worth more than $240,000 is unclaimed for a month.
The unregistered ticket at the X-Lotto extraction was purchased from the Ingle Farm Shopping Centre on Montague Rd, Saturday, August 15.
Along with the winning ticket sold in South Australia, 16 other winning revenues have been recorded throughout Australia, which have shared the estimated X-Lotto prize fund of $4 million.
SA Lotteries invites all those who bought tickets to X-Lotto from England Farm Lotteries Kiosk to check them out as soon as possible.
The winning numbers from the extraction of X-Lotto 3555 Saturday, August 15, are 36, 23, 12, 6, 28 and 26.
The additional numbers are 43 and 27.
Katt Venables, manager Ingle Farm Lotteries Kiosk, says he is eagerly waiting to receive the good news that the one who won the grand prize and checked the ticket at X-Lotto.
"We have tried to spread the news, because a person is our winner and has no empty idea," she said.
The detectives from the crime scene the house on the way to Beadell, Burton, where the last time Daniel Hind disappeared
Hind's sister, Chelsea Hind, said it's frustrating to wait for information about her brother missing, especially because the police offered two different versions of his course the night he was last seen.
Her family asked the police to search the place from the disappearance of her brother.
"I was hoping they'd find the house, I wasn't told they'd do it," she said.
Mrs. Hindi says that her family also wants those who knew what happened to her brother to speak and tell the truth to the police.
"We just want to find out where Daniel is and what he did that night," she said.
We are four children and we have many other family members and half of us believe he's alive somewhere, and the other half think he's not.
Anyway, we don't want him home and finish the story.
By 2022, Bulgaria will add 635 kilometres of road
By 2022, the Bulgarian government plans to build 635 kilometres of new roads and repair 17 000 kilometres of main and secondary roads.
The finalisation of the works for the Hemus, Struma, Maritsa, Cherno More and Kalotina road transport, all being part of the pan-European road transport corridor, is identified by the priorities of the road infrastructure development plan approved by Wednesday.
The plan aims to create a sustainable rail infrastructure in Bulgaria and to integrate it into the European transport network, but also to ensure enhanced rail safety and efficient management of rail transport, the Government said.
Bulgaria is a transit country for the traffic of cultural goods in Syria
According to Minister of Interior Romania Bahvarova, Bulgaria is a transit country for the illicit traffic of cultural goods stolen from the Middle East due to its geographical expansion.
During a peaceful speech at a conference on the struggle against the Jews of the Syrian cultural heritage, Bahvarova recalled that Bulgaria's national legislation was rejected to conform to the new context, stressing the prohibition of cross-border trade in Syria and Iraq.
Bahvarova, quoted by the Bulgarian Press Agency (BTA), said that the efforts of the competent units of the Ministry of the Interior, in particular the Directorate-General for the "Organised Crime Combating" (GDBOP) focused on preventing the illegal sale and sale of Bulgarian cultural objects.
He stated that Bulgaria is a country with a rich history, where recent studies have placed it on the third place, after Italy and Greece, in the field of traffic of objects and cultural goods.
Bulgaria's Ministry of Interior further demonstrated that the trafficking of cultural objects and the destruction of historical sites in areas such as Iraq and Syria is a phenomenon that has taken over, describing a crime of extreme gravity.
He stressed the need for concerted and decisive measures to stop the intended destruction of history.
Director-General of UNESCO, Irina Bokova, said that Syria's illegal archaeological findings show that the country is affected by the industrial collapse.
The participants at the Wednesday conference recognized that Syria's cultural heritage is seriously threatened and that the international community must unite to stop the illegal traffic of cultural goods in the war-threatening country.
Rockedyne aircraft says the program for the new AR-1 engine could be modified.
Tuesday, Aerojet Rocketyne Holdings Inc said it is expected to finalise a new AR-1 rocket engine by 2019 to replace a Russian engine that will be banned soon, but the date could be changed if it does not receive enough funds from the US government.
Vice-President Aerojet, Julie Van Kleeck, refused to give statements on the fact that Aerojet offered $2 billion to buy the United Launch Alliance (ULA), a mixed company with equal actions for rocket launch by Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.
Analysts say that the proposed amount is a strategic move of Aerojet to cross the Blue Origin River, a company owned by the founder Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos, who develops a new engine ULA wants to use for his new Vulcan rocket.
The ULA says that the Blue Origin engine program is about two years before the AR-1 engine from Aerojet, a statement that Aerojet contradicts it.
The new engines became priority after the US legislators adopted a ban on the use of Russian RD-180 engines for the launch of military or spying satellites, following the accession of Ukraine's Crime Region by Russia last year.
Van Kleeck says that Aerojet tests hardware equipment for the engine, which is designed with three-dimensional printed parts to fit both atlas 5 and ULA rocket, now fed by the RD-180 engine, and in the new Vulcan rocket that develops an ULA that costs about $1 billion.
Aerojet says it will be less costly and less risky to integrate the engine into Atlas 5 instead of developing a new engine and a complete rocket, as it is currently considering ULA.
Van Kleeck says that Aerojet planned to start the engine test on a broad scale in 2017, followed by the receipt of the certificate in 2019, but the date could be extended if the company does not receive enough funds from the Air Force in contracts expected at the end of the first half of the fiscal year 2016, which begins in October.
It further claims that the entire company was impatient to see how the Air Force would share a funding of approximately $160 million between rival competitors.
He also says that Aerojet was planning to try other private financing options for the engine, but did not provide details.
Competition from the Air Forces is a public-private partnership and each of the bidders must provide a third of the funding, and Air Forces cover two thirds.
Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, and Blue Origin, both of which are private companies, have self-financed the engine creation process and they say they are not looking for the government's inevitable funding.
Bever company AB InBev intends a merger worth $275 billion with SABMiller
Heeuuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the world's largest beer producer company, approached the rival company SABMiller (SAB.L) for a take-off that would produce a third of the world's total beer.
Such a merger would have a market value of approximately USD 275 billion at current prices and would combine the ruling AB InBev' in Latin America with SABMiller in Africa, both representing markets with rapid development, but also their beer factories in Asia.
"The real attraction is Africa, where AB InBev is not present, but some places in Asia and Latin America," analyst Andrew Holland from the General Society said.
AB InBev and other top beer-producing companies are trying to enter the new market and strengthen the weak points in North America and Europe, where consumers prefer the beer produced by independent players or wine or spirit drinks.
SABMiller, a company located on two world markets and the producer of more than 200 beer brands, during which Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell stated Wednesday that it was informed of AB InBev's intention to make an offer, which should take place by 14 October at the latest, in accordance with British law.
AB InBev, controlled by 3G Capital, a private capital fund administered by a group of Brazilian investors, confirmed the approach.
3G, named for its policy to reduce marketing costs, orchestrated the previous purchase of Burger King, Heinz ketchup producer (KHC.O.) and Kraft Foods.
A close source of SAB said it's too early to say what to do, because they didn't get any offer.
"At this moment, we are in the stage waiting and deciding," said the source.
Speculations on a merger, which would likely be causing great anxiety about the infringement of competition rules on markets such as the United States and China, have been around for years.
The moment of the approach, after a better decade of purchases carried out by AB InBev, follows a drop of approximately 15% of the SABMiller shares price starting in August.
"It's exactly the moment you expected," said analyst Phil Gorham from Morningstar.
From a financial point of view, for the first time in many years, it is logical.
AB InBev will have to pay at least 40 loans (62 USD) for SAB Miller, perhaps 45 loans, according to analysts, which would mean a total price of up to $130 billion, which would include SABMiller debt.
This would make the most significant transaction M&A of 2015, which is already a record year after the financial crisis in 2008 from the point of view of the transaction's amount, and one of the biggest purchases in 1980 is growing.
SAB's shares were close to 19.9% to 36.14 litres, with a gross capitalization of $90 billion.
AB InBev shares reached 6.4%.
Heineken rivals (HEIN.AS), Carlsberg (CARLb.CO) and Diageo (DGE.L) assume that SAB could seek another merger as a defence strategy, as happened last year when Heineken was offered to buy, but failed.
Since then, it has combined the African bottler with the Coca-Cola (KO.N.), and in recent weeks there has been a pool of a combination with Diageo or an Australian Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL.AX).
The global market share of AB InBev, Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, was 21.1% in 2014, while SABMiller was 15%, according to experts in the Plato Logic industry.
AB InBev intends a report between the net debt and the gross profit (EBITDA) 2 times, from the 2.5 present value.
It is possible to achieve the goal in 2016, the most realistic date on which the transaction could be concluded, so it would be possible to borrow to finance a purchase.
When he bought Budweiser's producer company, Héeuuser-Busch, in 2008 with 52 billion dollars, the biggest purchase of ice money in history at that time. he let the report grow more than 5 times.
A huge auction would allow him to accumulate a debt of 100 billion dollars.
The families that control AB InBev have a little more than half of the company, while the two main shareholders of SABMiller are the producer of Altria (MO.N) and Santo Domingo family in Colombia.
Wednesday, Others refused to make statements about AB InBev's approach, but, on 9 September, its financial director, Billy Gifford, said during an analysis conference that the investment in SABMiller is being evaluated regularly and that "from this time we consider that the holding of assets is in the interest of our shareholders".
The Santo Domingo family could not be contacted immediately for the declarations.
Neil Dwane, head of European investment, equity, to Allianz Global Investors, which holds shares in both companies, says AB InBev has faced a growing pressure to return the surplus to shareholders.
ABI pays a very high price, but the accumulation of income from small debt reaches somewhere about 15%.
But we believe that the profit obtained from this purchase would be a percentage of disappointment, 8%, after 10 years," Dwana said.
In any combination, there are significant difficulties related to the infringement of competition rules, particularly in the United States, where companies have about 70% of the beer market.
"Economics that could be done in distribution operations are great, and the paths involved in violating competition rules are even greater," said Erik Gordon, professor at the Ross Business School at Michigan University.
Such a transaction would allow Molson Cores to obtain 58 per cent of SABMiller's company's shareholdings, in accordance with the operation agreement that governs it.
A change of control to SABMiller would automatically grant Molson the right to get another 8% and to appoint a new executive director of the company.
Molson, with the denver seat, would have the right to the first and last offer for the rest of 50 percent.
A Molson spokesman refused to comment if the company is interested in a bid, but Molson’s actions have increased by over 12 percent, to their highest value.
Any merger could also have to sell shares in China, where market leader is the CR Snow association with SABMiller with China Resources (0291.HK).
Heineken, Carlsberg or Tsingtao from China could be potential buyers.
Plato estimates that the combined group could have a 28% share of the global market after the crackdown.
AB InBev is advised by Lazard, and SABMiller is advised by Robey Warshaw, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.
Pakistani police accused an former Air Force pilot of assisting Qaeda
The Pakistani police arrested an former Air Force pilot who would have been given further funds to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, in a rare case by police officers for Reuters.
The suspect, Syed Sheaba Ahmed, was detained in the southern city of Karachi.
This paid for the treatment of wounded Taliban soldiers at a hospital in the eastern city of Lahore, the police said.
He also influenced two soldiers involved a month later in an attack on a bus with members of the Muslim and Islamic minority, after which 45 people died, told the senior police officer Naveed Khawaja of the Department for the Combating of Terrorism in the province.
This will be accused of financing terrorism, Khawaja said.
"Ahamed has already funded the Afghans, we are still doing research to see if he has provided financial assistance through his business or behind him," said the officer.
"So also, Ahmed has provided more financial assistance for AQIS," he said, referring to Al Qaeda organisation on the Indian Subcontinent, an Al Qaeda framework founded a year ago.
This arrest is a rare success for Pakistani police forces, which is faced with activism, corruption and crime.
After, in December, the Taliban were massacred by about 150 people, mostly children, at a military school, the government swore to suppress the activity.
There were severe attacks, as the army also advanced, and more in tribal regions outside the law border with Afghanistan.
However, the militarized groups remain a threat and many have adopted from Pakistani cities under the control of very weak police forces and with insufficient funds.
Ahmed, at 52 years of age, used to preach in a mosque in the good area of the Karachi Army Residents' Authority.
His public lectures were moderate, but, in particular, encouraged radicalism, the police said.
He studied at the Pakistani Air Force College in Sargotha and left the Pakistanese Air Force in 1998, declared another security officer for Reuters under anonymated.
He later entered the wood industry and chemicals.
Rapper Rick Ross rejected the author's claim for "Everyday I'm Hustlin"
The neworque rapper Rick Ross can't claim copyright for the words "Everyday I'm hustlin'", a U.S. judge, reiterating his complaint against the LMFAO musical group, who sold tricks with a similar verse, "Everyday I'm shufflelin'".
In a decision published on March of the Miami federal court, district judge Kathleen Williams said that Ross's slogan, part of his initial hit in 2006, "Hustlin'", is a short statement that the courts have mentioned several times that they cannot obtain copyrights.
Williams' judicial decision weakens the process of violating the copyright that Ross, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II, tried against LMFAO in 2013.
Ross claimed that the two electropops of Los Angeles, quoted by Stefan Gordy and Skyler Gordy, copied "Hustlin'" for their own famous music in 2010, "Party Rock Anthem", which contains the verse "Everyday I'm shufflelin".
The old hip hop said that the LMFAO melodia is "a clear attempt to capitalise the fame and success of the Hustlin melody".
He also gave Kia Motors in court for the use of the "Party Rock Anthem" melody in a advertising campaign.
In his complaint, Ross claimed that LMFAO violated his copyright, selling tricks and other products with the shufflin logo.
In the March judgment, Williams says "Hustlin" as a melody is protected by copyright law.
But Ross's three-word slogan is derived from ordinary words and cannot have copyrights, she said.
The judge compared him with other famous verses in the music of the past, such as "you got the right one, uh-huh", "hella back" and "we get it poppin'", saying it is "a short expression which all courts have declared it in unanimity impossible to put under copyright".
The judge did not decide whether the LMFAO team's melody is an unauthorized copy of Hustlin'.
The process is scheduled for October.
Ross's lawyers and LMFAO could not be contacted immediately for the declarations.
The case is William L. Roberts, II et al. Stefan Kendal Gordy et al, to the U.S. District Court for Southern District, Florida, No.

Dr. Carson approaches Trump in the most recent presidential Sunday of the Republican Party
According to the most recent presidential poll for 2016, the newsman Ben Carson approached Bombastic leader Donald Trump in the pre-republic elections.
Carson got 17 points last month, while Jeb Bush dropped in seven polls.
Following Trup's 27% support in the latest CBS/New York Times, Carson, retired neurosurgery, comes to the second place by 23 percent, followed by Bush, by Mike Huckabee TV, from Florida Senator Marco Rubio, each with 6%.
Support from the Republican voters in the preliminary elections grew from the beginning of August to the beginning of September for Trump, Carson, governor of Ohio John Kasich and former executive director of Hewlett Packard, Carly Fiorina.
The support for the last two remains, however, in numbers of the same number.
Jeb Bush, who was governor of Florida and who goes further away from the Bush family standards, fell seven percentage points in a month, while Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker dropped eight points.
Last Sunday, Walker's support is 2%.
Carson received greater support than Trump among college graduates (29% versus 21%), while Trump is before Carson in the preferences of the non-university voters (30% versus 19%).
Trump is supported by more men than women, while women prefer Rubio more than men.
37% of Sunday's respondents said they were decided to support the preliminary elections in their state.
Those who said I know who will vote with him twice more on Trump than Carson.
It is still too early to say for 63% of the Republican voters for the preliminary elections.
The results of the CBS/NYT Sunday held between 9 and 13 September will be made public Tuesday, before a Republican presidential debate.
Carson's seat on this Sunday reflects Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders in front of the leader for the nomination of democracies to the president, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
The latest follow-up to the CBS presidential nominations shows that Sanders has moved with 10 points and 22 points in Iowa, respectively in New Hampshire, among the democratic voters for the preliminary.
An ethical renowned specialist says sexual theft should be banned
A ethics specialist in the robotic industry launched a campaign asking for the ban on the development of sexual robots.
Dr. Kathleen Richardson, an expert in robotics at the University of De Montfort of Leicester, England, warns that sexual theft could contribute to the systematic dehumanization of women and children.
"Sex robots seem to represent an increasingly important subject in the robotic industry, and the models that are inspired - the way they will show, what roles they will have - are very exciting," she said to the BBC.
Richardson explains that her campaign against sexual thieves is not against sex, but against exploitation.
Technology is not neutral.
He's inspired by class, race and gender.
Political power inspires technology development," she said for Washington Post.
That's why we can do something about it.
These robots will contribute to increasing sexual exploitation.
Although sexual thefts that are now being produced are still relatively primitive, Richardson is concerned that this represents the first step towards something more sinister.
It's a new and emerging technology, but we have to cut it off.
I'm sure the industry seems to be on the alert.
A few years ago, the company produced a genuine company of gonflable poppies launched Roxxxy, "the first sexual robot in the world".
However, concern about the potential risks posed by artificial intelligence is not unusual, even among large industrial representatives.
Even this spring, the executive director of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk, wrote about “the risk that, in five years, something really dangerous will happen.
In an interview with BBC last December, physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking warned that "the development of a complete artificial intelligence could mean the end of the human race".
Great Britain hits the first refugees from Syria - RT UK
In the next days, Great Britain will receive the first refugees who have fled from the Syrian war, Minister of Interior Theresa May announced.
These will receive assistance within the comprehensive government reinstallation programme.
Refugees seeking asylum from camps on the border with the war-end country.
These are the first of the 20,000 refugees the United Kingdom plans to receive by 2020.
In a speech in the House of Commons, the Minister of the Interior stated that the government "works fast" to ensure more succession.
In the United Kingdom's accession process, it is imperative that the assistance and support they need and deserve are already put in place.
I know that members and the general public want to find out more about the number of people and the date on which their arrival is estimated.
May said that the government must make more plans to ensure that refugees have adequate provisions when they arrive.
I must stress that the level of enlargement needs careful and methological planning to ensure that everything is done properly.
Me and the Syrian refugee minister, Richard Harrington, will continue to be in the House in this regard.
But I am happy to tell the House that we are waiting for the first refugee wave in the coming days and we are working fast for planning more events in the weeks to come.
Prime Minister David Cameron drew the anger of parliamentarians and militarists when he revealed the plan for government refugees, many thinking that the number was too small.
In September, Cameroon declared in the House of Commons that the United Kingdom "will rise to the height of its moral responsibility" and will receive 20,000 refugees from the camps in the Middle East to the next general elections.
He added that refugees will not receive complete asylum automatically, but a humanitarian status that will allow them to apply for asylum after five years.
But critics observed that the figures meant only 12 refugees a day, and former liberal parliamentary democratic Paddy Ashdown said the measures are "distant".
Furthermore, Ashdown revealed that children included in this scheme would be deported when they were 18 years old if they did not receive asylum.
Also, you see and important public personalities have condemned, on their part, the measures.
In a joint letter, large names such as Benedict Cumberbach, Colin Firth, Jamie Oliver and Keira Knightley said that the response to the crisis is "too little, too late".
"It is a responsibility that must be shared with our European neighbors, not just thrown on the shoulders of the surrounding countries by the conflicts that plague people in their homes," she wrote.
Rubla refers to the global uncertainty fund - RT Business
The Russian ruble has been strengthened by Wednesday, being negotiated with the US dollar 65.66 and with the EUR 73.98 at Moscow Bursa at 10:00 GMT.
In general, the Russian currency won seven percent of its lowest rate of 71 rubles for a dollar, on August 24.
Analysts say that the return of the ruble was due to investors' reaction to current global market disturbances caused by China's difficulties, the possible increase in the United States Federal Reserve profit rate and the excessive reaction to oil oil.
Brent's cost increased by 61 cents, reaching $48.36 per barrel.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded 72 cents more, to USD 45.31 per barrel.
ALSO IN THIS ISSUE: The most likely, the profit rate will grow in the US by the end of 2015 - US Fed
"It is possible to say the word, fueled by uncertainty about China and at the time of the increase in federal prosperity rate, which will continue to give a tone for oil prices and for rubella," said Bloomberg Piotr Matys from Rabobank, an expert in foreign monetary policy strategies, established in London.
Experts also indicate another factor that explains the strengthening of the Russian currency.
The Russian oil company chiefs Lukoil and Rosneft, whose contracts are related to the US dollar, began buying rubles.
The global markets are expected with the spirit to win the Federal Reserve decision on Thursday, if it will increase or not increase the profit rate.
Markets consider that what might not be the first growth in the nine years of US prosperity rate will not happen and have been traded at higher rates of prosperity.
Nasa and the United Kingdom work together in the drone traffic system
NASA already works with US government and companies such as Google, Amazon and Verizon telephone company to develop a database that allows drone pilots to reserve air space blocks for flights.
Nothing has yet been established at EU level.
Cooperation is a result of a very widespread lack of cooperation regarding the possibility of air pollution between small drones and commercial aircraft.
A new Forrester report describes in the colors the potential negative effect.
"Imagine thousands of drones operated by hundreds of companies delivering products or collecting data in urban areas with high density, such as New York City, Chicago or San Francisco," the research says.
Without a common set of technological protocols and air rules, the haosol could be installed.
According to Déta O'Cathain, Baroness of the Lorzil Room, concern has been amplified on the basis of the reports on events in the production limit of an accident and the operation of drones over football stadiums, near nuclear power stations and the Eiffel Tower.
"In the past two years, more than 400 calls to the metropolitan police have been linked to drone incidents," said O'Cathain.
The solution is to build a system that follows all drones, especially those flying at a height of less than 150 metres, whether they are driven by commercial or amateur pilots.
"As many small drones carry out commercial flights at joas height, beyond the visibility level of the pilot, or even completely autonomous flights, an infrastructure of air traffic management is needed to separate flights with a view to ensuring the safety of complex operations, such as the delivery of collections in the city," she said.
According to Nasa, this drone traffic management system will include services such as the design of the air space, methods to avoid adverse weather conditions and wind, the management of congestions, the planning of the track and direction by similar means to the rules laid down for road traffic, such as signalling and gas.
This is expected to have a functional prototype by 2019.
The drone industry is exploding in the European Union in the coming years.
"We already see small and innovative SMEs in the UK using this technology with significant effects in the energy, agriculture and media industries," says Lord Tariq.
Over 670 permits for commercial drone operations were granted only in the United Kingdom by the Civil Aviation Authority in 2014.
The European Commission estimates that the drone industry could generate 150 000 jobs in the EU by 2050.
The Dislike button: why Facebook wants to know what's bothering you
A Look Back works similarly, adding the most important moments (on Facebook).
But what will this mean for many users within the virtual borders of Facebook, which are now more than the population of any country?
First of all, of course, a button of empathy will allow Facebook to understand you better.
The vast value of Facebook - approximately 240 billion USD after the latest statistics - is due to the amount of unimaginated data on consumers it holds.
Each interaction, posting, appreciation and friendship you make are gathered and build a remarkable picture of the complex, found in a permanent update, about your person and about the preferences you have.
This is valuable primarily for advertising agencies, who can use all this information to choose carefully what people will see their ads on Facebook by selecting those who are most interested in their products.
An empathy button adds another set of data and, certainly, opens a door for another type of advertising agents to use the platform.
While a sports company is looking for people who "appreciate" a national football team, charitable organisations and promoters want to address those who, for example, "employ" with the refugee crisis.
It will also probably change what you see in the News.
Facebook uses incredible and sophisticated algorithms to restrict that huge universe of content that you could see, in the smaller flow that you actually see.
This algorithm depends essentially on what you considered interesting in the past and especially what you liked.
Without a doubt, there is on Facebook the theme that many interesting posts, but unfortunately they don't enter the algorithm, because people don't feel they should appreciate them.
However, if Facebook understands more about what angers you or makes you feel unhappy, it may decide to remove this kind of post from the News.
Facebook has launched past experiments to understand how what you see in the News affects you emotionally and, especially, how this is transmitted from one person to another.
The representatives of the academic environment call this "emotional contamination" and, although it sounds ridiculous, it is likely only a simple Facebook attempt (and published open, with their agreement) to better understand the way their platform works and if you can adjust the algorithms to distribute more elements.
What's going to happen with the empathy button remains on Facebook.
The really shocking thing is how a single company's decision to add a single button to its services can produce such speculation.
The reason for this may be the fact that the decisions made by Facebook - whether it involves the visible buttons we see or the invisible algorithms that work together - today have profound consequences for us.
Now we spend a significant part of our life in the digital world, which we access to find anything from love to comfort or a new job.
On the other hand, Facebook is a company and another that leads to a constant struggle for survival in the Darwinian world of green technology and social networks.
The decisions taken, including for new buttons, will be considered the most appropriate to remain on the surface in this course.
I think many people can feel this and soon they'll have a button for this.
Biometric disorders can prevent crises in people with autism
During the ten years of research in America, Dr. Goodwin and his team have found that the body's signals can prevent these changes, sometimes violent, before they occur, thus giving the assistants the opportunity to take appropriate measures.
The kids with autism we're working with can't tell us what's going on.
I can't say he's hurting his head or that "he's too mad here" or "I don't like this teacher".
If we want to understand them, we need to see what their body is conveying to us, and we need to do this in a pale and non-intrusive way.
For example, simple viewing of colors in an application can show the level of agitation. The pink can be used to warn about a change of behavior, and the white for lack of interest, by understanding the assistant that the person is tired and needs encouragement.
The data can be collected in time and saved on a secure server, helping caregivers to understand the overall picture of how the person responds to various situations and which would be the most appropriate intervention.
I have to say very clearly that we don't read the mind.
Biometric sensors are not magic, they need a man to be interpreted.
He added that his team will work with producers to further develop this technology to be specific for autism.
The research was appreciated by Jane Carolan, Director of Services for Customers from the Wirral Autistic Society, who will present technology at the Autech 2015 Autism and Technology Conference in Manchester on October 1.
When you work with people who suffer from serious autism, as we do, you see the spectacular difference that can bring it to their quality of life the technology of assistance. Now, the applications for iPad give, in fact, a voice to people who have never spoken.
The robots help the car kids learn to play because you've got your cover.
"Who knows where this innovation might lead us," she says.
Assistive technologies can really change life and feel that they are part of our mission, as a charitable organisation for autism, to ensure that we all have access to this information and are also part of the debate on the way we want to support people with autism in the future.
France will attack Isis in Syria "in the coming weeks"
In the following weeks, French warplanes will launch air raids on Isis tribes in Syria, the government announced Wednesdays, just a few days after President François Hollande said the intervention was a "need".
France will launch the first air raids on the group Jihadist Islamic State in Syria "in the following weeks," Minister of Defence Jean-Yves Le Drian said Wednesday.
The French Air Force is leaving recognition missions in Syria on 8 September, and the attacks will follow "in the following weeks, as we will have clearly identified", Le Drian said for France Inter radio station.
Le Drian said in parliament Tuesday that the Islamic state has made "very significant progress" in Syria, especially in the northern region of Aleppo.
"The sea has an extremely offensive place of power, and if it succeeds, it could destroy what we still call the Free Syrian Army or the Syrian National Coalition or what remains of it," he said.
France is part of a U.S.-led coalition that bombes Isis' positions in Iraq for a year, but the Netherlands has changed the strategy last week to extend actions in Syria, under conditions where political pressure is combined on the Jewish threat fund facing France.
The United States of America, Canada, Turkey and the Gulf States have already been involved in attacks on Isis soldiers in Syria.
The blocking feature of iOS 9 ads will make your phone faster
The newest version of iOS 9 is released Wednesdays and contains many new features.
One of the most useful for iPhone owners - and concern for online editors - is the ability to easily block ads during web browsing.
The new function will allow users to download the third extension blocking cookies, ads, pop-up windows and other types of advertising while using the version for the Safari mobile browser from Apple.
In the test, it has been shown that, after blocking ads, news sites such as New York Times are loaded twice more quickly, according to Reuters.
In addition, blocking advertising helps users to preserve the use of data and battery autonomy.
Users will benefit from more advertising blocking options, including 1Blocker, Blockr and Crystal applications.
AdBlock Plus, a popular desktop advertising blocker, launched its own iOS web browser that restricts advertising; its creator intends to launch an extension for Safari in the future.
People who use advertising software blockage software face a number of constraints.
The ads are still displayed in applications (from here Apple earns money on iOS).
More media sites, including Hulu and The Washington Post, are trying to prevent visitors from using such advertising blocking features.
However, their use on desktop computers increased by nearly 48% in the previous year.
The development of these huge online media challenges, which are largely offered free of charge to consumers and is supported by advertising for many years.
One report says that blocking ads could cost online editors about 22 billion in the coming from advertising this year alone.
To enable blocking of ads in iOS 9, users need to download an application for blocking ads, then access Settings -> Safari -> Content Blockers to enable an extension to block the content.
Obama talks about terrorism and the crisis of immigrants with the Spanish kings
President Barack Obama met with King Philip VI of Spain in March at the White House, where the two discussed various subjects, but they probably reduced the importance of international cooperation.
Obama and the kings have addressed the subject of the fight against the Islamic State and the increasingly pressing crisis of immigrants in Europe - which has already faced hundreds of thousands of people who have left the country of origin to go west.
"Spain has been trying very hard to face this problem in the past, with North African immigrants who are often involved in very dangerous journeys and traffic," Obama said.
Of course, the problem got worse in the last few months.
Obama also stressed the importance of cooperation, especially in the context of which the Spanish territory of Catalonia will vote in the elections that will take place this month.
"As far as foreign policy is concerned, we have made a firm commitment to maintain relations with a strong and united Spain," Obama said.
The superior commander told King Felipe that he would like to visit the country before the end of his mandate in 2017.
"We'll get your arms open," Philip answered.
First Lady, Michelle Obama, made the queen a tour of the White House and had a tea discussion.
That was the first visit of the royal couple in the United States from the throne.
After they left Washington, they've been making a visit to South Florida.

“Scream Queens” and “Empiry” have the global prize on the same day
Fox provides many positive results before the two of its most expected series: Scream Queens and Empire.
The first season of Queens and the second season of Empire will be broadcast on all Fox International channels one day after the internal prize.
According to Variety, the strategy represents a trend applied to high-profile series, as traffic in global social networks guarantees success.
"Hollywood considers how important it is to value the common voice of sincere international fans, especially for the series on which it speaks very much, such as Empire and Scream Queens," said President Fox International, Hernan Lopez, according to Deadline.
"We're just waiting to broadcast these very interesting series for fans from all over the world," Lopez continued.
The viewers we serve every day bring the success of a series to the prize and throughout his life cycle.
The next season of the Empire, in which you will play famous views such as Mariah Carey and Vivica A. Fox, has the prize in September.
The new Scream Queens series, which will play Emma Roberts and Ariana Grande, will be broadcast the second day in September.
Members of the British royal family will participate in the World Cup of Spectre film
Prince Harry and Dukes and Duke of Cambridge will take part in London's most recent film with James Bond, "Spectre".
The Kensington Palace announced Wednesday news on Twitter, appointing the Royal Film Performance Award for Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund.
According to a press release from the producers, "Spectre" is the third special Bond film in 1946.
In the past, royal premiums have been selected and "Don't Die today" (2002) and Casino Royale (2006).
This year's event takes place on October 26th at Royal Albert Hall in London and will be a cartoon, which will result in benefits for employees from the British film and television industry.
In addition, the film will also be attended by actors, including the main actor Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Naomi Harris, David Bautista, Monica Bellucci and Ralph Fiennes.
Director Sam Mendes and the producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson will go on the red deck with the royal family.
"Spect" will be broadcast in U.S. cinematographs in November.
There are sounds that Christie Brinkley and John Mellencamp would be together
The model Christie Brinkley and the musician John Mellencamp were seen taking dinner together for months, raising the sound that both would have a romantic relationship.
The two met to have dinner at the Bowery Hotel in New York City, where the photos surprised Brinkley with a cheerful and smiling smile.
The 61-year-old supermodel was seen wearing blues, thins and a yellow jacket, while the old rock at 63-year-old was dressed in broken blues, paltons and lemons.
Last year, in October, Mellencamp would have been seen again with his lover who disappears and who is constantly fighting, the actress Meg Ryan.
Mellencamp welcomed the post of the message for you at today's show from the NBC, saying it was "an angel who was sent to me and I'm very happy".
He added that "nothing ends until it ends."
In August, Brinkley's youngest daughter, Sail Brinkley Cook, sat for Seventeen magazine, walking behind her mother.
The kings of the Arctic states are as big as a harpoon
Many studies have shown species that have become more vulnerable because of the climate, but global warming has proved to be a blessing to others.
One of these advanced species is the Arctic landscape.
According to researchers from the Dartmouth College, the hottest temperatures in the Arctic region have allowed farmers here to appear earlier and grow larger, leading to the development of their population.
In a new study, researchers from the John Sloan Dickey Centre for International Understanding from Dartmouth, experts in the Arctic region, and used field observations to illustrate the effects of temperature changes on Arctic landscapes.
Their analysis anticipates a 50% increase in the survival rate of adult states in conditions of a 2 degree increase in Celsius temperature.
The countries are small, but they represent important members of the Arctic tropical and ecosystem chain.
The new analysis - detailed in a new work published in Procedures of the Royal Society B - aims to help biologists predict better how a growing population could affect the species that feed, birds and insects that feed with them and plants that pollinate them.
To build the demonstration, scientists from Dartmouth combined the field results with the results of laboratory experiments that researched how the temperature influences the development of insects and predictive of being mutilated by predators.
Although the increase in temperature makes the bigger countries more vulnerable to the helicopters, it also offers them a temporary start in spring and makes their growth faster and more efficient, which is certainly an advantage.
More countries mean a larger population, which can only be developed to the extent that it can support the feed of insects.
The ability of countries to transform their improved survival rate into an improved reproduction rate depends on their ability to ensure their blood for food.
Antidepressants taken during pregnancy do not affect the child
Three new studies show that the use of antidepressants in pregnant women does not affect the development of their children’s neuronal or behavioural.
Studies have shown that serotonin receptors (SSRIs) are at increased risk of postpartum bleeding, but researchers have stated that depression is a higher risk for women and children, so it should be treated.
"These studies are accompanied by a growing set of evidence on the safety of anti-depressive administration during pregnancy," said a press release by John Thorp, editor-in-chief of the International Journal of Obesttrica and Gynecology, who published all three studies.
However, there are increased risks, so far the evidence shows that the risks of untreated depression are higher than those of anti-depressants.
The Norwegian Institute for Public Health coordinated a study on the development of motor development of children whose mothers were treated with SSRI, analyzing the data of 51,404 children from the Norwegian study on mother and child health, researching the effects of the use of SSRI for the development of motor skills at 3 years of age.
Researchers have found that 381 mothers use SSRI during pregnancy and 159 of them have been treated with medicines for a long period of time.
Although the exposure to SSRI was associated with a measure of delay in engine development, researchers wrote in the study that the association "was not as significant as the delay of a clinical importance".
A group of researchers from the University of Adelaide of Australia launched a data review for 49,000 pregnant women from the Danish National Cohorta to discover the effects of the administration of SSRI on the behaviour of children up to 7 years of age.
The study found that untreated depression in pregnant women was associated with an increased risk of behavioural problems.
Of the 210 children whose mothers were treated with SSRI depression, there was no increased risk of behavioural problems compared to 231 children who were more predisposed to behavioural problems such as hyperactivity, lack of attention and socialization problems.
The same group of Australian researchers also found in a separate study that mothers are more predisposed to bleeding after birth if they are treated with SSRI.
Medical data analysis from 30 198 who were born at a university hospital in Adelaide between 2002 and 2008 showed that the risk of postnatal haemorrhage increased by 5%, between 11 and 16%, if women were treated with SSRI.
The risk of severe haemorrhage or postnatal anaemia has doubled, researchers have reported.
Researchers said that, although the study linked the administration of SSRIs to increased risk, there is a large number of variables - from medicines taken at birth to the limited amount of information from researchers on the specific medical effects of women - which could have had an effect on the potential for bleeding.
"It is possible that women who have taken antidepressants at an advanced stage of work to be those with the most serious disease stage, and this is the reason for the increased risk of postnatal haemorrhages, not antidepressants," says Dr. Luke Grzeskovyak, professor at Adelaide University.
On the basis of this study, we do not recommend that women stop treatment of medicines against depression during pregnancy, but that they be closely monitored to reduce the risk of a potential bleeding.
Matthew is charged with murder in case of murder of students from Virginia Technical University
The man accused of killing students Hannah Graham from Virginia University was charged with murder in case of a student from Virginia Technical University missing in 2009, the authorities announced Tuesday.
The jury of Albemarle, Virginia, brought him to trial for Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr., 33 years old, from Charlottesville, for the murder of Morgan Harrington, the officials say.
Also, Matthew is accused of rape with the intention of rape.
Each head of charge receives the maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
Harrington, aged 20, disappeared from a concert in Charlottesville in 2009, and her body was discovered three months later.
Her parents say the news of the prosecution brought them relief.
"For six years we've been working hard and hard on this," says Gil Harrington, Morgan's mother.
I'm glad to know that, when you take someone's life, you have to bear the consequences for your doing.
For Jesse Matthew, the Dominion of the Consequences began to be buried.
The police say there is a medical relationship between Harrington, Graham and the 2005 Fairfax County cases.
In June, Matthew was found guilty of it later and waits for the sense in this case.
He's staying in Charlottesville jail.
Jesse Matthew accused of murder in case of the death of a student from Virginia University
Harrington attended U-Va. on October 17, 2009, together with his friends, at a Metallic concert.
The group separated when Harrington came out of John Paul Jones Arena from Charlottesville to go to the bathroom and couldn't go back.
Last time he was seen trying to take a taxi around 20:30 in front of the arena.
Harrington was dressed with a black triangle with the Pantera team.
After her disappearance, Harrington's cell phone and phone were found in the arena parking.
Family and friends began searching for Harrington, a graduate of pedagogical studies, who wanted to become a professor. Metallica's friends wrote about her disappearance on their website.
In November 2009, the trick he wore was found near an apartment in Charlottesville.
Then, in January 2010, her body was discovered in an isolated lake, a farm in southwestern Charlottesville.
During Harrington's absence, Matthew worked as a taxi driver in Charlottesville, but it's not clear whether that period ended with the date Harrington disappeared.
The police say a significant advance in the execution of Harrington case was represented by Matthew's arrest in the event of Graham's disappearance last year.
Officials who knew the investigation said these cases were linked to DNA evidence.
The investigators did not make the details of the new evidence that they had decided to put Matthew under trial for Harrington's murder.
The defence lawyer Douglas Ramseur, who represents Matthew in Graham, refused to make statements.
The announcement of the prosecution comes two days after one year after Hannah Graham's disappearance in September.
This case is similar to Harrington's case: both were students who disappeared when they left the city in Charlottesville.
Graham, aged 18, from Fairfax County, was seen traveling with Matthew in a small town near the U-Va campus.
Matthew was arrested for that case a few weeks later, after a national search.
Graham's body was found in October.
In July, Matthew will be tried for a qualified murder in Graham's case.
In the first days after Graham toamna's disappearance in Charlottesville, Gil Harrington represented a constant presentation of the events and privileges organised for the student who disappeared from U-Va.
Harrington says she has given up for her daughter speculations and criticisms in the media that must be reduced to silence of new charges against Matthew.
"All this time, there have been discussions of the kind "Why wear short clothes?" and "And looking for light?" but this kind of question and judge is not valid when it is clear that we have to do it with a walker on the edge of the van," Harrington added.
In the case of Fairfax County, Matthew was sentenced to sexual assault against a youth in 2005.
The woman, who was 26 years old at the time of the attack, told the jury that, one evening in September, while she returned home from the store, a stranger came after her.
He took her to an inverted area, beat her and kicked her in the neck, then attacked her sexual.
"I thought the end had come to me, that I had to step forward," said the woman.
I was afraid I'd die.
Matthew took her ass off the run, said the woman.
A prosecutor told the jury that it is possible that Matthew was afraid of the dangers of a car entering a nearby parking lot.
He was convicted years later, after DNA tests linked him to this case.
Matthew's gonna get his sense in October.
Matthew will come for the first time to the trial in Harrington in Charlottesville Wednesday afternoon.
Dan Harrington, Morgan's father, said that the most likely Wednesdays will come in Charlottesville and visit the place where his daughter was last seen.
"At least today I have taken a step," says Dan Harrington.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel and homologous or Austrian Werner Faymann asked Tuesday, next week, for a European Union summit to resolve the refugee crisis.
At a joint press conference in Berlin, Merkel said that Germany, Austria and Sweden cannot manage the refugee crisis alone.

Charlie Hebdo, new controversial truckers
The French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo provokes new controversy, after publishing cartoons that beat the response of the leading European tariffs to the value of immigrants from predominantly Muslim war-related rivals.
In the latest number of or, the publication has drawn attention again, as well as critics on social networks, writes Reuters agency.
One of the drawings emphasizes a moving picture of Aylan Kurdi, the innocent Syrian pilot, of whose body arrived on one of Turkey's beaches, after an attempt to cross the sea with his family from Syria to Greece.
The drawing from Charlie Hebdo shows a child in short and tricky pants, with the girl down at the bottom of the sea, puts a advertising pan, which offers two menus for children at the price of one single.
"So close to success," is the message that goes into the drawing.
Another drawing, as well as the work of a cartoonist who survived the attack from the Paris editorial headquarters in January, is included in the message "True Europe is a Christian".
The drawing also presents a person of Jesus, who goes to the water, while a person who has a smaller pair of short pants with his feet up in the water, first saying, "Christians go to the water", take the second "Muslim children" away.
The French magazine became a symbol of freedom of expression, after an attack on Islamists in January, as a result of repeated threats after the defeat of the prophet Mohammed.
A lot of supermarkets present in Romania, radically amended in Russia
The French Auchan supermarket land was reduced by over $370,000 of Russian officials, accused of food security fraud.
Anna Popova, head of the Russian Consumer Protection Agency Rospotrebnadzor, said that the threats totalled over 25 million rubles, says $372.000, reports the Associated Press agency, quoted by US News.
The reasons for these threats have not been clarified, and Auchan has not made any comments.
The French milk of supermarkets is also the ink of the Russian agricultural agency's allegations that certain meat products have been deposited as infected with bacteria such as E.coli and Listeria.
Food controls come in a period of tension between France and Russia, on the extension of the European Union’s sanctions and France’s decision to cancel an understanding of the supply of the Russian Mistral ship.
The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs reacted to the situation that Hungary could raise a metal wall at the border with our tank.
MAE appears to have been briefed on this decision and that it is not a proper political gesture.
MAE appears, in a report from Zaire.com, that it was informed by the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about this intention shortly before it was announced.
In the event of an emergency, the MAE shall inform the relevant decision factors of Romania in connection with this situation in good time.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that raising a guard between two Member States of the European Union and which are strategic partners is not a proper political gesture, in accordance with the European spirit.
This position has already been communicated to the consignee, it appears in the communication.
Hungary plans to build a metal guard on a segment of the border with Romania, in the context of the immigration crisis, said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, quoted by Mediafax, said Tuesday.
"The measure is necessary in order for traffickers across Serbia to change their routes, because it is likely to lead to Romania," the head of the Hungarian diplomat explained.
"The guard should start from the border point between Hungary/Serbia/Romania and continue on a reasonable distance if the pressure of migration is moving towards Romania," Szijjarto explained.
At the end of August, it was reported that extra-Community immigrants crossing the Serbian territory to the European Union tried to seize the guard built by the Hungarian authorities through its eastern Cape, at the common border between Serbia, Hungary and Romania.
In this context, extra-Community immigrants have discovered that they can catch the guard through the area of the Majdan/Rade (Serbia) - Beba Veche (Timis, Romania) - Kubekhaza, Hungary.
The Hungarian Government has allocated 22.2 billion forts (€71.8 million) to build a controversial metal fence along the border with Serbia, at a distance of 175 km, and for special centres needing immigrant housing.
The guard initiative is criticised by the European Union and Serbia.
It doesn't need to. It's gonna be there.

The refugees in Romania?
First of the granite localities, questions about the accommodation
The first of the border areas of the Arad Judice are questioned by the Police and the Frontier Police in these days about the accommodations for any refugees who might reach Romania, but also for the yards, where they will be mobilized at the border.
The leader of the city of Nadlac, Vasile Ciceac, said he had discussions on this subject.
The discussions were held including farmers in the area, who were asked to report this to any stranger near the border.
We had discussions with border politicians, national police and local police, but also with farmers in the area.
We all need to be more careful in the next period.
"I asked the farmers, who have worked in this period in the Arab territories, to be careful and report any migration," said the statement.
Immigrant crisis in Hungary: Brilliant and water tunnels on the border
This, like other primers in the border area with Hungary, said the Police asked for information on the accommodation available in the case of a refugee valley.
We've been asked how many people we can hunt.
We don't have shelters for refugees in the community.
We believe that such special centres don't have to appear at the border, because they're harder to control here, migrants are trying to escape, because they're not interested in their shoulder in Romania.
It would be best to establish such centers in areas beyond granite," said the prime minister of Iratosu, Pap Atila Josif.
At the border or, the prime minister of the municipality of Dorobanti, Vincentiu Almasi, said that he was questioned both for the refugees and for the intervention forces, if they were mobilized in the area.
The police were interested if we could rent and yards.
We could find places on the Cultural Road, but for the refugees, we don't have any room to stay.
"I've been asked about the length of the border with Hungary, probably working on an action plan," said Vincentio Almasi.
He added that at the local police station, "from March to March, when Hungary kept its border with Serbia, it was established permanently."
"There is a politician at work all the time, and the locals know that they have to inform if they observe any stranger in the area," the lawyer said.
The representatives of Prime Minister Pilu stated that I can accommodate as many as a hundred people on the Cultural Road, the information being provided to the politicians, at their request.
The mayor of the city of Curtici, Nicolae Aanitei, also said that there were housing spaces in the former local public finances headquarters, where there is a need for threat.
Also, an ex-husband of the Frontier Police could be threatened to expel refugees.
The representatives of the Judah Police Bureau of Arad did not offer a point of view on the issue of primers during this period, confirming that "in the border areas of the Judah Arad, monitoring activities have been intensified".
Commander of the Club of Armada announced radical measures against the Stilei of Becali
Commander of the Sports Club of the Army, Colonel George Boroi, announces a series of radical measurements that will be taken against the stars of Gigi Becali.
Although the two parties have negotiated an impasse, Boroi maintains that the Army will have its own football team, which will take the historic palmare of the "ros-albastriol".
The team that won the Cup of Campions is in the deoccada.
"It's not a historic break, it's just a competitive break, because we don't have a team, but things can change from next year," said Boroi at Sport.ro.
At the same time, he announces that the process through which he seeks damage from Becali's team will continue.
The period at which we refer to the ICCJ hosting is clearly established.
We have to recover the damage from the FC Steaua, the team that used the Steaua brand without the owner's consent - that is, the CSA Steaua.
It seems very clear and the continuity of the section, which was actually permanent for the army club.
"So the Steaua Bucuresti football team, in some form or other, but in a legal way, must exist as a continuation of the players that have so far in the palmare," says George Boroi.
Becali's star and the Army Club are in open war since the end of last year, when the Supreme Court decided that the military are those who have the flag "Steaua".

The region that "cocket" millions of people
In this year, millions of Asian-Pacicals will form the world's richest group, thanks to the airs accumulated in China and India, a study published Wednesdays by Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management.
According to this document, in 2015, the millions of Asian Pacific will exceed the total $15,800 billion registered in 2014, as well as the millions of North Americas, who currently represent the richest people in the world, with a total of $16,200 billion, transmit AFP.
The study explains that the Asia Pacific region already has the largest number of very rich people, named in the financial jargon High Net Word Individuals, HNWI, with 4.69 million such individuals in 2014, the figure of 4.68 million in North America.
HNWI are people who can invest at least a million dollars, regardless of the value of property and other assets.
"In the future, HNWI's assets are expected to grow more in Asia Pacific than in any other region of the world, most of the new ones are continuing to come from the emerging economies of China, India, Indonesia and Thailand," says the study carried out by Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management.
The report estimates that China and India represent nearly 10% of HNWI's global assets and are responsible for 17% of the global growth of new assets after 2006.
China, the world's second economy after the US, had a figure of 89,000 million in 2014 with a accumulated wealth of $4,500 billion, increasing by 17.5%, respectively 19.3%, compared with 2013.

"Dorol" has set the semaphorus inverse
In Suceava, the workers set up a semafor with the sushi down, so instead of being forced to wait 4 seconds longer, the transiters receive the message "h", which I don't know to decrypt.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Every time he walks like he hits his head.
Two boys were to be taken up by a car because they passed through the rose.
"Politics from Rutiera should be here to help, until the world gets used to," said a woman for the source quoted.
The Semafor was recently mounted in front of the Rock Mary of the center of Suceve, but the transiters don't seem to take any pity on him, as much as the information received appeared to be incomprehensible.
After 6 comes 8, followed by a L, instead of a series 9-8-7.
If "Dorel" is doing the job properly and finds someone responsible enough to give him the ok to finish the job, then it would never have happened in this absurd situation.
Chief of the Management Service Strazi and Systematic Rutiera from the Suceava Prime Minister acknowledged that he was the girl when the semaforr began to work, but did not realize that something was wrong.
We put them in use, but we didn't realize it was a mistake.
"I was actually the girl when they were put into service," said Stefan Vasincu, promising that the problem would be corrected in the shortest time.
Praise the Lord that it can be repaired, because there are situations in which "Dorol" has made the reparable scratch.
For example, when he worked on the Giurgiu-Russia gas pipeline, "Dorel" cut out the drying out of the tunnel under Dunare, he doesn't know where, probably on the floor, he was not found, after he even supported the Ministry of Economy, Mihai Tudose.
The police put the tunnels with water on immigrants
Hungary's main granite with Serbia's Hungarian borders used mercury, water tunnels and lacrimogen gases against immigrants.
Although Hungary has closed the border with a ghampa branch and introduced difficult measures against illegal immigrants, including the arrest, the Sarbo-gungara granite has continued to gather refugees, writes The Guardian.
Water tunnels have been put into effect when immigrants have succeeded in patrolling through the shampoo guard through the crossing point at the Roszke border.
The Hungarian police maintains that the action of the tunnels was a mass of control of the crowd, which throws down water glass.
There are no reports of any rare cases, so some people have complained, after the use of lacrimogen gases.
His publication Enikos writes, at the same time, that the two German companies refuse to release the Hungarian champion.
Tara has already raised the guard at the border with Serbia and March and has announced the intention of raising one and at the border with Romania, a strong initiative criticised at Bucharest.
German companies maintain that the gum sarma is very dangerous and causing infections that can be infected.
It is used to ensure the closures or military facilities, so it should not be used against the people who are looking for it, supported by the companies.
In parallel to the Hungarian border confrontations, Croatia has been mobilized to make it available to bus immigrants to transport those present at the border with Serbia.
Croatian Ministry of Interior confirmed that buses were sent to the border to lead immigrants to the reception centres.
373 people entered Croatia within Serbia, of which 73 children have been shown by the Ministry.
Tsipras, on the Greek drama - why is it agreed with the third agreement with the EU?
The stated purpose of former Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was to save their country from further austerity and to make a fundamental change in their relationship with EU leadership from Brussels.
As a result, the Syrian leader of Greece made part of the third defence agreement for this country, which also involves many years of austerity and reform, according to Euronews, which brings an interview with it.
Now, of course, Tsipras asks the Greeks to reject the first mandate again, in the context of the elections he claims they will take their political position.
Our aim was to get an agreement, not an exit from the euro area or the demise of the euro area.
"Now, for the first time, the possibility of restructuring debt for Greece is open," former prime minister said.
Now, we have an agreement that can be described as a strict one.
"But we know from the beginning that any compromise would have been concluded in the form of an agreement," Tsipras added.
This is the view that the financing part of the agreement is a great success for the Eleanor Government, showing that all the financial needs of tariffs are covered by 2019.
"Alexis Tsipras says that Greece "will certainly need reform," stating that it must begin with state reform.
Tsipras announced his resignation on 27 August, thus opening the way for early elections, in September, after 7 summer months in front of the Athens Executive, the period during which a third rescue force was approved for Greece.
He chose with his broken neck and scratches once he was exposed to electronic print.
A 23-year-old boy in Georgia suffered a stroke of one degree, fracture to the neck and to a finger and a hole like a coin in the throat, after an electronic cigarette that blew a smoke into his face.
James Lauria took a short break in smoking at work, when he had the incident behind the car took a week off to intensive therapy, writes The Daily Mail.
Lauria, who was connected to a breathing device, suffered and shots in her hand and a tooth in her face.
I was at work and things got quiet and I went out for a second, like I always do.
"It's the last thing I remember," said Lauria.
In six weeks after the accident, Lauria can't all begin to lack solid food and follow a liquid diet as she recovers to the place of her parents.
The electronic tiger that has caused barbarity wounds is in the custody of authorities, who conduct an investigation on the incident.

Star Trek's act in prison for breaking up in front of the kids.

The incident that took her to prison, where she is from September 3rd -- the prison being fixed at $2,500 -- took place in front of her house in Tennessee.
The sight began to check with a neighbor, Carey Smith, for one of your children who's crying, inform Mirror.

They're taken in view of the Western munitions.
You don't support terrorism anymore!
Assad's Syrian President Bashar gave a few interviews to the Russian press, in which he spoke of refugees and accused the West of terrorist support and of "visiting" the immigrants.
"Occident weeps for them and the West supports terrorists from the beginning of the crisis, when he said that this is a passive revolution," Assad said, in an interview agreed by Russia Today.
Damascus leader claims that your Western omologists say that Syria is also a terrorist, "but because of the Syrian state or the Syrian regime or the Syrian president."
As long as this propaganda follows, there will be more refugees.
So it's not about the fact that Europe did not accept or denied them as refugees, it's about not dealing with the cause.
If you're pregnant with them, don't support terrorists anymore.
That's what we believe about the crisis.
"This is the core of the whole issue of refugees," added the Syrian leader.
Assad continued the charges at the address of the Western States and with regard to the treatment they showed the refugee face.
It is as the West now weeps for refugees with one eye and takes them in view with the second eye, because those refugees have actually stopped Syria because of terrorism, primarily because of terrorists and crimes and the second round because of the results of terrorism.
"When you have terrorism and the destruction of infrastructure, you won't have the resources of basic life, so many people leave because of terrorism and because they will be punished somewhere in this world," says Bashar of Assad.
"If we ask any Syrian today what he wants, the first thing I would say would be 'We want security and security for every person and every family'," the Syrian president stressed, adding as political forces, whether inside or outside the government, "should be united around what the Syrian people want".
The President of Syria is of the opinion that the dialogue in the country should continue "to reach a consensus", which cannot be implemented "as long as we face terrorism in Syria".
"I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to ask all the forces to fight terrorism because it is the way we can achieve the political objectives that we as Syrians want through dialogue and political action," Bashar of Assad said.
It also spoke of one of its allies, Russian President Vladimir Putin, arguing that, in the context of the Ukraine crisis, it was transformed, from a friend of the West, into his opponent.
Bashar of Assad compares the situation in Syria with that in Russia, accusing the West once again of falsifying reality in both cases.
Note what happened in the western press following the invasion of Ukraine.
What happened?
President Putin was transformed from a friend of the West into an enemy and was described as a tartar.
It is represented as a dictator who removes the opposition from Russia and has reached power through non-democratic means, despite the fact that it was elected in democratic elections, and the West acknowledged that the elections were democratic.
Now, I'm not democratic anymore.
"This is Western propaganda," the Damascus leader pointed out.
Not recently, it included Russia on the list of friends and regional partners - with which Syria is prepared to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, Iran and Iraq 'because it faces the same type of terrorism'.
Instead, Bashar of Assad criticized Turkey, another neighbor, as well as President Recep Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who said that "I can't even make a move without co-ordinating with the United States and with other Western tariffs".
In addition, the President of Syria accused the United States of "International Coalition", which fought against terrorism: "In fact, when this coalition began to operate, the Islamic State began to expand."
In other words, coalition has gone out and has no impact on the ground.
At the same time, tariffs such as Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the West Bank, which provide cover for terrorism, such as France, the United States or others, cannot fight terrorism.
You can't be against terrorism at the same time.
"If these so many decisions to change politics and realize that terrorism is like a scorpion - if you put it in your pocket, it will break you - then we have no intention of cooperating with all of them, in the light of the fact that it is a real and not false coalition that will fight terrorism," the Damascus leader further said.
Toamna?
He's not talking.
Over 30 degrees
The weather will be quite hot Wednesdays, especially in the evenings, where temperatures will exceed 30 degrees.
In Bucharest 26 degrees will be registered at noon.
Two smaller degrees will be on the border, while all 26 degrees at the mountain are announced in Brasov.
It will be 21 degrees to Moeceu, 23 to Bran, 23 to Paraul Rece, 20 to Predeal and 20 to Busteni.
I want something hotter in the heat of the day, where the thermometer is going to go through the 30-degree threshold.

Map of the fares with the biggest fruits and how Romania is
The decline in oil consumption has caused significant losses in the last year to workers in the extraction of the title, energy companies' shareholders and costs that depend heavily on this resource.
Insa exists and a positive effect: gasoline has become huge.
A complete Bloomberg map shows that, in October 2014 - July 2015, almost all the 76 prices taken in the calculation dropped at the cost of fuel.
The most important reduction in pump pressure is seen in Venezuela.
In this country, the engine has grown by 97%, so you can feed 24 SUVs with less than a dollar.
On the opposite side is Saudi Arabia, where the price is fixed by four states.
The cost of the engine varies from ground to ground, depending on refining conditions, changes in taxation, but also fluctuations in the exchange rate.
For a more accurate comparison, Bloomberg has transformed the average price from each state into US dollar.
The Situation in Romania
The Bloomberg data show that, in the second quarter of the year, the average price of a gasoline gallon (about $3.8 litres) was $5.49.
So, we're ranked at 27 in the range of prices with the most expensive fuel.
But we don't have to worry about this position in the top.
The last quarter of 2014, the gas was consumed in Rome.
Then, the average price of a gallon was $6.14, which means a decrease of 10.6%.
However, the streets around are still better.
In Bulgaria, a gas gallon costs $4.92 and in Hungary - $5.20.
You're going to put immigrants on the way in the middle of the night: What Merkel promised
German Chancellor Angela Merkel promised on Tuesday night that the federal government would agree to support the addition of 16 federal countries to the collection and distribution of tens of thousands of migrants entering the country south of Europe.
After a meeting of nearly 4 hours with the prime ministers of the 16 federal states, Merkel stated that "the most important thing now is to create an orderly and transparent process to make the large number of refugees," notes DPA agent.
She added that the federal government will create 40,000 places for initial income, as well as distribution centres.
"I need such pivot points," she pointed out.
All of them must provide a massive push to make the face of the crisis, added Merkel.
The country's prime minister asked for more help than the 6 billion euros agreed by the federal government coalition over a week later.
Prime Minister of Turingie Bodo Ramelow from the Stanga Party asked for a sum of "the small double, and for commitments, to be accelerated", in comments to a local newspaper.
On the border, or, Prime Minister of Renania-Palatinate, Malu Dreyer, urged migrants to be quickly integrated into German society.
"We need a national agreement between all players, not only the federal government, states and municipalities, but also business, trade unions and civil society," she said.
Dreyer also asked that the bureaucracy in the handling of refugees and migrants be accelerated.
She noted that Elvetia completed the process in 48 hours and in 11 days, while Germany needed more than 5 months.
The Prime Minister of Bavaria Horst Seehofer expressed similar feelings.
So far, Bavaria is the worst port in the world, with most migrants who come after crossing the border with Austria.
Seehofer, a powerful federal actor as head of the Crestin-Social Union (CSU), a key component of the federal coalition government, entered into a public conflict with Merkel after the Chancellor announced a virtual policy of use opened at the beginning of the month, recalls DPA.
Mircea Lucescu scans after the humble infringement with Real Madrid
Mircea Lucescu was a nerve car at the end of the game with Real Madrid, which Sahtior Donnetk lost with 0-4.
The Roman coach showed himself totally disturbed by arbitration, saying that the Sahtior lost the order was disappointed.
Before the game I said one thing, that I want to be respected.
On the contrary, in the games with the important teams in Europe, we are always disappointed with arbitration.
There are two totally different ways.
Our new one's got a Galben cardboard right away, while top teams don't.
In addition, the first sentence was not in any case!
Mingea hit him behind Darijo, without touching his hand.
A game like that should not be influenced by arbitration.
"Regreet that the judge broke the game," said Mircea Lucescu at the press conference.
"Mister, but what smells so bad here?"
They were eaten by the broken husband.
A murder of a sadism out of the community threatened the inhabitants of Thargu Frumos and Roman.
Yesterday morning, at the first hours of the day, the merchants from Târgu Floromos were able to see the terrifying scenes near the main market entry.
During the three tombers, the criminals were "collected" from the bones what seemed to be the body of a man.
This was broken, but their head, internal organs, and genitals were missing.
Finally, he had to prove that it was the word of a former officer's body, who had been cut off by his wife, professor of geography.
The "Iaşi Fire" was talking to the taximeter who helped the killer, without knowing, at which sachis with the dead body.
His stories make your hair soft.
The one who warned police yesterday about the fact that a woman with three sashes that were dying of a horrifying fever after eating fresh meat found on the market was a taximetricist from the Frumos Târgu.
As in American films, the man helped himself in transporting bags full of human beaks, which smelled hard, without knowing, the crime being a client for a course.
The taximeter told, except for the "Fire of Iaşi", the scenes he ran through, helping him not to want a murderer to hide the samples.
This was done with the hands of the sashes in which the body of the professor's professor of geography was found.
She came to the Flormos Square to hide the evidence of the crime as far away from her home from Rome.
Maybe he's mine.
I didn't know where you were.
Nea Mihai, as well known by her friends who practice taximetry in Zhargu Frumos, came to see her overnight in the small town where she lives.
He saw American films of his life, but he never thought he would ever be the one who would be the source of the discovery of a sad crime, and he would see with his eyes eating meat.
This tells us that, in the night of the month to March, it is expected that the arrival of automobiles that regularly pass the premises is usually expected.
This is close to the intersection of roads to Roman and Pascani.
The taximetricist reports that the killer woman was observed in a retrovised mirror near the dogs with the meat bags supported by the indicator showing the nearby locations.
She came at night with Massaro's course from 1.30.
The car left it at ten meters of the bridge crossing in the Pascani, right at the bar where the mileage is displayed.
The bags were reassembled with the indicator.
After the car left, I put it in a 10-metre marcher, up to her.
I opened the wallet and, after I put a bag, I asked, "Mister, what smells so bad here?"
I saw that she was an old woman, and I told her to help.
I thought he was taking meat to the market, to the disposal, maybe he had mine, I didn't know where to find him.
I thought he might want to hunt someone with that horrible meat.
She's trying to raise a single bag, and I just stopped helping her.
I put my hand on the top of the bag, where it was tied.
"He specified to take her to the main gate, when I took her out of the car," he began telling Mihai.
I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
He concluded that the woman did not say anything at all, and, as a result, he was no longer curious to ask her anything.
Until I got there, I didn't say anything because I was nervous about putting my coat in my car.
And when he put the bags down from the car, I noticed that he smells worse and worse.
She dropped the bag off the porch.
When I got back in the car, I got two meters back to get back, and I realized I can't stay in the car anymore.
I left the wallet open and moved the car back and forth, to destroy the smell.
At the car, I didn't notice if someone was helped to dig the sand, because I had the lights in the back and I didn't see well in the glasses.
"There were two plastic bags and one rifle," the man completed.
Seeing the woman's strange behavior, she says she's beginning to lose her curiosity.
In my mind, I realized something was wrong.
After he gave her the sand down, I went to the hospital, to the Primery, and when I got back, I forgot to see what the woman was doing with the bag.
She crossed between the warehouse behind the guard, where the tombstones are inside the market.
Then I left again.
It was a little bit aggressive because there was an Italian microwave and a car.
I saw how the woman went to their shoes to get into them, to disappear, but probably the shoes didn't want to take it, because they have international courses, and they don't take vacations.
The woman was very upset, walking back and forth.
At one point, the woman entered Peco, and, curiously, I asked an employee outside what she had done inside.
My girlfriend answered that she went and washed her hands.
Then I asked him where she was the police patrol, because I saw her in a while.
I looked for him and found him coming to the market.
I showed them the woman and I told them it was a suspect.
"Then I went to the other side, a course to the Belcesti," completed Mihai.
He told us that the woman had become pregnant after she left the bathroom in the bedroom.
To me, the suspicion went away from the fact that he disappeared, and I was curious what he did to him.
When the police went to her, they asked her what she was doing there and they showed her to me, telling her I warned her that she had a suspicious bag.
Then the woman went to the bedroom and showed them the bathroom.
"I went back to the place where he hid the bag around 3 hours when I gave the police and prosecutors from the place," and ended the taximetric report.
The prosecutors of Neamç, who investigate the case, say that the 64-year-old professor, Ana Zaharia, was surprised by the rooms of a gas station in Rome at 0.55 hours, entering the three cars.
She's reached the Furmos Square at 1.30 p.m.
According to the investigators, she would have killed her husband, who had been married for four years, with a knife, then betrayed her into the house.
The man was named Gheorghe Zaharia, and he was a reserve officer.
On Sunday night, the woman put the meat in two plastic bags, which she carried to her car, and hid.
Otherwise, he transported another one, then he decided to go, and chose the Bucharest Car - Yesi.
Yesterday, prosecutors still didn't know where his wife's internal organs were hiding, nor his genitals.
But the head was found in newspapers and pungies, in a detour from the woman's apartment.
She was retired, like her husband.
So far, prosecutors have not found out from the woman who was the reason that she killed her husband with such cold and sad blood.
The most likely, the professor will be trained psychologically, and the body will be examined by legal doctors, in order to officially determine the cause of death and any other relevant details.
The first took over the national roads of the municipality, following years of the government's initiative, to be able to spend money on the national budget in an electoral campaign in 2004.
The decision was adopted yesterday by the Local Council (CL) and a decision of the Government is required to be applied.
Some sources say that the transfer of the right of administration from the Regional Directorate of National Roads was a matter of discretion because it was in a position to agree with the opinion of the General Banistic Plan (PUG).
The Prime Minister has taken a network of 11 km roads.
In any case, a legislative amendment which was adopted in July 2015 forced the municipality to adopt the national roads that cross the municipality.
No opinion can be delivered from the National Roads unless the law is complied with, so it was necessary to approve this.
National roads have been in our administration since today.
"Of course, government decision will have to be issued in the light of this decision of the Local Council," said prime minister Mihai Chirica.
The national roads in the municipality are DN 24 and DN 28.
The 28th National Road beats Iaşul on the arterials: the Piacuri, the Mountain Road (to the left), the Moara de Fire, the Silvestr road, Bd. Nicolae Iorga, Bd. Primaveri, the Way of Chišinė, the Muteni Street until the exit of the municipality to Tomešti - Albizia.
The other national road, DN 24, covers the Bucium, Bd. Socola (up to Semafor), Bucium Street (up to Base 3), Chišinau Street, Bd. Tudor Vladimirescu, Bd. C.A. Rosetti and exit to Carlig-Scullene.
Radu Gyr and Eliade
Further describing files from Mircea Eliade's youth political sympathy which, although convicted, would have shown too much the size of a daily article and should be disseminated in a series, worthy, believed, the friendship of Radu Gyr and Mircea Eliade, one of the most frequent charges used by the Romanian leading dictators.
A less humorous description would be, hopefully, useful in the real debate on which the recent law, says "anti-legionary", would be able to distinguish it from the Romanian intellectual environment.
Analyzing the various versions of Eliade's reorganization in the Law through the "Axa" Cup and Radu Gyr, Florin Üurcanu brings into discussion, in the Mircea Eliade volume.
The prisoner of history (Bucurešti, 2003), another hypothesis, which is of utmost interest to us in the understanding of the resolution of the epistolic contacts between Radu Gyr and Eliade in 1968, after Ceaușescu played the "Balcony scene" in August of that year.
Based on the documents signed by Radu Gyr under pressure during the security investigation in 1941, documents stored today in the SRI archive (FD, Dosaral 573, f.15) as well as on a post notice from 1938, Florin Üurcanu said that "Eliade will not enter their group, but in that sense "Legionary family" called the Light, a group of intellectuals, especially writers, led by the Radu Gyr poet".
Since there is no verifiable data on the Luminance gate, those in exile taking into account the existence of this "legiation family", what should be discussed is, until the context in which this information was recorded in the directory.
Leaving the SRI’s amazing ability to make these secret documents available to Mr. Türcanu, it is more than obvious that, at that time, the security guard was "Commandant" Radu Gyr, referring to Eliade, in the context that Armand Călinescu, Minister of the Interior had taken all the necessary steps to be able to impose the Royal Decree, suspending the parliamentary life and eliminating the main political force of the legionists who began to enjoy an unexpected popularity (the entire country of the three-thirds of the year).
Eliade's arrest was carried out as a result of this note, quoted by Uurcanu: "Eliad Mircea, writer and journalist, founded in the legal movement in 1935 in the group of writers and poets under the leadership of Professor Radu Demetrescu Gyr."
As far as I am concerned, I see this note as a bureaucratic coverage underpinning for the repression in 1938 and it is likely that such superficial notes would be made at the table for the vast majority of legionists or sympathizers active in the public space who were to be arrested, but who were to be bound by an important legionary leader.
Radu Gyr's olograph statement above, given in the arrest, in February 1941, after the legionary rebellion, does nothing but confirm retrospectively at first, the bureaucratic approach in any police regime, authoritarian.
It would be interesting if the Urcanu would have provided more details about the contents of the 573 folder quoted above.
Was it Eliade's or Radu Gyr's file?
Because it must be a document built on the basis of security documents, but then processed for security to be used either against one or the other.
There is an error here, as is the case with the use of the term "member" of the Movement, which only someone who knows the acquisition of the internal structures of this radical organization based on a religious foundation knows that it represents a pre-marketing stage, of course, in which the person concerned acts as an active sympathizer, found during a three-year trial before becoming a "cooperative" by law.
Also, all these forms of secondary organisation, such as intellectual clubs or workshops, sitteries, discussion groups with countries, youth organisations or students pregnant around a cave, were his "family", were not his own voice, as a form of political organisation and action.
This kind of excitement completely escapes the unsuspecting reader by making Eliade's "member" status (which may be funny) understandable and used to write to designate political reorganization in the cave.
Of course, the appeal of this kind of interpretation subtilities cannot hide the public activity of Gárzi's support and no clear sympathy for the Captain who encouraged Eliade in the period 1935-1940, whether or not in the Nae Ionescu site.
The public support of a cause in which you believe, however, does not necessarily mean, and the political regime itself says more and more to the extent that the intellectuals of this platform maintain a sort of superiority over activities as a target and does not go into politics than when they are directly offered the privilege.
As far as I could think of Eliade's kind of thinking during that period, in which he was "the leader of the younger generation," I find it hard to believe that he would have accepted the hierarchical constraints of a legitimate sphere.
And Radu Gyr didn't have Nae Ionescu's intellectual ascendant, however!
To say no more than in the past, the fact that, in any legitimate "dos", what is being done is the public activity anti-Semitted as well as violence, both of which is to be stigmatized, but in the case of Eliade, up to our trial.
As for Eliade-Gyr's correspondence between 1968-69, Mircea Handoca, a advocate of Eliade, tries to punish Florin Úurcanu's claims (but based on some archive documents, even if they were considered to be disseminating and contextualized) with a more serious argument.
Mircea Hadoca notes, in the Noi vote on Mircea Eliade (Bucureşti, 2006), that "no part of the correspondence between Mircea Eliade and Radu Gyr has no justification for this framework".
Nor had he been like in 1968, when, when he came out of the communist camps, Radu Gyr could not have taken any chances in a letter that was obviously intercepted by censorship.
What I think she wanted to underline Mircea Handoca is the fact that the tone of these letters sent by Radu Gyr was a respectful, admiration and affection without any doubt about Eliade's arrival.
There's really not even the most noble suggestion that, ever, Radu Gyr would have been Eliade's boss.
Intelligent, the poet forced to write on the Patri’s Glass, derives from the position of standing by signaling Eliade (which he knew very well exactly what the mission had been doing with the continuous denigation of the right exile), in signature, after "your old friend" what to expect and is apparently easy and happy when it responds to his emotional response after nearly three decades of separation since "the viclean time" has stopped him.
There is no doubt about the fact that, apart from the "mission" with which Eliade was loaded (to convince him that now in the new Romania, he could come back alone even to see his mother and friends) and that, by means of short proposals, apart from paragraph, Radu Gyr shows his interest only for literature.
It does not speak of esoteric austerity, of refined political complications, or of any mention of youth age in a register other than cultural.
It is hard to believe that Radu Gyr would have been superior to Eliade's legal line, but until this version was consolidated with less tangible evidence than the Florin Uurcanu's offer, we have in this corresponding memory chips that testify to a mutual value of people who have marked different, but stately, our culture and which, in addition to the complete trials of life, governs the tone of civilization and interbbel education.
Important human and cultural documents and, why not?, pulsating for the strength of friendship and mutual respect beyond the "time" destination of authors.
At the beginning of the 1970s, Eliade finally withdrew from the refugee status of the American citizen and, under the pretext offered by health problems and flood disasters in the country, announced to the RSR authorities, through the embassy (with which he carried a sporadic correspondence used to get a passport for his sister), that he could not pass the invitation to return to the country.
The following was predictable: it's again added to the index, "toladot business" is being installed in Israel, the family and friends' sent papers (Fragments of a newspaper, Gallimard, 1973) are stopped by censorship, and never reviews their mother.
Among friends from the country with Noica is only one more sporadic correspondence, although, surprisingly, such as a personal witness from Chicago, a number of private persons or Romanian institutions are more able to send messages to them.
It's clear why Radu Gyr no longer received permission to write it after 1969.
And after 1977, when the Ceauşescu regime tried to convince Eliade's second convince operation (by formal invitations, Noica's duties, translations, etc.) Radu Gyr has already passed through in prison.
New coach, foreign player
As a result of the fall of autohone volunteers, Penicilina Iași was tested in sports tournaments in Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Poland.
Exhibits participate in training tournaments under the command of trainer Dan Gavril
Retrograded in the first half of the year of the Women's Will Division, Penicillina Iaşi kept the place in the first sample due to the withdrawal and then the development of the Miroslava Science formation, which was promoted in the first sample following a baraj tour even in the exit community.
The news took little by little the driving out of the group, which remained without main coach (after the departure of Rareș Puni, second to the Bacau Science) and many missing players, some delays such as Cristina Lung and liberal Diana Stuineanu, or left, as Ana-Maria Berdilă (at the Volilee Alba Blì) and sisters Maria and Iuliana Ficá.
Fires, until the start of the campaign scheduled on October 10, there was and there was more time to complete the batch.
First, a new trainer was found in Dan Gavril's person, from LPS Piatra Neamț's team, who has worked less in the last few years at the Penicilina, hoping to sign a contract with the team led by the Far East Vasile.
Then two players were brought from the Miroslava Science, Raluca Pichiu and Tatiana Diaconição, being tested and several foreign players from Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Poland, almost transferred by the Serbian player Katarina Jovanovic (from Amiens, France) and the Montenegrin Jelena Cvijovic (Zrenjanin).
At the beginning of the month, the penicillin battalion led by Dan Gavril performed a singing at Gura Humorului, after which he participated in a tournament held at Lugoj and equipped with the Cup of Banat, in which the outputs won a victory (3-0 with Cluj University), but also had two mistakes, 0-3 with CSM Lugoj and SCMU Craiova.
Next week, on September 23-25, the Penicillin will participate in another tournament in Craiova.
For the new champion we're trying to reach a valuable team.
We have a valuable coach and experience, but the player fund in Romania is quite small and therefore we will call on foreign volunteers, especially after deciding that teams can use an unlimited number of players outside the country.
This decision will affect the young generation of sports from clubs in Romania.
"We were hoping to reach the end of the competition year at the 5-6 locations, even if it would be very difficult," said Vasile Left, president of the ACS Penicilina Iaşi.
It's an exciting meeting.
People gathered after nearly 70 years
The people George Krzynecky and Lucian Poznanski, 69 years old, were born at the end of the Second World War, in Germany, after their Polish mother had just been released from a labor camp.
Because she was too sick to care for them, the people were sent to Poland to adopt, the two brothers were so separated not only from what gave them life, but also from one another.
Ten years George and Lucian didn't know one of the others.
At the age of 17, George discovered documents showing that he was adopted and that he has a brother.
In the 1960s, she asked the Red Cross to help her find the brothers, but they found no trace to lead her to Lucian.
Soon in 2015, thanks to the program, “Restoring Family Links” of the Red Cross, the people met, and the moment was more than emotional.
BBC reporters surprised this episode.
Ten children from Iaşi brought home from Stuttgart four medals to sports dance
Two gold medals, a silver medal and a bronze were won by the children who came out to the German Open Championship from Stuttgart, an international sports dance competition organised by the German Federation of Dance Sports and the World Federation of Dance Sports.
From Iaşi they participated in five parties training at the Dance Energy Club and dancing with 9,000 sportsmen from 20 countries.
The 10 children out of the group participated in five different categories (young people 1, youth 2, June 2, youth and amateurs).
Those who returned home with the medals were the pearls: Răzvan Andrei Zaharia and Ana Maria Târzianu (two medals of gold and silver), Vlad Constantin Donosă and Otilia Čtefana Gologan (Bronz medal).
And three other passages have succeeded in occupying front seats: Bogdan Stelian Duminica and Sara Maria Dolniceanu, Vlad One and Antonia Ioana Iosub Cujbă and not in the last quarter of Andrei Emilia and Raluca Elena Ioniță.
As a coach, I wanted to confirm the results achieved in March of this year, this confirmation is necessary for both us and sportsmen as regards their future evolution.
The fact that we were able to hear the novel of Romania twice this year at German Open and return home with four medals brings us great joy and hope and confidence that we can raise both the club and its sportsmen to a higher level.
"All of this would be possible only with a few important elements: involvement, respect, trust and a lot of work," said Andrea Ramona Manolache, the teacher of children at the Dance Energy Club.
Romania was represented in this year by 34 clubs from the country, making a total of 9 media, thus qualifying our country at 4 of the 20 participating countries.
Of the nine medals, four came to Yashii.
6 way to relieve stress in a minute
Very few of us are allowed to escape one weekend from the mountain to escape stress.
Some have time, others have financial resources, and still others have both limitations.
There's so much in demand that anyone wants to escape some stress.
These do not involve any higher costs and no special time allocated, according to lyla.ro.
Day care is inevitable, but it depends on us how we treat them and how we treat them.
Instead of driving inside and feeling like an implosion takes place in your mind, you better try the next relaxation tactics you haven't stolen for more than a minute.
Breathe breath
Respiratory exercises are not intended for soloists or yoga practitioners only.
They work for every man in part, and controlling breathing in a tense moment helps release endorphin into the body, a process that leads to a relaxation stand, informing Livestrong.
Children
We know we've gone too long for the kids, and we're not allowed to stand up when we have our boss.
But that doesn't mean that we can't go into a chair of offices or whatever we know we're alone (even behind the roof) and don't type as much as we have the flames.
You can get rid of nerves and negative energy accumulated over a day with some healthy collections.
Imagine a beautiful place
We know that the recommendation calls for a replication during a psychotherapy session, but I didn't give up on psychology.
Imagine a beautiful place, which inspires us with peace and calmness of the sun’s fury, can lead to the slowing of the nerves.
It's really about self-sustainment, the procedure that can actually change lives, both in good and in bad.
It's all up to what we're suggesting.
The best thing to do is look at us in an indical place that warms our soul.
Listen to music
Put your chests in your ears and listen to relax music.
Attention, it's not the word of music that's preferred, because if it's the word of heavy metal, you might be hit hard to relax.
Listen to even relaxation melodies, which are lined and do not contain verses, to rule the balance when you open the file.
Decojit or portocal
Is it strange the idea of decoying or portoque into the nerves?
Well, it's not!
If it's not the word of fruit in itself, because it doesn't contain a miraculous substance or Xanax to disconnect us completely (occupy, too).
It's about aroma therapy!
The smell of portocal coji, during the decoy, stimulates the brain to produce endorphine, a hormone of good old age.
Mangaie an animal
Those who have animals near, whether it's the word of the house, or the word of the one who's sitting around the place of work, take a few seconds to wash it.
According to the U.S. National Center for Infectious Diseases, animal manipulation can reduce blood pressure.
hour and rock with violet and guitar
Two musical musicians attracted by instruments like rivals, but collaborators in this acoustic project, sing Enescu, Vivaldi, Bach, Piazzola, Brahms, Mancini, Brubeck, Jobim, Django, Zeppelin, Purple, Queen, Floyd, but also famous parts of the Roman folklore combined with guitar.
The acoustic project belongs to the musicians Cristian Horia and Emilian Florentin Gheorghe and is entitled WHEN Violin Meets Guitar, writes hotnews.ro.
Florentin: "We found us, and since then it has made us very happy to sing together, opening an unlimited practical repertoire."
We thought that was the moment a vicar met with a guitar.
Cristi: "From the first time we realized that what we sing is very good and that, in view of the human component, things work."
Each of us has learned from the passage of the cell repertoire and, what is very important, is that the sounds of both instruments match.
Florentin: "I know there is a gap between classical music and the rest."
I think many people can listen to classical music.
And in the second round we stole a Queen, a Deep Purple, our old rockers and, of course, jazz.
We want to find the point between the genes, we want to offer a kind of music that could do to those who only listen to classical music to listen and rock, and to those who listen only to rock to reach their tastes and classical music.
And I had a surprise to tell us at the end of a concert that they never imagined they'd listen to something like that and they'd like it.
Kristi: "When we find young people -- and we find more in -- who know who Pink Floyd was, it doesn't seem to be adorable."
The Jesuits were more trafficked than at school on the first day after the holiday
Hundreds of exits were "captiv" yesterday in hell traffic from more areas.
The Prime Minister announced that today the Mangeron bulevard is closed between Tudor Vladimirescu and Podu Roş.
The Prime Minister did not respect the promises of carrying out work for the smoothing of traffic once during the school year.
One of the guarantees that the municipality has given them, at least twice in the past few weeks, has been in the restoration of the grid of the International Garden.
Although only a few elements of the interim were to be set up, and the last time of the work was the end of the last week, yesterday the grid was not carried out.
The irony of the drivers was overcome to the maximum on Nicolae Iorga and Cantemir, since another Prime Minister's promise was violated: the shift of the Vamal activity of Nicolae Iorga to Tehnopolis "after late August", in the context of which the transfer is still under discussion since 2012.
Currently, Prime Minister Mihai Chirica says the problem of the International Gara is more complex.
The rotation will be made at the right time, we need to take into account the movement of traffic in the area, we need an opinion and the National Roads.
"It's not like in Zimbru, where it's time for the tramway to stay in the grid, but we'll sort it out," said Chirica.
One of the solutions, according to this, would be the stop of the tramway with a semaphore before giraffe.
Problems in circulation were also in the intersection of Podu Roš.
The car code on the road The Holy Lazár was extended to the SRI seat.
"I've waited a good minute to get out of Podu Roš," said one out.
By Podu Roș, the route to the CUG was to be completed in September if the project for the Rehabilitation of South Functional Art was completed in the initial implementation (31 July 2015).
There are two projects that complete it at first.
"I have drawn European funds for new jobs, for example overhauling, on the initial variant of the Nicolina Pass was pleasant," Chirica said.
The most recent deadline for the reintroduction of traffic is October.
During the day yesterday, the exits reported traffic problems especially in areas such as the Pacuri, the Centre (Targu Cucu, Independence, the Armenian Road) or the intersection of Base 3.
Admission could come back as head of the CJ.
In the morning you'll know for sure.
The Judges of the Court will decide tomorrow if the Vice-President of the Judiciary Council maintains judicial control and prohibitions.
The judges of the Court of Justice of Iaşi resolved a new term in the "Album" document yesterday, where the defendant is also the Vice-President of the Judician Council.
At the end of yesterday's sitting, the judges decided to speak in the morning on the judicial control measure currently imposed against the Admonition.
This latter would like to take this measure in place or withdraw it, which is held away from the CJ Chief's seat for months.
In the case of a favourable solution, and if this is to be remembered naked and of the Supreme Court, Christian Admonition will be able to resume its role as President of the CJ.
The administration was sent to the Court of Justice of the National Anticoruption (DNA), accused of favouring the manufacturer and intellectual errors after they said to the nurses, it would have been tried to mask an audit check, after which a number of irregularities regarding the reception of a public contract signed between CJ and Laser Co would have been detected.
The administration would have tried to hide the fact that the institution which led it would not have received any further promotional materials from the Court of First Instance, although Scripturally these materials were made available by CJ.
In addition to him, the justice and three directors of the CJ, but also the administrator of Laser Co.
Another 3,500 exits are expected to vote until 25 September
The first is ready to distribute further issues if the 12,000 will be affected.
The exits have only ten days to express their opinion on the replanting of the teas on the Estefan of the Sea.
According to the municipal officials, up to now about 8,500 of the 12000 questionnaires distributed to the centre of the city and three other additional points (Copou Park, the Grand Duchy and the Prime Minister) have been completed.
A record number of exits appeared Sunday in front of the Prime Minister.
According to the representatives of the civil group, "The Day Loves You", 530 exits voted in 140 minutes, respectively almost four votes expressed in each minute.
Instead, throughout the day of the month, about 440 people came out in the same place.
Volunteers of the group say that many exits announce notification and the population is becoming inefficient of public consultation.
As a result, they made an appeal yesterday to Internet users to print a display of information placed on the group's disposal and to cut it into block downloads.
In addition, the volunteers showed that at the additional point in the Copou Park, the last form was completed by Sunday's exits.
We're going to offer a form from the centre of the cartel, where it's not too complete.
"The possible supplements we will do when all the 12,000 forms will be completed," said municipal spokesman Sebastian Buraga yesterday.
"Scrotch the zeros" will end on 25 September, and if the majority vote of the exits is in favour of the replanting of the goats then the Prime Minister will plant your silvers in this tom.
The exits can express their opinion at the centre of the charter of Dcia, Flormoasa, Tatárasii, Nicolaina and Pacuria, as well as in the additional points mentioned above.
The Prime Ministers decided to close the streets of Åtefan the Mare in early 2013, an action that drew an amendment to 60,000 municipal law.
The decision was adopted unilaterally, without consultation of the population, and led to the spontaneous appearance of the civil group "Iash loves you", an online community that covers about 13,500 people.
In the virtual environment, a petition initiated by the civil replanting group was signed by over 9,100 supporters until evening.
RECORD of enrolled students at USAMV Iaşi!
I'm 920 in the year I
The university has 920 students this year in the year I.
The representatives of the University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine "Ion Ion Ion Ionescu de la Brad" explained that this year were the most widely accepted candidates ever from the history of the higher education institution from birth.
We are very grateful for the results of this year's admission.
We have the largest number of candidates admitted from university history, about 920 students in the first year. We've never had such a number.
"We've also had candidates with larger averages, we've occupied the budget positions at the license and master," said Prof. Dr. Ioan zenu, the prosecutor responsible for the educational activity.
This further explained that the university has registered a considerable number of students at the tax level, with 20% of the respective places, a significant number more than in other years.
Although the results have also been published in the Romanian language study lines, the admission to the English study programme from the University of Veterinary Medicine, which has dropped to 50 competitions, with a rate of 5 000 euros, and is now expected to respond to the Minister for the confirmation of the students' files and the necessary study visas.
At the autumn session a total of 120 files were posted on 14 budgeted locations and 209 selected for competition in the "tax" scheme at the licensing studies.
Most of the files were from the University of Agriculture, 75, Horticulture was 23, and Zootehnie, 22.
At the master's session, 18 files were delivered, at 150 places on the tax proposed by USAMV, seven of them on Agriculture, five on Horticulture and six on Zootehnie.
The drivers are afraid of entering the car wheels into the Tudor Vladimirescu bridge.
The village over the Bahlui from the Tudor Vladimirescu bulge stayed as quiet as when the "Fire of Iaşi" wrote about the problems they had, 10 days later.
Our daily report then points out that on the axis that delimites the two senses of walking the asphalt, it appears that deep groups, some even 20 centimetres, are seen in concrete squares that represent the primary infrastructure of the floor.
Also, the asphalt has begun to form part of the axis, before signs of the depth will be attached.
At the same time, Prime Minister Mihai Chirica states that the bridge does not have structural problems, with a technical expertise recently being carried out in order to launch a project to rehabilitate the bridge and the pipelines of EUR 5 million.
The first Chilean states that the area affected by fissures and fumes will be signalled, following rapid recovery of the asphalt.
The only measures taken so far have been the installation of small and signalling tapes, without even a simple blast.
During this period, we have focused more on opening schools and the things needed for this purpose.
"It is currently a point-by-point expert for the post we are waiting for about a week with the necessary details of the intervention, considering that in at least two weeks we could go through the process," the interim prime minister said.
At the beginning of the school year
Yesterday, my eldest son, Stefan, started school.
The preparatory class, as he tries to improve the situation.
I don't know if I'm happy or I'm left with melancholy; turn, passive, to the second variant.
First of all, because I felt like they only spent three weeks, not three years when I first went to college with emotion.
Although it is easy to give up, not even a normal parent is pleased to see their children grow up.
Secondly, because I remember the same day from my childhood, it started a story that didn't end until today.
I wasn't exactly what's usually called a conscientious student.
On the contrary, I'd say.
But I always liked school.
So much that I chose to continue to practice it, even if as a teacher.
When I decided that's what I want to do all my life, I knew it wasn't an easy mission.
And no one with a month off.
That's because, like each of us, I've given over the whole class of teachers: better or worse, more sympathetic or insensitive, more impatient or right-wing.
It happens, in sin, that there are people with other names in this breasal.
I think these are toxic, because it relieves enthusiasm and even the mind of a young man willing to form himself.
I've had the chance to give, as long as I was a student or a student, over a few, a few, butchers.
These meetings can be decisive if they take place at the right time.
Who believes that the role of the cathedral is the base of the transmission of some information is ammaratic.
This can be done by anyone; of course, it can be reported to the student very well by one alone, that we only live in the time of transparency.
A good teacher models the mind of the students.
He's making them, he's complaining about them.
Staying in the cathedral is not a privilege, as I think it is, but a great responsibility.
Young people are very mobile, they are demanding, indifferent, and always willing to look for the hives of those ahead of them.
That's how old they are, the temperature.
As a teenager, we all thought that we knew everything, that we were certain of anything.
When we grow up, we get to understand that we only have doubts.
Therefore, the role of a teacher is to get him out of his self-sufficient category and make him think.
I mean, it's up to him to doubt, ask his questions.
Find out on your own answers, whether they or the sponsors.
Get involved in everything he does.
To keep him discreet to useful models.
It's very difficult, especially that most times the student thinks the teacher is his enemy.
One who's just waiting to take his feet wrong to punish him.
But it justifies him, the senseless, rebellious pure, to live fully with the old names, to look at him from the cathedral with suspicion.
That he just doesn't have a natural response to his attempt to order him.
Adolescents are not allowed to play at the point, they are not allowed to impose restrictions.
Ori, if I imagine I'm doing it, she's fighting something.
And, of course, when there is a rigid person at the cathedral who insists on being long and uncommunicative, the students argue on the subject presented.
There are thousands of such young people who rate the meetings with the great writers, the poets, because of the lack of tact by the Romanian teacher.
They're thousands of students who have the impression that history is a closed-up, that mathematics is all that can be more difficult for their uncognizable mind.
I always encourage my students: if you give it to a teacher who doesn't hug him, who doesn't know how to communicate as from man to man with you, don't let him separate you from the literature to which you should be addressed.
How did it happen to me that I became the doll myself?
I had a very good teacher in the VI-VIII classes.
He opened my mind to some texts that have been speaking to the Puber since then on his understanding.
I met a university professor who opened my library door.
I looked at him as a man from another world: he had lost his house covered with dirty paper bags.
I lost myself in his library, and I wanted to have one.
Now I might have it, but, if I hadn't taken my sister off the road, I might have decided to make myself a football player.
Or an engineer or a lawyer or anyone else knows what.
I don't think such meetings are happening.
I don't think so.
The important thing is to hand over the man who's gonna take you out of hand and take you patiently to your own vocation.
And this is, most often, the teacher.
Now, my experience helps me to discuss just what it means to preach the literature.
It's just that literature can't be passed.
There's no literature teacher, just like there's a math teacher.
How do you define the inconsistencies?
You can, at least, approach him, without pretending to convey petrified truths.
The one in the cathedral can be the most guided reading, that's all.
But especially you can use some wonderful meetings, between a reader and some paper.
There are meetings that can change the life of the bank.
There are meetings that I can open their mind, that I can lift, talk to someone, tears in their eyes.
Therefore, the teacher of literature must first succeed in making students understand (they feel) that there is no divorce between literature and life.
Dispatch!
A great poet, Al. Paleologu, says one thing just seemed paradoxical: "How much literature, such life, not reverse!" and he was right.
That's why a good desk prepares you for life, doesn't make you a specialist in any open area.
Happily, we've always learned how many things.
And we, professors; or especially us, professors.
Most often, it simply repeats a great truth: not only the scientists have learned from their masters, but also the inverse.
In an ideal way, the teacher should be a teacher and a murderer.
Which, like any valuable young man, leaves his master when he discovers his own way.
At least I find him, he's right.
But the master was the one who opened the stage.
I don't think there's a greater happiness for a professor of blood than that to stand up for so many such divisions.

FIFA is being searched throughout
U.S. Justice and Switzerland will lead to new arrests
The American and Swiss authorities have announced that criminal penalties will begin in the case of new persons and organisations, in the context of the FIFA corruption investigation, inform the international press.
U.S. Justice Minister Loretta Lynch announced, in a press conference held in Zurich, that the area of investigations on corruption in the world football was enlarged.
"On the basis of our cooperation and on the basis of new tests, we will commit additional penalties to the address of new individuals and of new organisations," Lynch said.
In May, many higher FIFA responsibilities were arrested in Switzerland in this case of corruption.
Many of them have already been expelled from the United States.
"We had hope that other criminal followers would reach the United States," Lynch added.
Switzerland's Attorney General Michael Lauber, also present at the press conference, said that his institution has put the stock of more goods, including housing and land in the Alps, as well as financial assets, in the research carried out in collaboration with the US.
"We haven't even reached the end of the first rehearsal," said Lauber.
So far, a very large amount of information has been confiscated, 11 terabytes.
At the same time, 121 bank accounts are investigated.
In the interest of the investigators, a contract for the award of media rights was entered into at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and in 2014 - Brazil.
FIFA faces a major scandal of corruption, after the U.S. court accused 14 people, with two Vice-Presidents of FIFA and seven officials of the forum.
The persons held are researched for imitation and other uses from the early 1990s and so far, totaling more than 150 million dollars.
Following this scandal, Swiss Swiss Joseph Blatter announced, at the beginning of July, that he would resign from the FIFA's position as president, after it was real for five hours.
Battle as a movie at the theater
In the Gala Supekombat of Milano, the exorcist Cătálin Moroșanu will fight "the beast" James Wilson
A series of Romanian fighters, including the "scorpion" of the Moroșanu City, will participate on October 2, in the Supercombat Gala from the 4 Ciak linear theatre in Milan, the last before the end of November, is shown in a communication message MEDIAFAX.
We were impressed by the atmosphere last year, and as I promised, we'll come back to this tom with a new five-star gala.
If we've always chosen a place of entertainment, a theater, then we promise to fight like in the movies.
We'll have eight Romanian fighters in the event program.
Along with the games with already dedicated views, we will have another gallery open, which will include the best fighters of the new generation, including the Romanians Cristi Speccu, Christian Stancu and Amansio Paraschiv.
"It will soon be announced and the full programme will be announced," said promoter Eduard Iremia.
The city of Moroșanu will fight under the Galway Supercombat World Grand Prix Final Elimination with American James Wilson, after he participated in the last pyramid in the hard-organized category in Japan and the number of prizes from bodybuilding contests in 2012.
I'm just waiting to fight in Italy.
I've seen Wilson, he's a real animal, but I admire him!
I'm still angry that last year I couldn't finally fight, so now I'm gonna fight him.
"The animal turns him into a psyche," said Moroşanu.
As of 2015, the Andrei and Bogdan Stoica brothers will have the last talks in Italy before the World Cup on 7 November in the final sea.
Last year, both of them were implicated by KO in Italy, and now I promise they'll repeat the scenario.
I'm glad I'm back in Italy, the atmosphere last year was incredible.
"I just hope to meet the fans there again and promise them a new show of neutat," said World Championship Andrei Stoica.
Milano will also fight Raul Cătinaș with an opponent that will be set up.
A girl invited the queen of England to her day, but she wrote her letter
A British girl sent Queen Elizabeth an invitation to participate in her birthday.
At the same time, the six-year-old girl congratulated the Queen for her longest lady, but she didn't forget to mention that she didn't allow her access to the Buckingham Palace when she went to visit her family.
The writing didn't leave without an egg, but the girl received an answer from the representatives of the Royal House.
The Queen thanked her for the invitation, but asked and apologized that she could not be present on September 27, because she even hated to have fun with family and friends.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor and Adrian Páunescu were invited together to a talk show shortly before the poet Adrian Páunescu died.
Both writers died from heart.
Adrian Păunescu's fate and Vadim Tudor's fate are similar.
Both of them were writers and politicians, and both grew up near the age of their heart.
Adrian Páunescu at 67, Vadim Tudor at 65.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor and Adrian Páunescu were invited together in 2010, shortly before Adrian Páunescu died, at a TV Realty show.
In addition, Vadim Tudor ironed Gheorghe Flutur and criticized Elena Udrea, then Minister of Tourism, for the situation of Romanian tourism.
At one point, Vadim Tudor told Adrian Páunescu, with a smile on his face, "I admire your reputation, Adrian."
Punescu, laughing and he answered, "It's not too glorious what you told me right now."
Adrian Păunescu died on November 5, 2010, at the age of 67.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor died today, September 14, 2015, at the age of 65.
Two people inconsistencies after a Dumbrava ACCIDENT
An accident took place last night around 19:00 at Dumbrava in the village of Iaşi.
A bicyclist was taken up by a Volkswagen Autotourism.
The ciclist wasn't noticed by the driver.
Fortunately, they're both stable.
As a result of the impact, the brakes and the mirror of the car were divided.
Two people injured are unconscious at the hour of transmission of this news.
A SMURD team is on its way to provide medical assistance to the victims and transport them to the hospital.
The police are on the spot.
A Syrian artist turned Super Mario into a refugee
A Syrian artist has created a version of the popular game "Super Mario", which deals with the difficult situation of his partners, on their way to Europe.
Instead of presenting Italian installer Mario's adventures in the Government of the Ciupers, the modified video game is central to the Mario Refugee.
The person is trying to cross the traffic of persons and border police on his way to a refugee centre in the European Union.
The artist established in Istanbul uses the Samir al-Mufti pseudonym for security reasons and declared that he had performed the video game with Mario refugee after his friends had arrived on a dangerous journey to Europe to escape the horrors of the war.
At the Craiova Detention Centre the youngest student is 15 years old and is in Class I
Justice Minister Robert Cazancious said, at the opening of the school year at the Craiova Detention Centre, that the youngest student is 15 years old and is in Class I, and the largest is 25 and is in Class XI, showing that they could have a different life if they went to school.
I have chosen to participate in the opening of the school year in a centre belonging to the National Pensions Administration to try to attract attention, and in this way, on less-known realities.
The youngest student, aged 15, is enrolled in Class I, and the largest is 25 years old and is enrolled in Class XI.
"There are complex subjects that the company is concerned about discussing at this moment, we are all stressed by its own concerns and problems, but we do not have to go through with the lesson that they are over 100 young people from the Craiova Detention Centre offering," said Minister Robert Cazancious at the opening festival of the school year.
The Ministry of Justice drew attention to the fact that lack of education, motivated in many cases by lack of material opportunities, may lead to tragedies, stating that young people in this centre would have another chance in life if they could have followed the high school course of any child, if they had the opportunity not only to write, read, but also to receive a set of moral values, to find out what it means to respect the law and what consequences it may have.
"The role of the prison system is not that of the permanent isolation of societies of people who have violated the law, of closing them behind high walls, and of trying to rehabilitate and prepare them, because when they return to the community they have more chances of reintegration," Cazancious added.
The Minister stated that it is necessary to invest in schools, hospitals, roads, but investment must be made and in the prison system, because, in many cases, conditions of detention are limited to humanity and because, in the absence of money and personnel, it will be difficult to talk about the reintegration of convicted persons.
We are working very well with the Ministry of Education and due to this partnership, each year, in the prison system, more than 2,000 graduates of school education courses.
Of course, we won't be able to change over the night that hasn't been 25 years, but it's important steps we do.
"In all these difficulties we also need the support of society, and this support can only come if we demonstrate that we are doing our duty, that these young people have a chance and do not pose a threat to society," Cazanciuc said.
The Ministry of Justice has succeeded both students and educators, showing that success comes only through the combined efforts of everyone.
"And because today is the celebration of the Highness of the Holy Cross, I would invite all the students and teachers to visit the Masols from Sweden, Marašti and not only to understand what it means to fight young people for ideals," said Robert Cazancious.
A Russian came to vote with the mouse
Doctoral schools with two plagiarized schools are downgraded!
Request for university graduates from Iaşi and the country
Over 200 researchers, universities, personalities and students from the country signed a petition from the Academy Society in Romania requesting the Ministry of Education and Research to assess, punish and even discourage medical schools in Romania "which allows and promotes academic taxation".
The signatories of the petition launched on 10 September shall also include academics and teachers from Iaşi.
Through the university signatories of the foreign academic environment, it is, for example, Prof. Livius Antonesei.
At the national level, the petition has names from foreign ministers of education, such as Mircea Miklea, people of culture who are and academics, such as Andrei Pleșu, Aurora Liceanu or Alina Mungiu-Pippidi.
"Although the Education Law provides for the evaluation of doctoral schools, this fact has not been carried out so far as to determine the lack of specific sanctions for doctoral schools that flaunt the ethical rules of scientific research and do not produce relevant and internationally recognised performance," states the initiative.
The request specifically calls for compliance with the National Education Act, the assessment of doctoral schools, suspension of the right to function for any doctoral school in which more than two complaints have been found, until the assessment and correction of the situation.
The last requirement is to suspend the right to function for any doctoral school where there is no minimum number of doctoral drivers provided for by law to meet the criteria imposed by the National Research Council in 2011 for the eligibility of IDEI project grants.
Do you respect less a general without a doctor, or a politician, or an informant in the Middle East?
"Why is there no other colleges in Europe that will provide doctors organized by secret services, and senior soldiers who give their doctor a doctor do it to autonomous academic institutions, where quality is verified by the academic environment?" said Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, president of the Romanian Academy of Sciences, the founder of the petition, and she of Yaşi.
This can be completed by all the wishes on the Society's website, and the final signatures will be sent by organisation to the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research.
We're not looking for 3 people with money, but 10,000 who want to get involved.
The "Pentru Iaşi" party, founded by young political non-governmental IT managers, was launched alternates in the Copou Park.
The President of the "Pentru Iaşi" Initiative Group gave an interview "The Iron of Iaşi"
Yašu will have a party dedicated exclusively to the development of the city.
A group of politically unaffiliated entrepreneurs and managers has so far launched at the end of the week of the Party for Iaji, which will propose candidates for local elections in 2016.
At present, the party's core is a form of IT specialists, but the training initiatives say that in the organisation are welcome to all people who want to involve themselves in modernising the city.
The launch took place on Saturday in Copou Park, and the event involved over 200 sympathetic people, almost all being young.
The special invitation to the action was Nicoşor Dan, president of the Association Save the Bucharest.
He was surprised at the 2012 local elections when, as independent, he was able to raise 10% of the votes of the winners for the capital's primary role.
"The people I've seen at "The Bridge of Iaşi" think they're very good to access the public administration of Iaş".
I believe in this initiative, I think there are chances, I think there may be more chances in a community than in Bucharest.
"You'll always be next to "Pentru Iaşi," said nicuszor Dan.
ZDI: Why didn't you leave Yaşi to work in an IT foreign company?
Andrei Postolache: The reasons are more emotional and emotional.
I've been away on many short business trips, I've been living in Cluj for a year.
I've come back every time, because I feel like this is my house.
ZDI: Why did you now decide to create a political party?
Andrei Postolache: Now we have reached a certain maturity, we are a group of people who have started to know us for a while.
We met in professional contexts, we started discussing how we could be involved.
At first, we were more concerned, in smaller things, with projects at NGOs, with various practical or charitable actions, and, in some cases, things have evolved natural and organic and now it has become the moment we reached the decision that we must involve more than that.
ZDI: Name three specific projects to enhance the activity of local public administration!
Andrei Postolache: The first project consists of a minimum informing of the primary activity so that different departments, institutions and regions cooperate as best as possible.
But more importantly, we can publish transparent data on the activities outlined in detail: bugs, reports, projects, etc. We are talking about information organisation.
The second would be transparency because this leads to efficiency.
If you have a project in a particular folder, it is important to consult people affected.
If we speak efficiently, we don't have to forget transport in general, we have the worst buses in the country.
You need to buy new means of transport.
ZDI: Today, the image of a city is very much.
How did you promote Iaş?
Andrei Postolache: You're on the plane and you're looking for investors in this world.
There are conferences, industrial events in which you can "sell" the city.
You must want to do this and know to do it.
And here we have an advantage: we come from business and we brought customers to Yashii.
ZDI: What is the brand of Iaş?
Andrei Postolache: My idea is that we have to be a city of technology in one way or the other.
We already have the IT industry and we have to expand it, go to medicine, enter the robotic area, in 3D printing, continue in this spirit and join such elements.
I think the brand should be in the science area, I'm referring here to the modern brand of the city.
Of course, Yaşu already has a historical brand that must not be changed, that is, cultural cities.
I see the two elements in balance: culture and technology.
ZDI: How will you compensate for the lack of experience in public administration, as well as the lack of traditional party structures that still win elections in Romania?
Andrei Postolache: Administration is a form of management, which means organizing, planning, communicating, working with people and projecting.
We have experience in management.
We don't want traditional structures, we don't care.
We want to involve people, we're going to talk to everyone, we're not just on Facebook, we're not online.
We don't want to have volunteers brought with the bus.
That means we're based on people who really want to get involved and help, and we think there's enough people like this.
ZDI: The Prime Minister should be more concerned about promoting the image of the city at national and international level, or is it necessary that the area of concern remain functional?
Andrei Postolache: One without another does not work.
First of all, you have to solve today's problems, emergencies.
Or, if you don't make the city you know, if you don't throw money into town, at a time you'll stay out of money and you won't be able to do, for example, strike.
You have to do both at the same time and you have to be competent people.
The primer doesn't have to do everything.
We have to give up the primary-tau model, which comes and beats with dust in the mass and solves everything.
No, no, no.
We're a team.
The first is the coordinator of a orchestra.
ZDI: Will you try to attract business people in the IT area who can support the party financially?
Andrei Postolache: We are looking for people who want to do something good, to have an unbridled reputation, to be clear integrity and to be honorable.
From this point of view, we have no other filters.
We're not looking for three people with money, we're looking for 10,000 people, or why not, 300,000, who want to get involved and do something for the city.
Interview by Alex ANDREI
Andrei Postolache works in the IT industry for almost 15 years.
In July 2015, Introspecials was established, after seven years he was the director of the International Group of Endava (2008 - 2015), where he co-ordinated a team of 300 people.
Other four years (2003 - 2007) spent it at Syngy.
The company which established it with another IT specialist provides management consulting services.
The Rabla process for processing has failed
The Director-General of the SC IRUS SA Reghin, Mircea Oltean, said that the Programme of Promotion of the National Park of tractors and Agricultural Cars, launched in 2011, named and Rabla for tractors, was a failure due to bureaucracy.
As regards the Rapla programme, there have been some attempts in recent years, but it proved to be a mistake, because the documentation was very workable and complicated for a rural farmer, and the approvals were too long and then the world gave up.
That program managed to sell somewhere to 10 pieces.
"The need for treatment for Romanian agriculture would be 300,000 cows," said Mircea Oltean.
According to it, IRUM Reghin is the only company that produces hundreds of annual treatments, being the largest in Romania, and that big competition is exercised by foreign companies, who know the needs of the Romanian market.
It's a very big competition with those who come out, all the world's producers have seen Romania, I know these things I told you, and they have special policies.
"All markets are large agglomeration, all exposed producers, come with all sorts of variants," said Mircea Oltean, who pointed out that IRUM Reghin produces annually around 500 agricultural and forestry tractors.
Through the Rabla treatment programme, initiated in 2011, those who owned old and other self-propelled treatments, such as the combinations, could take over and received a valuable 17,000-year-old ticket.
The red dragon has been raised
The interior sculpture of workers seems more spectacular and more significant political, as the new elected leader becomes automatically running his career in the future elections.
You grow up, so, the red-aprins/ Under his scars we will live and die.
That's what he sang last night, Jeremy Corbyn in the London People's Sanctuary House.
She witnessed a lot of facts and assurances/ Let's not change her color now.
Readers who do not know the melodic line of this non-official British and international flag (The Red Flag) can search the Internet and would not be excluded from having a surprise.
With the heads discovered, let's all swear that we'll wear it until we get out of here.
The author of these terms is not only an admirer of the red bars (and not of those flying them), but he respects the democratic political traditions that are built around them.
If Jeremy Corbyn is gonna be able to hit the left with tomorrow, this story of love between him and the Base of the Laburist Party will be part of a happy-end.
I don't think this will happen, but I think it's too late to talk about the sea and the inevitable electrical collapse, over five years, of a choice alternative leader.
Now, however, we can refer to procedures: we have attended a democratic exercise of an impressive cover.
The British labyrinths have invented the system of direct vote for the leader of the party, along the west coast.
French socialists have been working for several years on a more complex system, based on motivations, which allows all members and sympathy; in addition, they have organised a preliminary competition for appointment of the candidate to the presidentials in 2012.
However, the internal survey of workers seems more spectacular and more significant political, as the new election leader becomes automatically its career in the future elections.
It is, of course, and a matter of political system, the personalisation of power is more pronounced in the British Sea than in the other part of the Canal of Manecia.
In addition, the participation in the vote was great in all three "searches": self-employed members, union members and other party-related organisations, and finally the group of sympathy (which received the ballot paper after a summary registration procedure).
This last group provides us with interesting information on the perceptions of left-wing segments of British society, especially those formed by young people or middle-aged, educated, interested in political phenomenon.
Many of them will choose to become involved and more, in the future, just because of the signal offered by Corbyn's victory.
There's no way, I know, sociological research to tell us too much about the attitudes of this laburist's "external search", so careful speculation is allowed.
I think we meet some similar attitudes to those of the Podemos (Spain) or even SYRIZA (Greece), with the observation that they will cross the traditional channels of the left.
If we have to identify a "antisystem" call, it is primarily reflected by the rejection of the centralist line, New Labour (for many, only a dissimulated form of thatcherism).
The second component would be the review of the leaders considered guilty of the two subsequent electoral errors, one of the arguments being that they did not go to the left, that they did not severely limit Tony Blair's time.
The second reper - after me, and more suggestive - is offered by the recent referendum on the independence of Scotland.
If we extract the separatist message and concentrate strictly on the aspirations of other political topics, we see how Scottish nationalists have captured the energy of favourable public segments of the social state and stimulated by the aspirations of equity, adaptive disarmament and the host of military involvement on the streets, but always sensitive to new foreign issues: ecology, gene, assistance for poor countries.
The Scottish workers thus lost a electorate who should have, at least in principle, a privileged access, but who can now recover it (see their enthusiasm towards Corbyn's campaign).
The same energy exists all over the United Kingdom, but the old leadership could not attract them.
Jeremy Corbyn, with his voice outsider, has more chances of success than Ed Miliband, "aristocrat" laburist.
The comparison with Scotland tells us more, I believe, rather than the left-hand anti-system from the southern European peripheral.
The "antisystem" term is too hard: "anti-establishment" seems more appropriate to me.
By next week, we'll find out more about Jeremy Corbyn's first steps, as the leader of the opposition.
We'll see if there's any red Steagul will also be raised in the House of Commons (it wouldn't be for the first time), after the new leader will be occupied, first by the opposition banks.
Anyway, what Jeremy Corbyn wants now from his fellow Members of Parliament is in the first place - and in this regard he has reason to be concerned.
Capcan of manipulation with or without knowledge
While I wrote the article, I went through the head to check online the story of the former warrior and "commandant Syrian Laith Al-Saleh" became part of the second space dedicated by V. Marin his person's "Laith Al-Saleh Jihadist" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could themselves make me a circus.
I didn't.
In last week's article (Europe, between refugees and "refugees") I commented in the parallel two poems - the one with the boy Aylan Kurdi found dead on the shore of the Mediterranean and the one, in fact: the two doing it on the Syrian Laith Al-Saleh once as a warrior, the second time as a refugee.
The story with Laith Al-Saleh was taken from the article "Serien warriors came with the valley of refugees" (sanned by Viorica Marin in the Truth of September 3rd).
Last night, I put a link to my article on my Facebook page.
Tuesday, entering Facebook, I found, among other things, a piece of bread by the friend (not only by the FB) Marius Cristian: "Subscribe, rather than a clarification. Laith of Saleh is not a Jewadist".
On the contrary, he's Al Assad's opponent, for democracy and that one.
"So that you could add the grossolone to the table"!
I have to admit, I felt ashamed.
The more I wrote the article, the more I went through my head to check online the story of the former warrior and "the Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" became part of the second part of the space dedicated by V. Marin his people's "Leith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could themselves make me a circus.
Because I had faith in the truth, in his journals.
On the contrary, I had no comment on the drawing of food from Marius Cristian than, "I should have believed in the Truth."
After that, I obviously took the money off the record and I feel indebted to readers with the correct presentation of the Syrian story Laith Al-Saleh.
The oldest I found it in an Associated Press (Syrian rebel leader sex Europe - Syrian rebel leader seeking Europe) signed by Nicholas Baphititis and Dalton Bennett of 17 August 2015 on the island of Kos in Greece, where they noted, among the hundreds, thousands of refugees, a man trying to order in the chaos of the crowd.
The man was Syrian poet Laith Al Saleh of Aleppo who "is used to be at the command", since "he led a unit of 700 rebels in the civil war in Syria".
We also find that Al Saleh, aged 30, warned "a house, a wife and a normal life before the battle began that cost more than 250,000 lives and placed a third of the Syrian population on the streets."
In the interview given by the Associated Press, Al Saleh says "all people want to leave Syria".
My city is the most dangerous city in the world.
About 70 percent of the city is destroyed.
In Syria, Al Qaeda wants me, Daesh (a extremist group of Islamic states), the government wants me to fight against everyone.
Instead of being thrown out of a supermarket on the island, Kos would have offered him "a meeting and closer - with a man in whom he recognized a Syrian enemy": "Two days ago, I saw a lunetist from government forces."
I didn't talk to him, but I'm still very angry.
From the material we find that Laith (which means leu in Arabic) was, in fact, on the way to the Netherlands, where he had a truth - he was superior to the Syrian army and then became a rebel and he arrived in the West after he was seriously injured - hoping to get asylum and can bring his family and his wife and a three-year-old boy (nearly old with the civil war in Syria, which started in March 2011).
After this, Laith Al-Saleh would not have excluded a return to Syria to continue the fight for the Syrian Free Army (supported by the West) - against the three forces: the army of President Bashar Assad (supported by Russian), the Islamic State and the Nusra Front, affiliated with Al-Qaeda.
A fool - who wants freedom must fight in Syria, not one enemy alone, but three!
I gave more than a Serbian material on 22 August, of which I do not understand much, only that Laith Al Saleh is associated with terrorists who come together with migrants: TERROISTS SINGLE WITH MIGRANTIMA is the title of a news from http://www.tegraph.r/ves, in which they are added a post with Al Saleh with a barbara holding a Syrian flag in their hand and that of the fugitive who carries the trick with "THANK YU".
On September 7, then, on the BBC website, Mike Wendling drew attention to the case of manipulation with the help of the Syrian fighter's ponies: This viral photo fake claims to show an IS fighter as a refugee - This viral post wrongly claims to create a fighter of the Islamic State who is able to flee.
We find that the poem (in fact, the poems - the Laith with bar and gun and the THANK YOU triangle) was written by a user on Facebook, who would have been and would have asked for forgiveness between time.
Only before that, just on his walls, the picture with the two pictures would have been painted over 70,000 times, adding a few thousand comments.
That's what he's talking about, too late, the horse goes away!
In Romania, on September 9, Carla Dino from Hotnews took over the story with the manipulation of BBC, but erroneously translated the title: "A fake photo became a viral show of an ISIS fighter being violated by refugee rights."
Obviously, not the photograph is false, but interpretation was a false, wrong, short: manipulation.

"The positive reaction of the Federation's pilots and officials makes me hope that we will also be campaigning in this year," the railway manager Dan Codreanu said.
