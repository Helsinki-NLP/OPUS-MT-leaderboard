Good: More safety for foot-and-mouthers
They are not 100 metres away from each other: On Tuesday, the new B 33 foot walkway was taken into operation at the village park site - in view of the older Rathauampel.
Two installations so close to each other: intention or civil society?
This question was answered yesterday by Gutachs Mayor.
"The Rathauampel has been installed at the time because it secures the school path," explained Eckert yesterday.
The cluster appel secures both trainers and bus guests and the mountain dwellers.
The facility officially adopted yesterday is important for the cross-section of Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, body park, bus stop, a doctor and a bank, as well as the traffic flow from the dwelling area ‹Grub ́.
"When the high traffic and pedestrians arrived, their safety had to be further shaken here," Eckert said.
This is confirmed by Peter Arnold from the Landrassamt Offenburg.
"According to current measurements of the B 33 every day, about 12,000 vehicles are the municipality of Gutach, of which about 10 percent are heavy load traffic," said Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of a further appel is more than necessary: "Security is simply going ahead here," says Arnold.
In total, four road visits were carried out, and a cross-road traffic was envisaged, but the crossing of Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße was reopened because of the gangs in the cross section.
According to Arnold, at the location selection of the Ampelmasters, we were first tested: "We have been tested by an extra for us with a particularly long wood-loaded transporter, whether we can drive these vehicles out of the Sulzbach road to the B 33 without interrupting the Ampelmasters".
The around 15 000 Euro of your Appellate Facility itself is the "modernest present on the market", explained Arnold.
The installation is equipped with colourful LEDs that shine so strongly that the lights from the car drivers are also well-known in deep-sea suns.
And it's also sharp: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new one just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per drive.
Arnold explained the technology of the new facility: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
Pressing the button, the top radar sensor will test the traffic beams.
If the road is free, immediately green will come for the footsteppers, if not, it will take about 15 seconds.
A further radar sensor tests whether the grünphase for the foot can be completed.
"If a group or a group of people are going on the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone is sure about the train," Arnold explained.
Of course, the car driver should think here as a partner and watch the train.
This was not the case yesterday: rarely showed the bell for footsteppers green, an over-class vehicle rolled - at bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul for more than 30 years.
The catastrophes of his Catholic villagelessness - the languagelessness, the addiction to pure violence and stupid sexuality, the hatred and unhappiness - have often been described by the Karntner Dichter.
The booker priest is known primarily as a processor, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher presents for his performance "Superlights on the songpiece", which is now seen in the garage X at Petersplace, so a collage from prosatexts together.
The Theatermaker connects some elements from the autobiographical novel "The Body" (1987) with prosaminations from "Leichnam, his family owes" (2003).
On the widely taught stage - important requisit: a sculpted sofa, in which it is copied and masturbated - the eight-pound collection is covered by the text material.
In this case, the editor of Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance transmits the presentation with a full set of government attacks, known from the repertoire of postdramatic games.
In particular, the players come in the midst of some questionable Chinese translations.
They are hard-covered, covered with the head under water, covered with their abends on the wall.
Indignant in Zellophan or Mieder, they stick on dangerous high pillars by insinating, either monologizing loud or lying completely buried on the ground floor.
However, the text does not reveal itself in this strict manner.
The best moments are at night when you are sleeping - the band width ranges from Deep Purple to the most popular song.
Only against the end comes the surprise performance comes to something calm, and Winkler's sudden absurd humor turns up.
A black box in the car?
U.S. street planners are looking for a source of money to repair the crashing highway system and believe that the solution is found in a small black box, which is located in the armature board of each car.
The devices that record each dangerous mile and report the information to the authorities are the core of a controversial attempt by Washington and the federal planning offices to review the old system to finance US roads.
The more generally long-term road planning area has suddenly created an intense debate with beautiful alliances.
Libertaire has joined environmental groups and speaks of the government being able to use the small boxes to record the dangerous kilometers – and possibly even where they were threatened – and then the information can be used for the calculation of tax decisions.
The Tea Party is late.
The American Civil Law Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and raises a number of data protection concerns.
However, while some cannot attend a convention, several federal states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can change to a system in the next ten years to pay the driver for dangerous mail.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the drivers, some of whom are equipped with GPS surveillance.
This is really a must for our country.
“It’s nothing that we can only use," said Hassan Ikhrata, the manager of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, who has been planning a list of the dangerous miles in all California motorists in the state since 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, financed from the taxes that the US-Americans enter into the Zapfsal is suffering.
But in America, it's no longer thought of as much as before.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The State mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallone (less than 4 Eurocent per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not use high-priced taxes to limit taxes to just one cent.
"The gas tax is simply not possible for the future," said Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic law at the University of Minnesota.
Its state has recently equipped 500 cars with driver's licenses, with which a melancholy-based payment system should be tested.
"This represents the most long-term alternative," he said.
The bureaucrats refer to it as a mail-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is found in urban liberal attacks, as taxes, for example, have been used to influence driving behaviour so as to reduce noise and greenhouse gases.
The California Planners will focus on the system for the development of strategies with which the legitimate objectives of the Federal State are to be achieved for climate change.
However, the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transport Committee, has also stated that he sees the long-term alternatives.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also inspired by the idea to allow drivers to pay for their returns.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice-President for Guidelines at Reason.
People pay for what they get.
The movement will also be supported by two former US transport ministers who had called on the Congress in 2011 in a report to move towards a mid-based settlement.
The U.S. Senate approved a 90 million-dollar pilot project that included 10,000 cars last year.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the president and responded to the concerns of members of rural areas, the people who often had to return many miles on the road to work or to the city.
A number of federal and large cities are not moving on their own foot in this direction.
The most committed is Oregon, which currently kills 5,000 drivers for the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon be paid the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the Federal State.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also looks like this.
Illinois tests it in a limited way with Lkws.
And the I-95 coalition, which is part of the Federal Ministry of Transport of 17 countries at the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently examining how to introduce the change.
The concept is not universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, auto drivers were skeptical about thinking that the government could track any of their movements.
“Thinking against Big Brother and such things was a big problem,” explains Alauddin Khan, Head of the Strategy and Results Management in Nevada’s Ministry of Transport.
People didn't want it.
When the test was carried out, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the driver into advanced monitoring devices."
There is no need to build a giant, sophisticated technological infrastructure that would be used without being used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is part of a number of federal states that now hold on to the review of flexible technology, with which the state can determine the dangerous kilometers, but not exactly where and where.
So, Khan, the public would also be more relaxed.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company named True Mileage in California.
The company is not originally involved in helping the federal authorities in the control of motor vehicles.
More than that, it was her goal to be caught in a emerging market for Kfz insurance feet where the driver should pay on the basis of the dangerous mileage.
However, the devices tested by them are also interesting for the road planners, as they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
“People are more willing to participate when their speed and locations are not recorded,” stated Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programmes have made a big mistake.
There are significantly cheaper and less intrusive possibilities to implement this.
In Oregon, the planner experimentes to give car drivers a range of options.
You can decide for a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose any device and instead pay a pause fee on the basis of the average mileage of all citizens of the Federal State.
Other bodies hope to be able to sell the concept of a mysterious public by equiping the devices with more functions than with less.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a control device that allows them to pay parking fees, to pay insurance only for dangerous mileages, and to collect speed data from other vehicles in real time thanks to the driver's stay.
"A car drivers would be motivated by the majority of the benefits offered by the system," it is said in a city planning document.
Some traffic planners, however, wonder whether the whole range of payments per mile is not just a huge divergence.
At the Metropolitan Transport Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, the Congress could solve the problem of the Highway Trust Fund by simply increasing fuel taxes.
An additional single fee or an annual fee may be charged to motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume less gasoline, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is also sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission's Head of Law and Public Affairs.
When we do this, hundreds of millions of car drivers take care of their privacy and many other things.
King's Field: Little Man Flysing Wakes Up
The volunteer firefighter handled her headhead test despite staff deficiencies with Bravour.
Only 11 men participated in the exercise.
The department's commander, Hans Kammerer, had examined the presence of Feder in the Burgberger Street in his exercise.
There's supposed to be a short closure at the beach.
Two people were injured by the existing fire and the development of smoking, but one of them was able to send another emergency.
After the first inspection of the case by Hans Kammerer, two air defence officers of the Wehr were ready to take part in the building.
After a short time it was possible to find the first person and lead to freedom.
The second person had to be taken.
This was not as easy as it was to overcome a little bit too.
The building, a workshop with an integrated stand for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There were lots of wood and also electric ballboards.
Further, there were electrical machinery for wood processing.
The first solution hit the tank in the vehicle.
A further direction was made over a superfluorous hydrant in about 100 meters away.
Three solutions could now be designed.
There was also a wooden beam in the building.
His chamberer also went on to show what is to be done with little staff available.
In the event of a serious accident, support is being given to the Königsfeld Day Implementation Group.
The commander was satisfied with the performance of the exercises.
Networking of universities and companies is important
On his visit to the rural district of Breisgau-Hochwarzwald, Landday President Guido Wolf also made it clear in Titissee-Nestadt, where the labour force comes from tomorrow.
In the centre of the promotional centre of Hochschwarzwald, he went along with the business leaders of the vocational schools, the kreisgymnasium and the parentheses of this important issue.
"Education is an important location factor," Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma School, representing the network of education centres Highwarwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful collaboration between the promotion centre, the kreisgymnasium and the vocational centre.
He also praised the family welfare in the countryside.
"It is important not only to have the family phase in mind, but also because of the demographic change, the phase for the care of members," said Wolf.
He also pointed out that he was increasingly concerned about the care and care of his family.
"Without the support of the employer, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the working relationship," said Wolf.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
A further, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and businesses.
"Because he has already known the advantages of the region during his studies, he often receives his acquired knowledge and skills from the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," said the president of the country.
Because only if adequate training sites are offered, the need for expertise can also be met.
In his view, the local advantage of the landscape is its advantage in the south-west Germany, in immediate proximity to France and Switzerland.
He also experienced the efforts already under way to develop public transport.
"Continue to be generous and make sure that public transport will improve," he explained to the address of the existing municipal policy.
With music, you will experience a long afternoon
For 15 years the Kaul family has been inviting the Dieting Elders to coffee, cook and then to a Vesper.
In the past, the older citizens were assessed in the orphanage.
In the meantime, this afternoon is located in the Pflegeheim St. Josef.
The inhabitants enjoy the delicious kitchens and taverns.
Then there was Wurstsalat.
Silvia Kimmich bandle and her father, Karl Kimmich, met with ordinary melody.
Over 100 years of old natural stone walls, as a further limitation of the old halls in pre-canning, to the church street, are to be reimbursed at the cost of the city of Brünningen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small corner wall, stabilized and static discharge of the natural wall with balustrade was built during the first work of the previous school.
The next stage is that Alexander Misok of the Brüunling City Building, the Landsdenmålämältt, join the plans and create a healing concept for the old walls.
A cost calculation should then be carried out by experts, which should then be placed on the table for the decision and for the determination of the next procedure.
A decision on this will be expected to take place in the coming year.
After cleaning, planting and planting the old school hall within the two side planes of the school built in 1912, it must be followed in a timely manner as a result of the necessary restrictions on sanitation on grounds and on new construction.
The historical, one hundred years old demarcation wall of the old school on the church street is mainly caused by water and frost damage, because there is no draining, need for healing and has a backbone.
Deep roses in individual rocks testify to weather damage, but the wall is not currently threatened.
A stable wall is a condition for one of the students to use the school hall, which is carried out by the current construction work.
It was originally planned even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditure resulted in a decline.
An important word in the historical school-mural planning, which has even been used for film receptions, will be spoken by the country's parliament.
If standards come from this page, then the city hopes the Brüunlings to be provided by the memory defenders.
Students of the Brünling Primary School, who are taught in a well-known old school building with new Aula, can soon use the old school.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
In the ongoing discussions on the future of the music schools in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, Federal President of the Greens, has also been activated.
"I thought it was wrong to give the entire school of music in Stuttgart," Özdemir said the "Stutgar news".
Jazz and Classic are just at the site of Jazztgart.
Thus Özdemir, who is in Stuttgart as a favorite for a direct mandate at the Bundestag elections on 22 September, is opposed to the Green-Rott Government.
This strengthens the reorganization of the five music schools in Baden-Württemberg on the basis of an expert study.
Then, among other things, Jazz and Pop should be transferred from the Stuttgart Music School to the Mannheim Music School.
US border: "Super tunnel" detected for drug use
At the border between Mexico and the United States, detectors discovered a "super-tunnel" for drug abuse.
As the U.S. customs authorities reported, more than 500 metres of rail between Tijuana and San Diego were equipped with electricity, railing and a heating plant.
Three suspects were therefore arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine.
The tunnel was not used as a result.
"These maps are stupid, if they think they could cross the radar," said the U.S. state attorney General of Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in San Diego, a warehouse in which an end of the tunnel was discovered.
Duffy used the drug gangs: "If you build and try to use such a tunnel, we are determined to make a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a long fight against drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Designed by experts
Because of the continuous equipment of the tunnel, the detectors assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took place about a year ago.
The installation was equipped so that electric vehicles could be used there.
On the Mexican side is access to a building which is 80 metres away from the border.
According to the authorities, a leader leads 20 meters deep into the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1,20 meters high and 90 cm wide.
It would also be appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two suspects were found in connection with the cocaine finding.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested because of the accused Marihuanas.
All three claim to be the highest penalty of life-long freedom, as officials have said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it has continued at the press conference in San Diego.
But it was the first time that was found in such a tunnel building cocaine.
Normally cocaine is mixed in smaller quantities and not mixed with tunnels.
This shows the "disquieting" of drug gangs whose traditional routes have been cut off, Bill Sherman said from the DEA drug seizure in San Diego.
They'd do everything they could to get to the United States.
No details were known for the arrests, at least one of the Mexicans, had it.
They have to be sentenced to ten years.
2014 will be passed year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen at 1250.
Repeating the first organic reference is becoming ever closer.
If the year is to end in good eight weeks, the anniversary will end.
Geisingen and Church Houses were first mentioned in order to meet the needs of 794 church houses.
In the church, an auction was made in which both places are mentioned.
On 15 March it was to be given an official record for the Jubilee year, and since there are no halls, this event will take place in the place where it was first mentioned two years ago in the Church Houses.
Within the framework of the Jubilee, various events are planned both in Gesingen and in Church Houses.
Church houses will be held on a weekend from 18 to 20 July 1250 in July.
Celebrate again.
On Friday with a party, Saturday and Sunday with a party around the church hall.
This weekend is also the church-houser church festival.
The city music director Rudolf Barth wrote for the city at the time of the Jubilee a statement of order which will be given in three terms.
On 21 June, together with the Sunday festival of the Black Zaldver, on 12 July in the Arena with firework and on 13 December as the first concert of the city music in the new Festival.
This will be completed and extended in the Jubilee year, the official term is last September, on 27 and 28 September.
At the time of the Gesinger City Jubilám, a new Chronicles will also be issued.
"But it should be a chronic not only of gesing itself, but of a printed work on the gesing of today, which is also made up of gesingen, church houses, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And also the gesing of today celebrates birthday 2014, 1974 the present room was filled with the receptions.
The new Chronicles will then be presented at the new Festival on 21 or 22 November.
2014 is also another year with many jubilees.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki begins on 8 February with a wearer of her 60-year-old possession, the harmony of Gutmaningen will be 90 years old, and on 29 March it will celebrate the festival and celebrates the district music from 1 to 4 May.
The Oldwerk Leipferdingen will be 40 years old, the Gesinger School has been in the new location for 50 years, and this will be celebrated on May 10th, the band of Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will be 150 years old and will celebrate it in the framework of the Brunnn Festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a research survey conducted in the possession of the monastery of St. Gallen in 764.
The case was made in church (houses), which was then a court seat.
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same order.
In 2014 this 1250-year-old celebrates, in addition to the 40-year common form.

Whether the "Am Hirsch" track should be automatically restructured to increase traffic safety
Yes, they have decided to have the community meetings.
Schiltach must take €220,000 for it.
The German Railway wants to improve the Kinzigtal Railways in the coming year.
In particular, the safety of railway crossings should be increased - it is regularly bound to collisions of trains with other vehicles.
In order for the communities to take the construction measures, they must participate with a third party in the cost of sharing the rest of the railway and bond.
Schiltachs Townhouseister Roland Grißehaber explained to the council the details of the "Am Hirschen".
There the city is planning to build an outlet at the height of the nearby tunnel in the west of the railway station.
There could also be larger vehicles, for example, such as long-distance vehicles, when travelling without having to block the glasses.
The owner therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall so that the city could extend the next road for a time to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was discussed in the House dispute, since some of the wheels pointed to the need for street distribution in doubt: Thomas Kipp, with his remarks, brought the criticism of the critics to the point: "Do we have to take so much money because of such few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas protested: The "Hirschen" train pass will be used regularly for longholz transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area will be transported partly over this route, because the vehicles could not use the route on the Haberles bridge, because they could not go to the main road there.
In addition, the tracks served as a guide for those vehicles that should not use the tunnel if the main road is closed, argumented haas.
In view of the fact that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels have to be built and repaired, as in Wolfach the case is at present, the "The "Hirschen" can also have an important meaning for a longer period of transport.
The lines agreed to allow for an examination of the costs that would result from the expected expansion of the road.
In spite of this, the construction of the railway has been largely in line with the measure that the necessary support wall is built so that the city can be built on the next road to the "road of the railway", where appropriate, for meeting traffic at about 5.5 metres.
However, the construction of the railway crossing at the Gerrei Trautwin could pose a completely different problem that concerns access to the rising "Gerolthouse Road".
The administration would have examined the construction plans of the railway from the Engineering Office Breinlinger, since it had doubts as to whether the planned connection to the Gerolthouse Road was still possible.
The investigation led to the conclusion that it should not be excluded that the road’s weather conditions could lead to a longer stopover of vehicles.
The responsibility for this was once again the city as a street transporter.
The construction could therefore be followed by debt disputes.
Since both wood transport and the area of the current state of development were functioning, one should not agree to the construction of the railway crossing, as argued by Haas.
Also at this point, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the passage is significantly lower than that of the other railway crossings, because there is a direct link between the centre of the train.
Even trainers from the main train station had to be in this position as far as it's broken, that no collision is going to take place.
In most cases, the construction of this railway has been refused, since Schiltach had to "remove" the problem with existing vehicles, so the wheels could withdraw after the completion of the construction work.
The Panel considers the constructions of the railways "For Heubach" and "For Kuhbach" for the already cross-border agreements with the train.
Esa decides on major world-wide missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravity waves or black holes - European Space Agency experts now need to focus on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals stand for selection, five are still running.
Remote worlds.
More than 1,000 planets have already been found by other stars.
If there are at least some of them alive, no one knows.
The selection is difficult: Should you search for gravity cells?
Or would you like to investigate the origin of the cosmos?
Or are you looking for a mindless planet and perhaps discovering an extraterrestrial life?
These questions are directly addressed by the European Space Agency Esa.
For her program "Cosmic Vision" they are looking for ideas for two large space projects that should make research decisive.
The Etat for such "L-missions" is approximately EUR billion each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elite of European Space Research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 Idea stood for debate, five of them have now come into the worst choice.
A number of groups were looking forward to the proposals, looking forward to research.
In the next few days, a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
In total, four big questions have been selected by Esa, on which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme launched in 2007.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The exact steps in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets that surround these stars - are still in the verbal dark.
A large infrared telescope in all could pass this dark.
And if a star has planets, under what conditions can life arise there?
To address this question, 2017 will begin the World Space Telescope "Cheeps", with the 500 well-known planet systems being examined more closely in our immediate environment.
However, the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.
With larger instruments, the astronomers could design mindful planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and thus search for "biomarks": gases that serve as an indicator for biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question should also be finalised on what conditions exist for the creation of life.
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field with the planet's system.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined in an exemplary manner.
With the Solar Orbiter, Esa has already approved a M-class mission (where the budget is at about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The sun is to start in 2017 and monitor the surface and activity of the sun.
The researchers are also very interested in Jupiter and its coins.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, the Esa is the first of the three L missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme.
The "Juice" probe (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later she will reach Jupiter and will explore the atmosphere of the planet as well as the distant moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The world offers many opportunities to study material under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also differences that could show the physicists the way to a new theory, under which all known laws unite.
How did the universe come into existence and why does it exist?
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos was created by the Orknal.
In addition to the material we believe, from the stars, planets and living beings as we exist, there is dark matter that combines the gravity of galaxies and galaxies, and dark energy, which accelerates the expansion of the world.
Until then, researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first part of the urchinal, where dark matter and dark energy existed.
With "Euclid" the Esa has already granted a M mission, which is scheduled to start for 2020.
With a special telescope, the sin is to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the universe and thus enable the creation of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race?
Only two of the 30 proposals remain at the end of the selection procedure.
The best chances of a permit as a L-mission have, according to many experts, "E-Lisa", a demanding concept of proof of gravity.
These include physical changes in the structure of space time, which Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They were not reported until today.
Elisa could create it, the scientists hope for the project.
The mission sees an existing detector of two or three suns that will be stationed in all.
In contrast to plants on earth, it could also show gravity waves that have occurred at the urknal, providing new insights about the formation of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still to compete on the second L-mission: a large range telescope named "Athena", which is to explore among other black holes, "Icy Planets", a further mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "prism", a mission to reduce the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", to explore and investigate the imaginary planets.
They are already scattered, among other things, for the sample transport from March, for the research of moons, Venus and asteroids, and for the sun physics.
Snowden is ready to "copy" with Germany with regard to US surveillance
Edward Snowden, who was the secretary of the U.S. Secret Service, said he was ready to travel to Berlin and speak before the German Federal Day when the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander had no answers to their activities.
The German Chancellor Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received this asylum to discuss the statement with him in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented on Friday in Berlin to the media, he wrote: “Even if the outcome of my efforts was positive, my Government continues to treat a different opinion as a fraud and tries to criminalize political opinion with punishment, where no defence is possible."
But the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden wrote that he was convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to let the charges against him fall.
The charges raised by the US Ministry of Justice include spying and theft of State property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said about the time online: "If Mr Snowden is willing to speak with German representatives, we will find ways to do so."
The relationship between the United States and Germany is affected by the allegations that the NSA has heard the phone from Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the honourable Member of the Parliamentary Committee responsible for the Secret Service, explained that it would be possible to take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness if that is possible, "without threatening him and completely destroying relations with the United States".
Ströbele, a Greens MP, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbel stated that according to the lawyer of the former NSA worker Snowden, he could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden is present in Germany, he needs a guarantee that he is safe there, as the honourable Member said.
Snowden explains in his letter that he was exposed to a “repressive and ongoing” persecution campaign that had expelled him from his home.
However, he has been affected by the global response to "my Act of Political Opinion".
Citizens around the world as well as high-ranking politicians – even in the United States – have referred the findings to an uncontrollable surveillance system as a public service.
In his letter, Snowden offered the German authorities cooperation, “when difficulties have been solved around the humanitarian situation”.
Frontier Airlines charges for handpacks
Frontier Airlines is planning to demand up to $100 of passengers who want to sell handbags on their flight.
Frontier Airlines aims to calculate up to $100 for a piece of handbag and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even if it was to read in the announcement Wednesday that passengers should keep the whole dose.
The new fee applies to handbags in the package over the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier explained that it was estimated that 25 US dollars would be paid in advance, and 100 US dollars for passengers who paid only on the flight path.
Frontier speaker Kate O'Malley said that the fee of 100 US dollars was intended to move traveling to take care of the payment in advance.
"We do not want to calculate this sum," she explained.
Flight companies started in 2008 to apply for the first and second prescribed package fees.
That is why passengers who tried to turn them around stopped as much as possible in the package, which has resulted in the package bags being frequently filled over the seat.
Fees are an opportunity to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said, at the new fee, it's not really going to earn money.
It goes to the most trusted customers of Frontier, who had made it clear that it would be more difficult to find a place in the shop over the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline’s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger on the flight path of Frontier may take a package free of charge, but the next person must pay $100 for a comparable package.
O'Malley explained that the website of Frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed about the fee before they arrived at the airport.
The new Frontier's hand-packing fee will only enter into force in the summer, a precise date is not yet available.
Passengers often exchange packages and other charges, but airlines are willing to take back them.
They argue that the transport of the package costs money and passengers should pay this service if they want it.
Many on Wall Street consider the new package fees as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of flights after years of loss.
Most, however, are still allowed to pay for handbags.
Spirit Airlines Inc. claimed three years ago as the first charge for handpacks and later Alligiant Air followed, also a ticket pilot.
The only other airline with such a fee was the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained by Airline Brother Jay Sorensen, who carefully monitors the additional charges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the spirit's package fee would bring in 50 million US dollars annually.
Sorensen, who had previously held a lead position at Midwest Airlines, was recently aired with spirit and was curious what he would expect on the flight path if passengers were to face the company's extraordinary handling fee.
"The boarding process was part of the restless ones I've experienced in my driveway in the air," he said.
I expected to see technical and manual discussions on the flight path.
"The plane was full," he explained, "and the board loved it as it smelled."
Frontier also follows the spirit at the $2 dollar required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers, lemonade or juice bought, should be kept at all doses and coffee should be filled free of charge.
Water is still free.
US Airways had recently tried to demand freshened money in 2008, but it returned seven months later after passengers complained and no other large company was taken.
Frontier step, to raise charges for the package if passengers do not buy directly from the airlines, is the latest initiative to be made with the customers on their own website.
Flight companies pay online travel offices like Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars for a sale ticket.
This gives all companies an invitation to move passengers for direct purchase with them instead of via an online travel agency.
Frontiers, however, have gone the farthest way in this area.
In September, the company began to offer only half of the many offers of flights from an online travel office.
On Wednesday, the mile was cut by 25 percent of the flight.
A flight of more than 1000 miles in front of a third bidder is therefore only 250 miles from the customer.
Passengers can also only book on the website of Frontier places when buying direct.
Frontier has a trusted customer status at his seat in Denver, but the business breaks down and the company loses money.
The result was 9 per cent back and the flight capacity dropped almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, as in the financial report, which was published on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc..
The Republic has tried to obtain funds from Frontier in the grip of the sale of the company.
Words That Come From the Bible
Good 40 women visited the last woman's breakfast this year in the Evangelical Church of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the church house was "words from the Bible" and "speaks from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, president of the church council, entered a lecture on the Bible’s words in the morning.
"These words contain life-styles, rules or warnings," she explained.
She compared several words to the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called words such as: "Let the trees grow, as the birds fall from their eyes, and lift up their eyes to one who is in the sleep of the Lord, and wash his hands in innocence."
Several times the rapporteurs also advised their listeners what language it was spoken.
The references from the Middle Ages were adopted by the Church-Director Christel Dehner: All good things are three, blue, something goes wrong.
She explained the meaning and origin of the words she called "breaking into the past".
Finally, a tombola was released.
The prices were covered on a table and were written humorously before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round, the mayor also mixed himself with Roman Waiznegger.
Learning place unemployed: Pilot project for young people in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry was launched at the Mecklenburg Sea Platte.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as minors in the industry are to be trained by three winters to train professionals for hotels and guest stations.
"It's new that the six-month course ends with conclusions," said Carmen Wiechert from the Agency of Labour Neubrandenburg.
The benefits would be numerous: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would be deprived of the necessary expertise that was increasingly lacking in hotels and hostels, and the Agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also includes industrial and commercial rooms in Neubrandenburg as well as the Deutsche Hotel and Guests' (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA explains a "internal error" and not hackers should be on the crash of the website
The shadowy National Security Agency explained on the late Friday, an error has slowed down its public website for several hours and not hacker, as claimed online.
“NSA.gov was not available this night for several hours, since an internal error occurred during a planned update,” the spy agency explained in a message sent by e-mail.
The problem will be solved this evening.
The claim that the accident has been caused by a distribution of service attack (DDoS) has not been true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers found that the NSA website was not available for at least six hours and that is not yet available for some users.
A spokesman from the NSA against ABC News had previously stated that the Authority's sensitive internal network had been "no way" compromised.
Secret information was not in danger, so the speaker.
At least one group of hackers took the claim to have the NSA website released with a DDoS attack.
When such attacks, the target site will be transmitted with page calls until the server is transferred and the website is sent together.
The cybertactic is relatively simple and the attacks do not have to enter the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose name was first heard by No Search Agency (No such authority), is found among the bright light of the public and is seen after the findings that have been made known in recent months about its outstanding monitoring programme in the country and in the country that are critical – a result of the secret NSA data that have been stolen and published by former NSA employees Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy over the secret service created initial speculations about the outcome of a planned Cyprus operation today.
Lightly tired is the number of people without jobs in October at 22 to 1.307.
Although the quota with 3.1 percent is better than last year and also better than in September, "we had hoped for more," says Monika Felder-bauer, the business manager of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen.
Because many companies have been responding to settings for a long time.
One reason for this is called Field Farmer: "We have very little expertise in working, in health care and in caring for old age".
Annual conditions have also been re-entering job offers for staff in the hotel and guest shop since September.
The winter season begins in mid-December.
The full background report is available in the Official Journal of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Winners for Bombardier after return on delivery numbers and orders
The Canadian Aircraft and Railway Manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent decrease in the net gain on Thursday following repeated orders and delivery of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the railway party under pressure.
Bombardier, sitting in Montreal, also did not publish any flight data for his new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could be commercially used in accordance with the ambitious timetable in the next September.
Only three more start-ups followed up to three months ago on the flight of the pilot vehicle, which would seem questionable if the test phase would pass as planned.
The results remained behind the projections and led to a course of over eight percent in the Tower of Toronto.
Cameron Doersksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment of "outperform" to "sector performance" on Thursday in view of the fact that the share has a limited price potential in the next two quarters.
"We are clearly disappointed by the development of the market in transport," said Doerschen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the pilot programme for the aircraft is advanced.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries flight range can catapult the company into the lower market segment, currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew after monthly delays for the first time in September.
However, binding orders for the CSeries have been moderated by 177 since potential buyers wait for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings of the new diesel vehicle are met.
Currently there are 403 orders and orders from 15 customers and companies.
The president of the board, Pierre Beaudoin, is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
The company's management also ensured on Thursday against analysts and media, the programme is in the deadline.
"The test aircraft is no longer on the ground than expected," said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added, while the aircraft was subject to maintenance and software updates.
Each manufacturer plants different.
We have decided to take a first flight and then attach a processing period to what we have done as well.
This is happening during the entire flight programme.
The second of five pilots will be expected to start in the next few weeks, the remaining ones will have it from company side.
Nevertheless, analysts are skeptical if twelve months after the first customer's flight can take a CSeries aircraft into operation.
Bombardier explained that it will check the planning for the operation (EIS) and will update it in the next months.
"The slow progress of the pilot – even if they are clearly in line with the internal planning of Bombardiers – strengthens our view that the start-up is moving towards the first quarter of 2015," Doerschen said.
In the third quarter, at the end of September 30, Bombardiers Nettowinn fell to 147 million dollars or 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars or 9 cents per share in the year.
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged 9 cent.
The turnover was slightly reimbursed and fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts expected a 10 cent per share profit and a turnover of $4.56 billion, so Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's largest aircraft manufacturer has reported that in this quarter 45 aircraft has been delivered, a decrease of 57 in the last year.
Net orders fall from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order stock in the air and space travel party was $32.9 billion on 30 September and was unchanged against 31 December.
"In the field of air and space travel, the results were in the framework of our priorities, but the low procurement and market relations were generally disappointing," said Beaudoin.
The turnover in the air and space parties fell by 13 per cent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that the turnover in this segment has increased by almost 11 percent to 2.1 billion dollars.
The order stock in the transport party amounted to $32.6 billion on September 30, which was slightly increased against December 31.
The profit margin in transport has been affected by some major contracts in the area of transport.
According to company management, new standards will be given for the fourth quarter.
On Thursday's afternoon trade, the Bombardier Action was 8.5 per cent, and was at $4.83 Canadian dollars, after also announced that the Google Finance Board would change Patrick Pichette to the Board.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the third largest commercial airliner and bomber in the world, reported a ten-percent decline in the quarter win on Thursday.
USA: Shoes at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fires at the LAX airport on Friday morning.
While the airport management announced the short-term justice service Twitter, the protection was in danger, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that the man was dead.
A security officer has also been killed.
The media also reported several injuries.
US President Barack Obama will be informed about the situation, said the speaker of the White House, Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses offered to have seen a shield with a threat in one of the refugee camps, as several media reported.
A traveler told the messenger CNN, many people had been looking for protection in panic.
Travelers would have screamed and beat children.
Among the waiters were panicked, many had hidden themselves from fear behind bars.
He heard two shots, says a traveler of the Los Angeles Times.
A staff member of the security authority TSA had suffered a stroke on his feet.
The scene was "like in a movie."
Then he himself was taken to a security area, the man reported.
The shots should be close to a safety control area.
Airport buildings evacuated
On television it was to see how many hospitals and police cars operated before a terminal.
Hundreds of people were taken safely from the building.
Users on Twitter posted photos of a special application command and a threat on the ground.
As the air traffic guide announced on Twitter, the event began at 9.30 a.m. (a.m.).
The access routes were closed, resulting in a long return from CNN.
As long as the air traffic has been temporarily established on land, it would have been.
However, several pilots were also observed at the start on CNN.
Terminal 3 is mainly owned by smaller US airlines.
The LAX airport of Los Angeles is the largest airport in the United States.
A cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned the drug boss before police investigation must be imprisoned.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided information on world size Neil Scarborough further
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction might come to light.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court
A known criminal lawyer who warned a drug baron before a large police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug search could be detected was sentenced to three years' imprisonment.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided world-wide Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on findings about its drug-trafficking activities after he was compromised by his own cocaine search.
The lawyer who was appointed by criminals as “first-class” with the nickname “Bash” was arrested in his house in 2011 after the Scarborough police had monitored him in an earlier drug procedure.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) delivered three kokains at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he and his colleagues were eating a meal from the lawyer's room.
The findings showed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after testing traces of cocaine were found in his hair, his letter bag and credit cards.
For a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain information about the arrest of two men under the order of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police under a large investigation procedure for heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbra, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other persons, they were arrested later after the police secured $1.5 million and 200 000 in cash during a series of household searches.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could be published.
Today Ditta, who worked for the Office of the Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found and condemned in the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two cases because of the arrest of justice.
In an earlier inquiry, he added the cocaine possession.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their findings against Scarborough that this had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two intelligence officers followed the suspect and saw how he went to Dittas' house and placed the drugs with a 60 percent purity in a black golf course below the lawn.
Shortly after he had taken the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned with Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers Stadium in Ewood Park on evenings.
The lawyer returned home, stopped the drugs, and nine communications were exchanged between the two.
Before the court it was announced that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after having been detected in Class A drugs in his hair, letter bag and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but argued to take cocaine and said that he had spoken to the supposed dealer because he was his husband, and claimed that his discussion was based on the “drug secret”.
During his arrest Ditta took his letter bag and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and he was taken a hair test.
At the police station, he told him that he would work both under his private address and at his place of work a office and a mandants would call him home because of legal matters.
Before the court it was announced that he had called for important actors in the drug trade, some of whom he had previously represented, and had informed the investigators of what they knew about them.
State attorney Anne Whitte said: "A criminal lawyer should know better than everyone else that the law is not being violated."
Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defender because he has been very involved with certain mandates.
The question is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his messages were undoubtedly legitimate because he was the lawyer of these people.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between law enforcement and a man.
He acted as far as possible against police investigations so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta therefore appealed his position.
He was very close to certain mandates, particularly Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta showed any misconduct and claimed: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I would not wait 15 hours, but do it immediately.”
However, after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said: "Mr. Ditta has taken the step of a criminal prosecutor to a criminal at the time he started to acquire drugs from organized criminals."
Its cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made it available for the motivation of leading members of organised crime to include valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and trust.
Ditta has left this trust and tried to change behind the façade of his profession.
The serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the prosecutions against Ditta, which also led to a trial in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and the arrest of justice, which is undermining our determination to bring criminal proceedings before the court.
In this case, criminals should be a warning and show that no one can escape from the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison, after he had declared his complaint against heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Fifty-three other persons involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to total punishment of 153 years for drug addicts.
On his website Ditta published a range of questions and answers about himself, in which he suggested that his dream job be to represent a lawyer in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and chancellority would be the motivation for his work.
The Revolutionary Work of Church Music
At the end of the holidays from the occasion of his 160-year-old existence, the songs kranz Dunningen will provide two services with the "German Messe" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the music "Rock my life", which the audience urged this year this spring, will save the band to the end of the Jubilee year two divine services with the performance of the German fair by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary event will be heard from 19 during the evening Mass in St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, at 10.15 a.m. in the service of God in St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lakedorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title "Sacrifice for the celebration of the holy sacrifice of the Messe", D 872, is a spiritual music work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost revolutionary at the time of the creation.
The Mass will be presented in the framework of God’s service, as was the meaning of the missioner Johann Philipp Neumann.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the music group Frohsinn Tennenbörn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepsis weighs closely
For example, with the 2015 elections to the Pharmacovigilance Council, the basic changes will be made to the Haslach (SE) unit.
Then there is only one common horse-mannedate for all six horses.
At a joint meeting on Saturday, the groups from Haslach, Hofstettes, Mühlenbach, Fisherbach, Steinach and Welchenstein were preparing for the changes.
Because the fundamental decisions of the diocese are no longer to be changed and it is to be applied to the parishes as satisfactory as possible.
In the course of the day, it was particularly clear that the task against the new was slow, but with a view to confidence.
From the proposals and expectations of the 2015 updates to concrete proposals on the future composition and the size of the horse-governance board, the extremely constructive discussions of the six groups with the heads of the soulcare team are held.
Regional dekan Georg Schmitt explained through a presentation the new guidelines for health units in the Erzdiösse Freiburg.
Then the SE Haslach as a church community will form a body of public law, which will enter into the rights and obligations of the six individual churches so far.
It will be given only a common horsemanate and a board of directors represented by the pharmacovigilance office.
Of each horse, at least two selected members shall be represented, in the six horse races shall be formed in such a place.
It will be your task in the future to promote church life in the place.
The question of the financing of the individual poultry community was then an important subject of discussion.
The innovations provide that collected caves remain bound in the pharmacovigilance.
On the other hand, the bonds are passed on to the general community.
In view of the large planned investments, the obligation to meet all the horses, there was great concern.
"Even in the past, only projects that could be managed by individual horse groups were invested in the past," related Haslachs, president of the Pfharmary Council, Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint team for five horse racing, Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the team in Schutterwald-Neuried's soul care unit.
They had done the task of "Be one, stay five" in 2006 and had to make sure that this is not as simple as it is.
The groups of the Haslacher soulcare Unit then proceeded to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the Joint Committee and the practical work of the Community team.
The preparations will be concrete in further meetings and will be decided at another joint meeting of all six groups in the coming spring.
Finally, Michael Schöner of Steinach presented the new logo of the soul care unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Plentendorf, the stream will become a treasurer
Citizens of Pupplendorfs must set themselves at higher electricity costs.
As the business leader of the city works, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed against the SÜDKURIER, comes to a four-pound Pupplendorfer family 70 to 90 Euro Multicost per year.
The main reason for the rise in prices is the increase in the said EEC structure from 5,277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hours.
This facility will be re-established every year by the four operators of the major power stations in October.
These relate to the multi-cost costs arising from the energy-intensive, which can be raised by an exchange over the electricity price.
The cities of Plelendorf form the last ice in this chain.
The Board of Supervisors of the Energy Company was even excluded from an increase in its forecasts, as reported by Jörg-Arne Bias.
Now they had to calculate the actual numbers before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We're going from a 1 cent plus x addition," says Bias, where the number will be closer to the 2 cent.
Amel on a long-term route: At a waiting time
Sometimes a apple is simply not green.
The contact holes in the street do not react, or the light is defective.
So, what do you do when you're driving?
Having waited a long time for a red apple and the crossing is free, he can continue, explained by the Stuttgart Lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorroad".
However, the waiting time must be "appropriate" which could be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker is ready to release at least five minutes before a malfunction of the needle.
However, those who continue to drive in spite of red light must be aware that they bear the full responsibility for an accident caused by it.
Anyone who is patient for less than five minutes will not wait long enough, Becker warns and refers to a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice Hamm.
In the case of negotiated, a driver had ignored the apple after about three minutes and had to answer for an unfavourable red light.
The apple was not defective, but later it moved back to Green.
A ban was imposed on him because of the special situation - but the penalty was not.
The Community is pleased with the solid budget
When it comes to the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster has laughed well.
The community seal in Hervägen-szönach is well filled and debt is no longer known by the administration since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be fully achieved in this regard.
This was made clear when the 2012 annual accounts were presented.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around €7.6 million is higher than planned.
The Administrative Board's surplus is also around EUR 1.8 million over the approach.
In particular, the Committee should be aware of the higher tax revenue and the Community share of income tax.
The amount of the assets was also re-examined by the planned values.
Instead of the planned EUR 1.5 million, it was EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is essentially at higher administrative level," said Rothmund.
Since less investment has been carried out than planned in the financial year 2012, the recovery has also been higher.
Overall, the overall return of about EUR 2.1 million could now be increased to EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"It's not just a piece of work to be thrown out of the brain," said Gerster with a view to the year's accounting.
He and the community halls are very happy about the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxic, but these good numbers could soon make citizens more expensive.
By means of the good financial system, the Community in the past was able to ignore high levels of debt.
However, according to Gerster, more than once, the country had been cut off.
There are conditions for these approaches from different equations.
In particular, the cities and communities applying for grants must have certain headings.
"We have to look at the topic of hebesetze, because in the coming years we have investments for which we would like to have grants," Gerster announced in this connection.
Nagod: Hugo Wermter for 60 years in Chor
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter's story at the Men's Song of Cécilia is almost double as long as the Herbsfest, in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter stood as usual in the colors of his male singing band at the stage.
Even after 60 years, he seems to have a lot of fun singing with the love-winning choir.
Wermter was also active in the Union, among other things, for 28 years as a member of the Committee.
For his engagement and association, he received the same number of nominations: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral referendum at the Order of the Cécilienstede Rottenburg-Stuttgart, handed it over to him - since the Chor is also a Church Chore - an auction of the League and a letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His fellow singer handed him the crown of the German Chorverband as well as a gravel number.
In addition to the honor, the 31st ceremony was performed in ordinary streets: with the MGV Betra, the song choir Salzstettes, the singing section of the basingen and the local music concerts, the performers had loaded a solid mix of different choirs and music styles, which included about 400 visitors.
The MGV fullmaringen opened with voices like "In the wine paradises" and "Lustig, your brother".
Your honor singer Hubert Wermter prepared them for the honor of another small station - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts "Bundeslied".
The Men's Song Betra also sings classical Chores such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, far away" by Hubert Goisern and the folklore "When you walk through the valley".
The band band Salzstette provided his mixed chor and his group of women - the "impulscher" - for the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed chor carried out with the neopolitan folklore "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Anton Gus in foreign countries, while the "impulscher" also returned to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singing section of the Basinger Sportvereins came back to home with "What Isch der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papers "Bierlied" where the full-fledged music company lives in the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children, there was a small addition program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsheimer introduced a Kasperltheater and read a few stories that the children had worked well on the afternoon.

Kenyan press on controversial media law
"We are in a position to be found and we can ask ourselves, 'What does this Parliament want to do to get rid of the legal independence tomorrow?" was reading in the newspaper, which was not in accordance with the draft legislation.
"The law is dramatic and very punishment, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, the business leader of the Capital Group, also of CapitalFM, one of the most independent radio stations and news sites in Kenya.
He said that the new Media Tribunal "will always be advanced, because it is a longer government's poverty", and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope that the President will listen to us and we will appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government adopted the new law "the media effectively in a strike". On the contrary, The Standard, Democracy and Freedom of Speech in Kenya would have experienced "a serious blow" and meant the project as "draconic".
The adoption of the law is a number of measures to strengthen national security following the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September.
The Kenyan media focused on the jealousy of the authorities because they published recordings of security cameras, which were to be seen as the units sent out to the tator indicate the luxury shopping center.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by ordering two journalists and a leading media representative, even though the charge was withdrawn after a press upgrade.
According to the new law, media households can be punished by up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million as well as the other risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Court also has the right to challenge the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “a single punishment can be imposed by the majority of radio operators in the bank. ”
Furthermore, it is the newspaper of the view that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's description of "living blogosphere".
If they throw the media away, politicians can do what they always want.
“No one will ever experience it,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation that named the Kenyan media as a decisive control factor in public life.
"If politicians themselves take the country into the bankruptcy and return us back to the time of the wars and collectors," he commented.
The Kenyan legislators had in the past turned the public to the public.
In May, they agreed to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Compensation Commission and set their final holdings of about 532,000 shillings free of charge per month – they are the highest in the world.
Bad-Durreim: A dream will be true for the FC
In the interest of the city and the football club, the official entertainment party for the concert sports site was nothing despite the cold winter and the rain.
A more pleasant holiday day may have wanted everyone, but Peter did not want to play with it.
That's how all those who came out without the rain screen or could not hold one for any reason.
That was the musicians who turned the festival, just like some speaker.
So ours was also the FC president Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke from the fulfillment of a dream.
Thank you very much, Mr. Walter Klumpp, who has made a strong commitment to the implementation of the project, to the House of Commons, to the companies involved and to the members of the association who joined.
This is especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The rusty renter delivered 400 square meters of plastic stone for the new paths.
Mr Rombach, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, also welcomed this noble commitment.
Other big words were spoken for the City Sports Committee Hubert Baier, the district president of the South-Bald Football League, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a contribution to the youth section of the club.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that constantly repeated winding effects in the spring and autumn would replace the original breed place so that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago, there were the first considerations to solve the problem when it was thought about building a third place at the site of the football club or at the real school at the salinsee.
Both of them were fired again.
Six years ago, thinking about the construction of an art sport site, which was generally considered as the ultimate solution.
Specific plans were made two years ago when the FC took over the threshold in Erbpacht, committed a cost contribution of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the site and charged the country with 104,000 supplies.
In October 2012, the Council decided to take over the remaining EUR 356,000 to the total costs of EUR 560,000, a fixed lump.
The beginning of the 68 times 108 metres of large construction site took place on 4 June.
During the three months-long construction phase, 3000 cubic metres were cut off, half of which were used for the construction of a dry bike track.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on internal issues and justice.
This was done by the competent working group in Berlin in the morning.
In particular, direct democracy, red tape and federal police are involved.
The Working Group also wanted to continue its discussions on migration and integration on the morning.
This should involve, inter alia, the issue of dual citizenship, where the two sides have opposite views.
The SPD wants to end the pressure on immigrant children born in Germany to decide on a decision - the Union will launch a double passport.
In the matter of transport, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD submitted her no to a PKW-Maut required by the CSU.
A vignette would be a "flatrate for diversity and thus ecologically counterproductive", explained the SPD trade leader for the theme of transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There have already been outbreaks in rural areas, which are now inconsistencies.
The introduction of a wall for all pkws would be only a first step in view of Pronolds.
"There is a risk that the compensation for Germany will be reduced to a later date," he said.

Vienna Airport creates passenger calls from
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Unfortunately, like this, it will no longer be given at Vienna-Swiss airport.
A large part of the speech deficit is so off - the noise threshold should be reduced so clearly.
The aim of this innovation is to create a more relaxed atmosphere.
As airport speaker Peter Kleemann announced on Radio Wien, the Vienna Airport follows an international trend with regard to the setting of case cases involving individuals.
In particular, airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai have already abandoned the learning calls.
By the way these incidents - averagely sound one day about 200 personal calls by the speakers - it will be easier to arrive at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in experience that these individual cases have been taken relatively little, but at the same time all other information about changed flights or time of departure here is a bit below," said Kleemann in a conversation with the radio operator.
Highlander Games on the Kaltenhof
In addition to the braking system with tractors, there is another second battle at the Caltenhof on agricultural holdings from 6 to 8 September.

This is assessed with most points.
The aim of the project is to achieve the aim of the project.

Milk and egg alternatives in the overview
Vegane food requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products.
Pirate Tofu with plant size is, for example, a quark set.
Further calls the vegetarian union on 1 November.
On 1 November, the German Vegetarian Federation proposed a number of vegan alternatives to:
The pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yoghurt let go by Sojajoghurt.
Instead of milk, soya, hafer, mandel or rice milk may be used.
Adequate crop levels will replace the usual crop levels.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
For example, half a dozen bananas can replace an egg as a binding agent in a kitchen.
Also 50 grams of apples or a premixed lemon plus three lemons of water are suitable for this.
Locker is replaced by ei, for example, with a mixture of a teetelofel backpulver, an eslöffel food strength and three mineral water.
But also 50 grams of Sojajoghurt or Seidentofu can meet this purpose.

Sleepless in New York
On the way to their guest families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Zald Gymnasium learned about the American capital of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it went off to Brooklyn Bridge, which reached the heart of the city, Manhattan.
Here is already a fascinating view of the world-known Skyline, which makes a special trip in the evening.
By the time difference, the students were almost 24 hours on their feet, but the motto "The city does not sleep" was decided the day at Times Square.
Despite Shutdown, on the second day, he was able to reach the freeway with a train and to climb on foot.
Next came the financial center around the Wall Street to the memorial hall of September 11th.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating big city and enjoy the view of the Empire State Building, which is 373 meters high.
Then it went through the aesthetic route of the New York streets over the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offers an ideal opportunity for short distances in the Herbstson.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students arrived among their guest families and enjoyed the school day at Weymouth High School.
In this year, also on the name day of the Holy Hubertus, a Hubertumse is celebrated in the Church of St. Marie on the Hillsberg Street.
St. Hubertus was the story after a straight mindless jäger, who was turned over by a vision and later named the bishop of Lüttich.
The Jändhornbläser group of the Jägdreiter Westfallen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth musics on parforces (natural horn in the mood Its) after the old, original French melody.
The glasses wear the clothes because they prefer to accompany riders, horses and dogs on skiing.
The event will take place on Sunday, 3 November, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed surface shines with a new coffee.
One who calls for reconciliation and reconciliation.
One who wants to make the name of the program.
As Déjà Vu, called Lexicon a psychological phenomenon, which makes sense to have experienced or seen a new situation once.
In the case of the visit of the same-named Café at the exhibition in the town of Kleve in view of the Rhine-Weal University, it must not remain in the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, the Café with the beautiful name has exactly that objective: a real stay is not only a matter of thought but always of making it ever again alive.
Because it's really fun and it's just beautiful.
A look into the inner life of Respiratory 8 gives the viewer a good feeling about helping.
The high-modern, but not cool Café environment looks like a place for relief.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner will rent the guest with different coffee or cocktail variants.
There are expensive kitchens or individually furnished fresh baguattes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name before the opening of the beautiful café at the exhibition as gastronoms: they led the "Art Lounge" in Kranenburg.
From the return to Kleve to the exhibition, the sympathetic Café-Liebhabber became more public.
Not at least through college.
"We don't have a specific target group," said Daniel Büttner.
More and more, both young students here want to respond exactly as adults and all ages.
Near Café-Liebhababer.
The sympathic insider pair is behind the coffee-genus.
Enjoys the duplicating hot breeze in the different variations itself.
Expression
Daniel Büttner is more than the expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt is the Cappuccino drinker.
"This is a baguette - that's my thing," she told the NRZ.
Two events have already taken place in the bright Café.
Better say one.
Because the port was already out there - the Café Déjà Vu didn't benefit from it.
But there was also the ring ring ring.
The two 33-year-olds found "good, successful and wise."
But not everyone's case.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is also not a speaker of the event append: "I can't even do all right now."
And with an event I always talk to only those who are also interested in the special event.
That's why events will be the exception to us.
"We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible."
To say, Déjà Vu is also for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as to the team and the beautiful environment at the exhibition in Kleve.
The road that develops more and more into a gastronomic environment.
For the joy of many Klever, the guests from and away and the students who also discover the gastromelies and also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thanksgiving at MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation party that the MGV "Fridrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives were happy to come.
In the location of the guesthouse "Witteborg" in Dinker, all enjoyed the harmony of each other in the character of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is also always the appropriate festival to celebrate.
About the special title "Singer of the Year" was this time the writer Rolf Wagener.
"You have not only written much for us, but you have run so many rounds for us, for our heartfelt thanks," said the president of Chores Erich Schlotmann.
In this year, the nominations for participation in the events and chorpros were made by the choir leader Dieter Schulze with 44 participants, followed by the Honourable President Horst Pier-Ribbert, the president himself, and the last year's "Singer of the Year" by Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants each.
Place 5 marked Artur Brünner.
A special thank you, the board directed to the team of United Stateswirt Ange Pier-Ribert, which once more had a menu of the extract class and Gerda Pier-Ribert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Fridrich-Wilhelm" meets its regular choral samples every day at 19.45 a.m. in the United States.
"New musical voices are always welcome," Schlotmann said.
UN announces new goals in combating poverty
The United Nations will start immediately with the development of a number of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were announced 12 years ago.
In the context of the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which started at night in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in the Presidency for "Sustainable Development Goals", which will replace the Millennium Goals in 2015.
They were included in the final draft document, which will be adopted by world political leaders, including Mrs Gillard.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated on the evening of the summit that the time had come to “remember the national interests”.
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to take up an attack process to agree with the universal and sustainable development goals," he said.
"These objectives will be built on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the framework for development after 2015.
I will not be able to implement this mandate from the Member States to realize our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even if the SG Achim/Baden has been uns win-winning for four days, it continues to be a good voice by handball toplists.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon will never doubt it.
All are still fully motivated in the matter.
However, I hope that we will finally win again.
"Because I don't even know how a victory tastes anymore," Malmon expects a success experience from his husband at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the third-party reservations from Fredenbeck have not yet cleared any trees, Malmon cautions the display finger in advance.
I trained many players myself in the A-young.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-Coch.
"It is also worth waiting for further strengthening from the first one," explains the SG-Coach.
In order to finally return to the success track, the Malmon team needs to grow in comparison with the past events in any case.
In front of all things in the cover work and at the turn of the game, it was finally violent.
Even the chance evaluation needs to be definitely better.
So I hope my players have finally got their head free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in view of conflicts between influential individuals
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputos under the growing eyes of the status of Samora Machel, the state founder and first president of Mozambique to agree with a rare public demonstration of peace.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, manager of an investment company.
Fearing the future of the country, she changed her business clothes against a T-shirt with the heading “We demand security” in Portuguese and joined her on Thursday at the capital’s independence.
For almost two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of meetings between government forces and Renamo, which have been the worst since the Peace Agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was the first to be a famous rebel movement, which was originally supported by Rhodesia and later by the Government of the apartheid of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 Peace Treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will return to an increased conflict, but the latest developments have encouraged foreign and domestic investors.
For the fast-growing economy, there is a lot to play because the discovery of huge gas projects in the north-west could bring investment of over 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States in the coming years.
The ruling Freelimo Party has been the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo has been responsible for the tensions.
Renamo claimed that the government had held the most recent meeting by attacking its members in Sofala Province, a traditional Hochburg Renamos.
Renamos spoke against the Financial Times in response to the attacks by the authorities on the previous rebellions, which attacked and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group.
Renamo is responsible for the co-operation and charges the organization to attack soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to raise concerns about instability.
In contrast to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlaka viewed himself as a "reliefer", who "wanted to use all his remaining powers to prove that he could force the government's decisions".
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
However, the concerns have been raised since Mazanga was quoted with the words, namely the 1992 Peace Agreement, Renamo.
To the FT, he explained that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and be serious," said Mazanga.
Previous talks between the parties have helped to ease the tensions that have been overcome by a number of meetings this year.
"We have two grown men here (Guebuza and Dhlaka), who meet the heads," says Joseph Hanlon, a doctor at the Open University and Mozambique experts.
None of them are good at negotiating and no one is willing to make the necessary arrangements.
Renamo, who insists on electoral reforms, has already explained that they will vote in November.
Presidency and Parliament elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to prevent the use of violence, to cause state-of-the-art and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos electoral follow-up has been broken since 1992, while a new party, based on an earlier renamo member, Movimento Democracico de Mozambique (MDM), is likely to improve in elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose return will be in the end of its second term of office – wants to destroy the democracy of the country next year.
"He does not want multiple-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency's office," said Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has suddenly attacked police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection.
Most of them were found in the province of Sofala, some hundreds of miles north of Maputo, where Beira is located, using the port, mountain construction companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo had announced an attack on the road.
Mazanga replied repeatedly to the question of whether Renamo will repeat this drooping.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not good," said Mazanga.
Instability has still increased the frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, leader of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already been worried about corruption, declining progress in development and a fast pace of implementation.
"People think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrators, said people just wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and useful roads," he explained.
Children should be accompanied by myth and legends as “images for life”, meaning one author.
Thor's stories showed that "brutal force has no chance against clever tricks", and Artus legend demonstrated how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, were “to be too wild, too stubborn, and in some cases too dirty to be taught at school,” why Crossley-Holland complained for an old-school work.
"I find it wonderful that in America myth and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I've been proposing this for twenty years as a plan.
He added to the authors and teachers who would be “over-educated” children would “completely turn off, ” as the messages would be “inexhaustible” in continuous stories.
Crossley Holland, who translated Beowulf from English and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British People Tales, explained: “You can pursue certain ideas, but you should keep them in the background as far as possible."
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or led to a happy end, but there is an immeasurable sense of good and evil.
This must be shown in detail, revealed through history and not explained.
That's the old story of the show instead of story.
Hanskob points once again in Freehof
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjab spoke about his senior office in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years were in the "freehof".
Many visitors were intrigued by the extremely short stage game.
From the arrival of the grant of citizenship to his death, Drehbuchautor and Hansjab manufacturer, Alois Kraftzzyk, had designed a permanent piece, which gained much popularity under the reign of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as speakers through the ten different scenes, explained relationships, and cut off time from the youth to the next retirement.
On October 22, 1913 Hansjab came home in his childhood sky, in his freehouse.
And then the stage game began, in which Alois Krafczyk once more shined in his parade as the great son of the city.
Silecht, with the twin-spin and "black-dark-drinks" of Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
Not only was he received from the audience with much applause, but his sister Philippines also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann is incredibly well aware of moving into the role of the sister and losing her life in Mimic and Gestics.
Between the individual game scenes, the mühlenbacher grower cappelle played suitablely selected musical pieces and thus turned out to be performed.
In order to give honor to the mayor, Haslach's Mayor Heinz Winkler gave his honour, who, in the presence of the former governor, had a host with a part of the city's treaty.
Their expectations were followed by the three-king singers, who called Hansjab to the call: "How beautiful it is that youth memories will be alive in my own three-king time."
With her song "O Jesúslein" they enjoyed the audience in the open hall as well as the star-day girls with their "Heraus, Heraus".
His criticism at the office church had then expressed exactly how he was concerned about the changes in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
In the houseyard, behind his graveyard on the fire at the courthouse, he found his place of rest.
"An uncomfortable spirit had finally found his peace and was always gone," he said at the end of the stage.
Many applause and many words of praise were given by the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The Hope of Neckar Riesen
The opportunities for the remaining league of the sports-deprived Ludwigsburger Bundesliga-Basketballer have been increased.
Because there should be a Wildcard procedure, then there is now less competitor for the Neckar Riesen.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project offers an application for a possible retreat.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in Hansestadt since 2012.
However, the first appearance was not to be taken from Ludwigsburg.
"We didn't work with the Wildcard procedure, so long it doesn't seem that Düsseldorf won't get a license," Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil said in our newspaper.
Until 23 May, the ascending Düsseldorf Baskets may submit documents to the Court of Justice and prove its economic integrity to the Federal Republic of Germany.
To date, the Rhine countries have been denied the licence twice.
The Court of Justice is the last instance.
Hailerlog: Nightingale Circle Returns to the Point of View
As a contribution to the 150th year of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's cultural and tourism office devoted the last of its annual public lectures on Sunday, October 27, the evening church.

The Kröning endpoint is a visit to the evening church.
There the leaders receive the history of the church building and gain insights into the development of the Evangelical community in one way or another in a Catholic area.
In the church, the view of Friedrich Schrz, with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter, also appears in the church.
It is an original-style reproduction of the famous e-mail model of Leonardo da Vinci.

There are maps in the box of the nuclear-powered museum.
For questions and information, the Tourist Office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also be seen in Russia
Former U.S. Secret Service expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian Asyl in the US press.
Representatives of the Federal General Government could either ask questions in writing or meet in Russia in their 30s.
This was reported by the Interfax Agency on non- so-called circles that were trusted with the position.
Such a question could be made public, it said.
A trip of Snowdens from Russia is practically closed.
"In this case he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted her source.
Because Germany is a U.S. connector, dear Snowden there the delivery continued

Schrilles Piepsen disturbs the population
Rehenus Midgard has also invested heavily in the country.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the fence.
The company has several irons in the fire at the same location.
In addition to the coal imports, Rhenus Midgard is based on windlagen logistics.
Black smooths the coal on the storage site before the deich.
Split or load the coal here when necessary two powerful blue hold- and recharge devices.
For every movement of the gears, a sharp warning noise will fall over the ground.
"The signals serve security and are legally prescribed," says Matthias Schrell, executive director of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
It is sad to hear of the adverse wind - and thus there have already been some complaints by people from the city's border.
He took the complaints very seriously and contacted the victims, says the 40-year-old.
In a further discussion with the authorities, it is now possible to maintain the warning signals with technical measures.
In the future, he will also focus on the open dialogue with the neighbors.
Because Matthias Schrell has something else ahead of his place.
With the development of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rheuus Midgard continues to be a source of carbon imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the terminal-shaped lige win of 18.5 meters, Capesise-Bulkcarrier can be made here as long as possible.
"In this year we want to cut the 3 million tons mark in the conflict," says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant, the coal is imported into domestic power plants.
If the GDF-Suez power plant still goes to the network, it would be well 5 million tons of coal imports per year.
The three shipyards on the bridge as well as the second transport band could create up to 10 million.
Bayern's basketball despite first downgrading optimistic
Even the first download in the Euroleague could not bring about the huge optimism of FC Bayern Munich's basketballballs.
"No one can forbid us to believe it even against the best team of Europe in the past two years," balanced Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday at the titled Olympic Prize.
We have sent the message: In Munich there is also basketball!
At its first third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichers were sold very well for a long time, but they were simply not clear enough in the decisive stages.
The guests first managed to turn the piece of art into a 15-point retreat 13 minutes before the end, before the prize gave the game another turn.
"We have certainly fought back against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then again made slight mistakes," said Professor Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful editors of the Munichers who had celebrated the first two parties against the Italian seriesmaster Montepaschi Siena and the Polish titler Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the variable artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conferencer in the Palace Theatre on Broadway to tell the number of witnesses directly in the form of a conversation.
In the course of the year, Fays innovation was developed, as was the last time at the New York Comedy Festival.
In his life, Caroline Hirsch, founder of the standing-up institution Carolinas, celebrates this year his 10-year anniversary with over sixteen shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of this headliner started at Carolinas and then became more and more successful until they were once known to be in a club,” said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
At this annual event, there is an event by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as by “Stand Up for Heroes”, an annual music and comedy Beneficiary event for army veterans in Madison Square Garden, including Bruce Springstone, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival, the world of Comedy has also grown.
A number of Comedy Central, FX and Spike comedy, for example, have become more and more unconventional ways of participating in this year's festival.
Nick Kroll was known for sittingcom on cable television (the ironic-shull fantasy football series “The League” on FXX) and now has his own Sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the crew both at "Saturday Night Live" and at "Parks and Recreation", although she is the most famous for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, focused on racial themes W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralised world of the American Comedy.
The biggest visitors to the festival are an interview: David Steinberg talks with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but developed into a watched television and film director and an informal comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he moderated a television broadcast with the title “From Down Comedy with David Steinberg” on TV.
The meeting takes place in downtown Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the Comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me that if he's here, he sometimes goes through the gas between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose my whole money, then maybe I'll live here."
satisfied Iran with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran shows itself a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN-veto powers and Germany satisfied with the negotiation process.
"After years there is now agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to resolve the differences in recent years," wrote Foreign Minister Mohammed Dschwad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way, but the nuclear operator would be satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that at the end of both sides would be able to solve.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys Kill game cameras with makeup
In Uruguay two children killed an 11-year-old.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited their victim to go with them to the birdjagd.
With machetes and messers armed, they raided the 11-year-olds on Tuesday and threw the Leichnam into a well, reported the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
Next, they had played football in front of their apartments.
The Leichnam was found on the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach Punta del Este.
When Alibi was supposed to be a five-year-old half-brother of the student she had taken with her, she should have been sexually assaulted by the boy.
However, when the girl described the incident without mentioning an attack against her before the police, the two boys committed the alleged murder of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the old man called among others a rival in football.
He was temporarily admitted to a psychiatric youth dance.
The defendant must enter prison
Because of extreme trafficking in human beings, wages, threats, training and dangerous bodily damage, the Land Court of Constance has condemned a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen for three and a half years.
The former Federal Army, who worked after two operations in Afghanistan as a doorman, was a state of affairs within the framework of a procedural debate.
However, in five cases he has contacted women about Internet or telephone contacts that he sent against their will to the strike after a few weeks.
Opposite him to break with violence and thrifty.
He kept the incomes of the women who spent part of the year for him.
By confiscating phones and SIM cards, he connects women's contacts to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who communicated with the women, he brought them to different boards in the south.
There he let them monitor them in order to control their revenue.
At first, the accused claimed that he was suffering from a severe trauma after his colleagues in Afghanistan had come to him at an explosion about his life.
After a serious doubts about psychological limitation and therefore limited guilt, the 33-year-olds gave rise to a comprehensive state of mind.
The court did not have to take any more of the women injured.
According to a Krypo official, at least four other cases of outsourcing could be reported after a first announcement by telephone surveillance measures.
The hearings had been subjected to high aggression.
In later acquisitions, the victims had confirmed their martyrium.
Another witness, one of the women who had discovered blue spots throughout the body, has not made a statement until today.
It's about "a completely broken personality", the violence and exploitation in this metire as normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He's got rid of these circles and wants to lead a very normal life after the port," he said.
Oil price continues to be up to $96 per barrel
The oil price has also fallen on Friday, following concerns over a high offer over a report, which increases the energy-efficient manufacturing sector of China.
The reference source for supplies in December was late morning in Europe at the New York Mercantile Exchange in electronic commerce at 14 cents to 96.24 USD per barrel.
The contract fell to 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a drop in prices of 5.8 percent in October.
The large oil supply has paid the prices in the past few weeks.
The U.S. Energy Ministry stated that the US bid had taken 4.1 million barrels last week.
Within five weeks, the offer increased to 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, there was evidence of a stronger demand by two reports on an activity growth in Chinese production.
This refers to a continued recovery of the Chinese economy, which increased by 7.8 per cent in the third quarter after reaching the lowest rate in the previous quarter for two decades.
Rohle of the Kind Brent, a reference value for international oil, also used by American refineries, fell at the ICE Exchange in London at 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel.
Juice Blocked Decision on the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk Directive
A federal court in the United States blocked on Thursday the appointment of a judge who had called for changes to the Stop-And-Frisk Programme (“Keeping and investigating”) of the New York Police Department, and the judge had withdrawn from the case.
The US Court of Appeal declared that the decisions of Justice Shira Schindlin would be postponed until a city's occupation was decided.
In August the judge had condemned the city against the Constitution in the way and how the programme will be implemented for the prayers and questions of persons.
The city appealed against its assessment and the proposed aid measures, including the decision, to set up a monitoring body to support the police in amending their Directive and the corresponding training programme.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the application.
The vocational report stated that the judge had to be removed from the case because he had damaged the Code of Conduct for US judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of participation; this was partly justified by a number of media interviews and public statements in which he responded publicly to the Court's criticism.
The judge had condemned, police officers violated the rights of tens of thousands of people, because they were wrongly targeted by black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frick program.
She appointed an external position to monitor the implementation of essential changes, including reforms in guidelines, training and service oversight, and organized a pilot programme with cameras carried out by the body in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August, New York City declared itself ready to end the practice of saving names and addresses of persons who were re-examined by the police.
An oral discussion on the city's occupation is planned after 14 March 2014.
The Stop-and-Frisk tactics have been criticised by a number of civil rights defenders.
Such checks have been available in various forms for decades, but the number of checks recorded during the official period of the shared mayor Michael Bloomberg on an all-time count of 684.330 in 2011, mostly black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men who belonged to all minorities filed a complaint that developed into a collective complaint.
Representatives of changes in the NYPD's Stop-and-Frisk Programme say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more reliable and effective police and influence the way other police leaders implement the regime.
On the other hand, changes would affect the moral of the police, but not the crime; money would also be spent and the wider problem of a police, which, after thousands of jobs have been under pressure in the last decade, will not be solved.
The Director pointed out that it does not end the stop-and-frish practice which is constitutional, but only reform the type of implementation of controls by the NYPD.
The Happiness of the Dreaming Camel
Happiness is an oasis that reaches only dreamy camels
With this insight, the first president, Wolfgang Henne, described the history and fascinating of the "Helping Hands".
On Saturday, the tenth birthday of the Union was celebrated, which can already have considerable success.
The first president told her in detail about the work of the Union.
In 2004, he was the first time in Mauritania in the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, further cooperation was developed, and the Gynaecologist led many operations on several trips.
During the talks, images of the placements were shown on a large canvas so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the above-mentioned actions.
The unit's desert vehicle has also been shown.
It is a former federal defence vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed that this vehicle be equipped with a photovoltaic system and now, according to her, be used together in consultation.
In 2008, the room was built in the Bayersbrunn Schleeh in the record time of nearly a week, the hospital in Socogim, an estate district on the edge of the capital - honorably.
She also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times where birth clinics are to be vegratified in Nagold.
You learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, so she learns, for example, the solution to burnout.
Because of the political unrest in the country, many travel as planned was not possible, but many doctors came to Germany to visit here in different areas.
In addition, in March this year medical equipment, medicines, binders, hospital beds and glasses are regularly sent to Africa.
Mitinitiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered a lot of local coloring by telling him about Mercedes vehicles built around the mobile railway station from Mauritania and describing the experiences of the native musicians who traditionally supported the union during their Mauritanian journey.
As his personal motivation, he called his work in the field of accounting as a young rapporteur.
When it became clear how much money was lost along the way, he decided to help Africans in controlling a budget by the people.
In addition, birds stressed that global economy also requires global human love.
It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
Not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson set a phone hacking to check a tip
The former News of the Word issueer Andy Coulson said that he was trying to prove a false tip on a case by the then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
State lawyer Andrew Edis QC told the court in Old Bailey, News of the World, in May 2005, that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper urged the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hunt Pawlbys Voicemails, and followed her, but Coulson also called on and left news as the court experienced.
"In the view of the state government government, Coulson, who is now the publisher of the needW, is no one who stands in front of the people's apartment and hopes to catch them on fresh ground, but one who wants people to face a story to see their reaction," Edis explained.
He said, NotW used three methods to investigate history research: telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows from the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can't be.
How does it look with the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking order?
He argues about it, but we say, "And if he knew it."
Laughing over a affair, Clarkes were first touched by the feature edition of NotW, when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A band with voicemails from her phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in the apartment of Mulcaires.
The detectors also found entries on the computer of the detective, the Pavlby and their sister were stored as “projects”.
During the time when the search was conducted, the grandparents received anonymous calls from Paullby, where they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup were monitoring the movement of Pawlby.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following: "I have a story we want to bring out tomorrow that I want to talk to Charles about."
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blonket.
The complainants heard on Thursday that Coulson Blackett had faced an affair with a married woman when he himself was in love with the mythical Rebecca Brooks who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks strive to have sex with others, to hack telephones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have given the phone hacking.
From protest against planned rain tax, the French football will actually take over the first strike since 1972.
A lightning strike is inevitable at the end.
In the conflict about the rain tax, the government and the professional football in France have managed after a failed sludge in a tank gas.
President François Hollande responded on Thursday at the Paris Palace of Élysée and Relations and also heard their complaints.
However, he refused to lose the football for more than one million euros per year from the planned 75 percent commission planned to pay all companies in the country for two years from 2014.
The opposite also remained hearty.
The strike announced for the end of November will now be carried out, with Jean-Pierre Louvel, the Chief of the Association of the Proficulubs (UPCF).
The play days set out in League 1 and League 2 are thus due between 29 November and 2 December.
Gently: No absolute protection possible
"We want to join the residents early in the planning," opened Mayor Jens Häußler the public information event for the high water protection concept in Gechingen.
About 80 participants came to the Community Hall to explain the planned measures, ask questions, express thoughts and bring ideas.
Häßler made it clear that "the final decisions are the members of the Council".
The flood, which occurred on 15 May 2009, was an unprecedented event, which raised the issue of protection for the future.
A river area survey was commissioned by the neighboring village of Adilingen, which is now the basis for the high water protection concept in Gichingen.
"The protection of as many of the building blocks as possible is the goal," said the owner.
On the basis of the plan of protection before a German weather service is statistically expected every 100 years to be high water.
The climate change is taken into account by a 15-percent addition.
In professional circles this is called "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses, which had suffered considerable damage in 2009 in Ghengen, were a 1000-year high water.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," said the owner.
In order to achieve HQ 100aClimate protection, around €4 million must be invested in gears, where the communities with land-uses can account for about 70 per cent.
However, the Houses pointed out that the promotion is only given when a whole concept is implemented.
The Community should therefore refer to the intervention of the citizens.
An exciting planning and authorisation procedure must be completed.
In the best case, 2016 could be started with implementation.
Among other things, the concept of protection, which has already been presented in the Community Council last week (we have reported) provides for local measures by means of the river Irm from the river home.
In connection with the presentation of the high water protection concept, the participants used the opportunity to present their case.
Among other things, it was asked why the dams and reservoirs were no longer planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, expert planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that the combination of all the measures proposed is necessary to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, if you had to find the most economic solution, Joachim Wald of Wald and Corbe.
Unmut was the ruler of the Altor, who, in the case of normal windmills, had to suffer again under the overload of the channel network.
The problem is known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
However, the Guidelines for Canal Systems have proved to be different from those for high water protection and should not be missed.
The Community was obliged to set up the channel network so that two-to-three year regenerative events could be strengthened.
The water canals are larger to scale, millions would break down.
Severely affected by constipation
On the morning of Friday afternoon, two car drivers were seriously injured on the road near Ravensdorf.
The police stopped the street right away, but they could say little about the accident.
However, there are various cases of evidence that should be assessed first.
It is believed that the 19-year-old lenkerin of a VW Golf in the direction of Ravensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came against her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles fell together, where the woman was so badly dressed that the fireman needed almost half an hour to get her out of the vehicle.
The actual accident remained unexplained at first.
Both victims arrived in nearby hospitals.
The street was closed for about two hours.
You could call him the U.S. Dostojewski.
Philip K. Dick was a Godtsucker, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories have a series.
Disturbing the connection in the outside: the rising eyes, the bar, the high stars.
And as Fjodor M. Dostojewski is to understand with his massive Oeuvre as the founder and apologetic of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet who has something to do in his own country.
Some titles have appeared in Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans tapes with 118 stories are distributed in two thousand.
Dick explains America - the realm of amazing technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security and faith, to be chosen.
Dick had divine experiences, his late books read like a blend from the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had added drugs to his brain.
He's figured out early that the computers are deities.
He wrote a computer theology and asked what distinguishes a person from a machine, the Creator of his creation.
That's the "Blade Runner" problem.
Kill it.
A Master of Science Fiction.
A great writer.
His stories inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Ministership Report" comes from 1956, which inspires the spirit of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
This is where the principle of "pre-crime" is developed, "pre-crime", so what is between the more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is the same as our alarming world, there are mutants looking at the future - and the police are taking action.
"We understand individuals who have not broken any laws," says the head of the authority.
"We'll cut them off before they can commit a crime of violence."
And, "In our society, there are no serious offenders, so we have a punishment full of pesudian criminals."
They believe that evils are happening and prevent criminal thought from being applied in practice.
Dick's story works like the blue break for the anti-terror gesture and the NSA's hearing.
Anticipation of the approach: So does Obama Drohnen-Philosophy and Praxis.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The police chief regrets that there is no more division of power, the military controls every day - and what is left of the state.
Then the monitor himself will be monitored and transferred to a future crime.
The system is going through.
It's perfect, but it's a lie.
It meets its own requirements.
It takes iron and sacrifice not only to buy but also to build on it.
The system creates the danger it is fighting.
Philip K. Dick reads, always comes closer to the truth.
Spähaffer about Merkel in Russia
Former U.S. Secret Service expert Edward Snowden could also make statements about Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel in his Russian Asyl.
Representatives of the German Federal Government could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-olds in Russia personally, the Agency reported Interfax.
Earlier, the Green Bundestag's director Hans-Christian had met Snowden as the first German politician in Moscow yesterday to talk to him about the affair.
strengthening NSA reconciliations due to State surveillance
On a quiet day at the end of August, a German police officer flew deep over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the capital of Germany.
At the instruction of the Federal Institute for the Protection of Constitution and the Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German Home Service, he should photograph the roof of the US external post, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to demonstrate the presence of monitoring agents and the action led to a exchange of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, once again said in September that the United States did not use the possibility of foreign spying "to secure the secrets of foreign companies in the US-American company's mandate so that they could develop their international competitiveness or their profits."
However, since Edward Snowden, who has become the sole employee of the Whistleblower, who has started publishing his full horn to U.S. monitoring secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure that they can take the Director for a word.
Reports that the American National Security Agency is spying on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and has created data from American cloud suppliers including Google and Yahoo, have brought the company paranoia to a new highest level due to state surveillance.
The fascism led to the idea that Chancellor Angela Merkels had been engaged on the phone for perhaps ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be seen as a visitor, the company's leadership is certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between U.S. secret services and companies transparent.
I think it is likely that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany has to wake up," said Oliver Green, president of the BITMI, the small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US now poses almost as high a risk as China when it comes to industry spying and data laundering, a survey published in July by the EY consultant company.
However, in the documents secured by Snowden, there was no indication that the US had extended the secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern about the lack of specific IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce their dependence on the US.
In this respect, companies are skeptical.
On the day of Bundesag it was proposed that we build a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and open them slowly...
"This doesn't work," says Hasso Plattner, president of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal over cars to agriculture.
Everything until the IT industry.
However, richness and technical refining of the US spy authorities discovered by the Snowden massacres have shocked companies that had previously seen the largest spying risk in China.
Cloud Computing is a major change because European business leaders are now aware that data stored in the US are subject to existing legal discussions and are thus potentially dangerous.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade agency, the U.S. Data Mining Activities are expected to use about ten percent of U.S. members' plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, the deputy business leader of SAP, says: “We see a new question of customers who haven’t given it a year ago – they say: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that this will remain physically in this area of law?”
Many German corporate leaders represent the view that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore need to be preserved at every price.
It's not surprising that the economic spy is taking place.
That's always been the case.
"It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, president of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans spy on us at a commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in national interest to defend our companies.
The company's management usually does not take advantage of the measures taken, because it receives benefits from the attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been suggesting that the company of a free USB stick on a show or the unexpected lease of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a member of the board of directors at the Autoproducer Audi, says that it has been part of the standard practice for years before a board meeting to collect telephones so that they can not be used as sound devices.
The German BVT is equipped with driving forces to easily use prepaid handles when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The Prepaid Handys were subsequently removed.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are world market leaders in the Netherlands.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access," warns the BVT in a report.
The US warns its own companies against economic spying through other countries.
According to Washington Post, the US National Intelligence Estimates in February France, Russia and Israel behind China were organized into two of the countries that served to purchase economic data from the hacking.
A member of a German blue chip company agreed that when it comes to economic spying, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former director of the French Home Service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: “The secret services know very well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
Hechingen: Messe provides answers to wedding questions
"The marriage is the most important discovery journey that humans can undertake," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, as at least the wedding party reached, now gave a special event in the domain in Hechingen.
Representatives were important providers around the time of wedding.
A trend: The retro-look has been re-enacted.
It starts with the wedding dressers.
White is a must, best covered or in cream.
In the past, the many dressed and dressed clothes are closed, often with a sleigh, but they go down the back and end often in a bed.
However, the spirit is different, as Stephanie Koch points out from the fashionhouse dress mill.
In the Lords, the approach dominates West and Plastic, but it can also be chosen creamy or brown combinations.
It's important to choose the location. It's explained.
Beautyless rooms are not ideal, the environment should be especially.
Here the domains drew attention to their own offer in the remiss.
Anyone who wants to proceed with the kitchen has an offer for Uwe Link.
"Cuts are also popular for young people," he says.
Romantic is also asked for loading cards, flower arrangements and wedding photos.
More and more in fashion, the "After-Weding-Photo" - so recording in special places, in particular some water cases, some days after the party, but in wedding dress, Elizabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangements, rings, wedding table, kitchen and also a shopkeeper, such as Marco Ripperger, who can keep guests with style.
Don't forget the right cosmetics and needle care.
Everything for an unforgettable party.
Hundreds of friends are successful
For the next time, the sportsmen of the hundreds of Bitz friends were successful in a Rally-Obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Candel with two dogs; with his dog Sandy he scored 94 points in the starter class and secured the fifth place, and with 15 months old Marley brought it with 87 points in place.
Susi Höpp, with her Woody in Class 1, took the critical views of the Executive Director.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in tragic accident believed in murder
The parents of the teen, whose body was found in a joint ringermatt in the tournament of his high school, are convinced that her son was murdered, explained the lawyer of the family on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on 11 January in a straight-up matte that stood behind the Tribune in the school hall.
The investigation officers of the Sheriff of Lownde County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the family of the 17-year-olds doubled.
“They are convinced that her son was murdered,” said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, against FoxNews.com.
They never believed he had died, as the sheriff had concluded.
"They are the view that every logic is hidden from the laws of physics as well as from the human health concept," said Crop.
More and more they were convinced that the truth would be betrayed to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school and came back to the gym," he commented.
U.S. government lawyer Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation of Johnson's death, as a number of important questions are still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Should his death be brought back to a crime?
This was explained by Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts to which they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I represent the view that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson was dead following a “positional recovery”.
A second autopsy, however, has resulted in another cause of death, such as Moore.
"There are a number of questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he will be charged with carrying out the investigations by the FBI.
A representative of the County Sheriff's authority was not ready for a comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in South Georgia ruled on Wednesday that the authorities must release all surveillance videos that have been checked by the investigators.
The teenager's parents said they hoped that the video recordings would indicate how he died.
CDC public education policies for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a number of guidelines for the treatment of food allergys for children in schools.
These are the first of these directives issued by the US government, as the number of children in school is increasing with food allergy.
One of 20 children in the United States has food allergy.
The distribution of food allergy among children, according to CDC, increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools that should raise awareness of food allergy and how to interact with children, show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have prepared Epinephrin – the most commonly used self-injection of the EpiPen brand – to prevent a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Lawmakers in the Federal States have recently amended the rules so that Epinephrine schools can be easily prepared.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms called children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something pushes on my tongue,” “My tongue feels like a hair is on it” or“My tongue sucks.”
Parents of intersexual children can choose "Sexually Indeterminate"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children born with unclear genetics.
Newborns are no longer assigned to male or female.
According to the new law, parents must no longer explain sex to such children, but they may indicate "undefined" or "not determined" to the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to pressure parents not to make any cross-border decisions regarding sexual orientation operations in newborns and to combat discrimination against persons of intersexual nature.
According to BBC years later, an intersexual person said: "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I'll keep the film work created by doctors, silenced and filled with tears.
It is estimated that one out of 2,000 children does not come to the world each year as a youth or as a girl.
They belong to the intersexuals, a group that falls under the diagnosis of “Sexual Dispersion” (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomal, chromosomal erythema (iron or hodens) or unusual genetics.
Wallis Simpson was probably intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is not yet very well developed, but most experts in the United States suggest that the best available information on sex should be used, if it is not possible, and not on the psychological and physical development of the child, before deciding – if at all – for an operation.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problems of gender identification, said that the new German law "slow to a good thing".
Intersexual children exhibit an ethical dilemma.
"Many people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but for most children, that is not true," he said.
You can take a sexual indication without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child is already developing his sexual identity are not very accurate.
No one knows why it's happening.
It's like the secret because people are gay.
In a report to the European Commission of 2011, it is said that intersex people are different from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not sexual, but is required by their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were reflected in late sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, preservation, breasts and structure, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genetics, or chromosomal structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination against persons who are exposed to intersex and transgender in their careers and of the extent of impunity, violence and prejudice.
Not with the sex picture matching boys now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, for adults, it is possible to refer to official documents either male, female or “third sex”.
In June Australia, Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognised as the first “unsexual” person in the world after a court granted the long maintenance of a “undefined” sexual status.
In addition to M and W, Germany has a third assignment, X for intersex, so the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France sex themes are still controversial, so a message to France 24.
In 2011, thousands of French officials of the strict Catholic country signed a petition to remove the “Geschlechtertheorie” from schoolbooks.
The U.S. Catholic Online website has also spoken against the German law, reasoning: "If the world is shaken into a new state where sex represents a decision, but not sexual activity, we will risk two more spheres of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland declared against Baby Zone that it would be better if babys would be given sex at birth.
"The parent-in-law is also hard enough without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your own child," she said the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female sex, called hermaphrodites, were born after the attractive Greek God who had both sexes.
Even ten years ago, the medicine considered sex to be something you could erase and then build up again.
However, in the meantime, the ethical foundations of an operation are confused after it is now known how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when raising the child with the sex assigned to them.
“In the 20th century it was called a ‘psychiatry emergency’,” said Drescher.
If such a child was born, it was not called the psychiatrist, but the surgeons.
The ruling theory about the treatment of children with no specific genetics goes back to Dr. John Money from the Johns Hopkins University, who shares the view that sex is promiscuous.
He praised the concept of “sexual identity” and argued, social and environmental harassment – such as parents raise a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child, and wondered whether a person was considered male or female.
However, in a case known as "John/John" since 1966, his theories were controversial.
He laughs at the parents of a young man whose pension has been cut off at an obscenity to throw the child away completely and also remove his bones and then raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example for a conversion which he was not,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he changed to male sex and married a woman.
My 38th was suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, survivors of these sexual operations have joined the public, who are “not happy with the result”.
This is how Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, was born with XY human chromosomes, but second generation.
The doctors were not aware of whether he had a large clinic or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “satisfying life” as a man.
So his external organ and the hoden were removed soon after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he explained against ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone for the development of genetics.
After learning the truth, he changed to male identity, received testosterone injections and was able to remove his breasts.
The operation has made him unproductive.
Today, he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project to take intersex people as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the California legal group Advocates for Reported Choice, ensures that the German law can “encourage stamping and stifling”.
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision may encourage parents to make quick decisions and to give the child a ‘not established’,” she explained.
We are afraid that this will benefit intervention.
We think it would be better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we still do not know how the law will affect itself, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because “it allows adults to recognize as a third sex”.
" Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she explained.
The German law refers to the designation of birth.
It is not a struggle to force small children at this time.
If they are grown up, they can decide for themselves about their own body.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Brustradiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual disparity disorder and hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law “full” both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She's got a vagina, but she doesn't have any eggs and no eggs.
Today, Katie is married to 29 and works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in the Child Psychiatry.
Although it is infertile, however, it hopes to be able to obtain a child by adoption or by adoption.
"The law has a room for parents, so they do not have to make decisions too quickly," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do various tests and clear things and gives them time to write them “human” or “female”.
In this way everything is fine – you bring the child big and love it.
You've got a wonderful baby and you're enjoying parental happiness.
And you don't have to carry out an operation that doesn't make you shy anymore.
"This concludes the children in the decision with one and eliminates the fear of parents because they think they would not do the right thing," she explained.
Finally, the child decides about the sex that is best for him – and that is wonderful.
As a result, children will be able to make the decision themselves.
Unknown hurt girls by shooting from the car
Unknown people have damaged a 12-year-old in Saxony by shooting from a car.
At Donnerstagbend in Genthin, the targets may have fired an air pressure weapon on a group of children.
That's what the police in Burg shared.
The girl was easily injured on the left wall.
Rescue forces brought the girl into the hospital.
The committee came from a small car that had been passing on to a group of six children and had been arrested suddenly.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The tatters also shot at a bus stop.
A ship broke.
Then they heard of it.
The criminal police reported it on Friday.
Up to now, police inspection teams can look back at a quiet Halloween night.
The officers were called only twice to attack children who fought against domestic violence.
Since the owners of the house recognized this at the right time and even removed the estate, there should be no damage.
In addition, some Sylvester powders were also burned in the city area, but there were no damage here either.
A resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer road reported that his pkw was developed with cloppy and his radar lights were used.
Until the police arrived, however, the man discovered his radar lights in the immediate vicinity, so the police had to stop operating.
Living with a future perspective
In fact, Waltraud Ries lives in a dream.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of greens, an old building, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
There are only a few minutes of public transport in the city.
"They hope no fear of spins?" asks Waltraud Ries and shows on a fat spin at the door.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for a while.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not a spinnaphobie, but the concern, in old age, is that you can no longer manage the many steps to the house and the apartment.
In addition, since a Meniskus operation, the midwife has had to experience in her own body what it means to move with the handle of Stockwerk to Stockwerk.
Before long, a book from her appeared on the subject 'Happy to live in age - Which kind of residence is best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what's not going on in old age' she begins to tell.
When she and her husband moved to the Masonette apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, with the average fifty-five, Waltraud Ries thinks otherwise.
However, she also knows that she belongs to the few people who are totally different from the subject 'Living in age'.
Most of them spend it as long as it goes.
Everything's always going to be just the others', they say.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great can you think about it.
'Then it can be too late,' said Ries.
In her book, the interior architecture presents 17 housing models for an individual residence in the old age.
'What kind of housing you choose, though, is always an individual decision' she explains.
D i e solution is not available for the age.
Even those who can handle the nursing home in Tuscany or Britain should always be convinced that he can get sick too.
And: 'Without the good knowledge of the language of the country, you are also united in the Dolce Vita,' the author of thesis will be willing to think.
Among its models are classic care models, alternative forms of housing or the often quoted Renter-WG.
In old age, everyone has his tickets and makeup.
'There would be no community like this for me,' they say with one eyebrow.
Not even like in a student WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen.
'In old age, you just need your backrooms too,' said Ries.
However, that a senior housing community can function, the accounting authority does not want to exclude it.
But that must be different from the classic student WG.
And sometimes you just want his rest, she thinks.
In this opinion, at least she is not alone in the capital city.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment for so long' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the leader of the civil service life in the old town of the capital.
Your service tells people about the topic 'to get older'.
That is why even older people would often buy inconsistencies and restrictions just to stay in their usual environment, which is also the experience of the Warentest Foundation.
Today there are many opportunities to design the house or apartment freely.
Ries recommends that all those who work with the older-right construction of their house or apartment should first inform themselves thoroughly and not be assigned to the first-hand workers.
Today there is also for the older-right reconstruction specialists.
Even in the apartment, it is possible to realize one or the other, and if it is only the height of the toilet, the interior architecture is clear.
But it is not always possible for the existing apartment to be redesigned in an old way, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
Although within the apartment you could install a wooden elevator, which would also be the widest obstacle to the apartment wall.
She will search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the conversion, it is more fun than before the spin of her apartment.
USA wants to prosecute Snowden further
The United States has not changed its attitude to former U.S. Secret Service employee Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be denied access to confidential information.
So he had to take a criminal procedure in the United States, said the US Foreign Ministry spokesman Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Nor would the latest remarks of Snowden be changed.
The German Green politician Hans-Christian had previously appealed to the United States after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, not to continue threatening him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that there was a strong appeal to a parliamentarian and not to a German member of the government.
Secret servicer Edward Snowden is basically ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to clarify his situation.
This was made clear by former NSA staff from the United States in a non-addressed letter, which was published by Green Politicians Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and sent to the Federal Government, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Federal Government.
The letter has the following wording after a translation spread by strokes:
To the competent authorities
I was asked to write to you about your examination of mass monitoring.
I was called Edward Joseph Snowden and previously engaged in a direct operation as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
As regards my employment in these institutions, I was a witness to the systematic violations of the laws of my government, which required me to act out of moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these thoughts, I saw myself being set up with a difficult and persistent host who forced me to leave my family and my home.
I am now living in exile and enjoying a refreshed asylum, which gives me the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by resonance to my political actions, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also high officials - including the United States - have been judged to be an all-embracing surveillance system, which is not responsible for any accounting, as a public service.
These speculations led many proposals to new laws and directives that focused on the widespread abuse of public confidence.
The benefit of the company from these findings will be further clarified; at the same time, the risks taken in buying have been significantly reduced.
Although the results of my efforts have been positive, my Government still deals with them as a fraud and then seeks to criminalize political opinions and accuse them.
Nevertheless, speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the Government of the United States, with the support of the international community, will take this stand.
I hope that if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are identified, I will be able to participate in the responsible statement of the case with regard to the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, and in accordance with the law.
I am pleased to speak with you in your country as soon as the situation is clear and thank you for their efforts to ensure international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden owned by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Child gardens have found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Mayor Michael Maier of Winterlings.
The former children's garden in the garden street has sold the municipality to a private person.
The sales were agreed by the Council at its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owners to a "appropriate" price.
"The community is satisfied," stressed Maier.
The budget amounted to EUR 100 000.
It's still not clear how the new owner wants to use the old children's gardens.
The mayor is right that Winterlings have delegated responsibility for the building before the winter to someone else and therefore no longer have to stand up for the maintenance of the house, how to warm up to look after the garden and to clean up the wall.
"This move is gone now," she rejoices.
Place concert at high summer temperatures
The music show Hammereisenbach offers a concert on the terrace of the guesthouse Hammer.
As director Bianca Willmann has the Taktstock at 19.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 audiences are pleased with the voices of Hammeric musicians.
The president, Manuela Honeck, explains the music.
Honeck thanked all those who had helped to handle the first music hockey successfully.
Report: Obama campaign highlighted to replace requests by Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's most recent advisors have been in secret to replace Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election battle, as the New York Times said.
The ending is the most significant surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-expected work on the 2012 election match, “Dubble Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times presented a copy of the book that appeared first, and she reported on Thursday that the president's superiors had conducted "exceeding group meetings and questions at the end of 2011" to find out if there was a better hope for Obama to look forward to re-election when he was asked.
According to Jonathan Martin, National Political Correspondent of the Times, the book is basically drawing on the history of the efforts of the campaign's leading staff and the White House, namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact it has had on the refurbishment of former Foreign Minister Clinton against Vice-Presidents.
The potential change was a strictly heated secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and Oval Office.
Only half a thousand of the most senior advisers of the president – including Daley, former campaign leader Obama, Jim Messina, and former senior consultants of the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – were aware of the expected change.
In the “Dubble Down” it is claimed that Daley had stood at the top of the effort, asking her “one, personal relationship” to change, before finally deciding against such a move, after the data showed that the candidacy of Clintons “would not significantly improve the chances of Obamas”.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government has actually managed to replace requests by Clinton.
"I went out of a whole series of things to consider, and that was one of them," Daley explained to the magazine.
It must be recalled that the President was once fearfully offended, so we thought: “To God’s will, what shall we do?"
While Daley referred to the studies as “absorbed care”, Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign for re-election, there was a great deal of effort to find out whether such training was paid in view of the elections.
"In campaigns, not much money will be spent on surveys and focus groups if you don't seriously think about something," Martin explained at AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin said against CNN, he asked Daley if his immediate boss knew about the potential change.
Although Daley explained that he did not believe that the president of the possible change was "conscious", the former Chief of Staff told him that it was possible to have Obama aware of it.
Martin added that “Dubble Down” did not give a definitive answer to the question whether the political probes had reached Obama's writing table.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama knew nothing of the investigations about whether it was supposed to be allowed to happen at the election.
"Maybe," said Martin.
What's going on with my e-mail?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
If the Internet service is designed by e-mail, is it technically used in writing?
In the design of early Internet services, communication was essential.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not been taken into account in order to create a stable foundation for a secure exchange of letters.
Therefore, a usual e-mail is more like an open mailbox than a sealed letter.
If the user "Anna" sends a mail to "Benni", are the computers connected directly?
The e-mail program or Anna's browser sends the mail first to the mail server of its service provider.
If she has a GMail account, for example, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider using Benni.
On the street, the mail can run over a number of other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the contents to his provider.
Are ordinary e-mails being shared via the network on their way?
Most emails are read several times by software robots.
When providing the sender, the mail is usually checked whether the message is accompanied by a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the provider will check whether it is a free and unwanted spam mail that is being deleted or at least deleted into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
In systems such as GMail, the robot also identifies the information that Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming trip, Google can link links to holiday offers.
Even unknown people read the e-mails with?
The probability that unauthorized people are reading a message is extremely small.
It's theoretically possible, though.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read e-mail.
Criminal prosecution authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to receive e-mails or to receive information.
This will result in possible illegal rescue actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from reading?
An e-mail can be effectively encrypted against reading by encryption according to the OpenPGP standard.
With high technical output it is also possible to disseminate the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it cannot be identified without further identifying who has communicated with it.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
Yahoo and Google will play only a sub-ordered role for the mostly private mail carriers, according to a survey of Convios Consulting from August 2013.
While the parts of Yahoo mail were last dropped, GMail was able to clearly apply to Google.
Mother shakes in the forest and rents interest
When his busy mother died, a man from Wolfsburg broke a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to cast their interest and support money.
A 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after police investigation in the forest.
First, he was sentenced to death at the age of 89, then he spent more than half a year in prison.
Now, 67-year-olds have to answer for fraud, as a speaker said on Friday.
That night the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: at the time, it seemed that no medication was needed for the needy mother.
The investigator told the Rentner that his mother had moved to Spain.
Because the officials did so in a remarkable way, they continued to notice.
It became clear that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and had placed them at last.
Finally, 67 years of age, his mother died.
According to the police, an abortion did not give rise to a capital offence.
Listen to ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first shining ice in the dark – with the help of Quellen.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the seabeds and created a brilliant cure.
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on qualls and Chinese scientists were able to convince him that the lighting protein was artificially produced.
The eiscreme reacts to the consumption with the sound causing the pH to rise in the protein and release the light.
Chris explains that the food reacts to the heat in the mouth and shines – the more one shines, the more light it will be.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is unbelievable, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the sound at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH increases and the ice shines.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seems ideal for us to bring it to Halloween on the market because it has this wonderful light effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever produced, because the quality light material is four times more expensive than gold.
Every bullet cost me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes nice for that.
Charlie's experimental company with a seat in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes, which include beer, cheese, beef and leaves gold.
But his latest creation should be even more ambitious.
He says, "I want to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is on and on account of the lack of light produced by ice crystals from which ice cream is made, but I was afraid we would find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a cave made artificially by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still six days after the game, without any point in the handball league.
Counted now it will be for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last week.
With this game, the season begins again for us.
"I hope we finally have the head free," Ehler's behavior is optimistic.
Finally, with the exception of the permanent Hendrik Bloom, he has his complete framework available.
The same is true of the Daverden.
That is why we need to keep our error rates low.
First, however, it is appropriate to increase in coverage, which has left all other than a safe impression.
The first season against Nordhorn is clearly more relaxing after the daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz.
Of course, the game was a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because in Derby it can always happen.
However, Panitz now wants to stay in Morsum to start a series.
Missing Jan-Malte Jodat.
To this end, the A-Young Joost Windßust, who is active at the A-Young Bundeslist HC Bremen, is a season break.
Whoever's not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were supposed to eat sweets, stay late and dress us for the neighborhood.
Today I've become a Halloween muffel.
In the last two years, I have not yet declared myself to be separated from my apartment, and it will probably not be done this year either.
But according to statistics, I'm a black creature with Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be exactly – celebrate Halloween this year and spend 6.9 billion dollars on sweets, costumes and decorations, such as the US-American league of individual dealers (NRF).
One thing I'm happy about every Halloween then again is the trend values.
The costumes will cost about 1.2 billion of 6.9 billion dollars spent, as the NRF will do.
In this year there are disturbing objects of the last cry.
Women don't have to lie in sexy clothing anymore, they can also now feed infectious foods such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expected every amount of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I know that the daft-punk-well men will be created this year in the Instagram feed.
According to Google, the most sought costumes are Zombies, Batman, pirates and Hexen.
I guess it's nothing wrong with tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs and were not alone at my funeral.
In fact, US dollars 330 million this year for the costumes of their pets, such as the NRF.
That's a lot of hot dogs.
As far as we're concerned, we're not clumsy.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year on it, says The Nielsen Company.
These are some 270 million kilograms of chocolate, sugar, beans and rubber.
So good news for the U.S. Department of Commerce 41 million people who take the phrase “Süss or Saures” through the quarter.
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we do not want to eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sugarcandy corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, so the National Association of Southern Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion masculinators.
It's a puzzle I couldn't solve yet.
Nothing more belongs to Halloween than houses where it belongs.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls", "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized sponsors in the United States who earn 500 million dollars, such as America Hauts, and this includes the wonderful photos on which you just put yourself in the house and then put friends on Facebook, where you don't lose them again, and then one of the type on which you are standing, leaves a comment like "after facial expression".
But we'll finally get to the curves.
Charlie Brown trusted us with the Great Corps when we were children, and the cut of a cervix is like the beauty of the Christmas tree – something we've done from little to little.
Fortunately, the "Baby in the Courbis" trend began in the last year thanks to Pinterest, so that most of us were raised to cut off the Curebis and not to sit in it.
This year, Americans are spending about 106 million dollars for bugs, the US Census Bureau.
The circulatory system, which slows down in the front yards, is probably derived from Illinois, where this year 245 million kilograms of curbisse have been collected.
If you want to score correctly, then call Tim and Susan Mathhisdon in Napa, California and cut some of their 921 kilos hard curves.
Residential fire in Helbrechts: Rescue forces mountains frozen bodies
The fireman had to get out of Hellbrücks on the late Thursday afternoon.
A three-family house in the countryside Court is set up in the night for Friday fire.
The rescue forces mount a frozen corpse out of the house.
Rescue forces have found a frozen body in a three-family home at a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it's about a resident is still unclear, as a police speaker in Bayreuth said.
In the late Thursday afternoon, it was burned in the basement of the house.
When the fire extinguishes, the flames are already running out of a window.
The use forces went into the apartment and found the bodies in a room.
This and another room completely burned out.
The whole earth was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spoke further.
The building would not be viable for the first time.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unclear.
Germany's largest country church has launched an offensive campaign to hire the pastor.
Background is a possible shortage of pharmacies: The evangelical Lutheran Church Hannover estimates that the number of its current number of pastors and pastors will be half by 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to decide the work and day-to-day course itself.
With Burfien, the country church first assigned a pastor to a full place to urge young people to study theology.
At the same time, less and less young people decide to study theology after the apricot.
Burfien points back to the process of reconciliation: "Good voice is slow, the world is loud".
The profession of great freedom and diversity has been devoted to this.
I am the Lord of my term calendar and can put my priorities there where it matters to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as self-carers.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well.
There will certainly be more to be paid in the free economy, but theologians would have been a safe employer.
This is against young people today, who are not only about careers but also about meaningful work.
According to the National Church, which comprises three quarters of the Netherlands, about 60 pastors go to peace each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study began their Victoria.
In thin border areas such as Harz, Emsland or Windland, it may become difficult in the future to occupy positions.
Burfien wants to organize other study days for young people and also invite prominent ones who have studied theology.
The Theology studio offers a wide range of training.
You can even be President of the Federation.
Country Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are rent seats and six-point doors as well as a free-screen facility.
The options range from enhanced brakes, a service package with the maintenance of Bowler works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle installation between events.
Drew Bowler, director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced runners, but people who are looking for pleasure and adventure as well as an accessible way to world class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format creates new opportunities to experience different Rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and to prepare innovations on the disciplines and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge cars – this will be a lasting masterpiece.
In addition, there is a training and testing day in February at the Defender Challenge, as well as the option to participate in the West Bank in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fire extinguisher called for the rescue of a cave, which is 15 metres above the ground on a dangerous foothold in a rock bridge
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby was running after a smaller traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a space traveler in a stone bridge in her misbehavior position.
Firemen slammed down on the sidewalk and saved the dog from safe death.
The fire was able to bring a hole in safety, which was fixed on a 15-metre high precipitation in a fieldway.
The nine months old cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby was born after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived alone three days before being rescued from a stone bridge on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, who belong to the dog, came to the stone bridge Flempit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to receive Ruby again and to thank the people of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had been suspicious of their missing hüdin and had published relief services in social networks when they ran out after the small traffic accident in the stone bridge.
About 14:15 in the middle of the week, a walker, who drove his dog out, saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-metre high hill in the rock bridge.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station took place and settled down to rescue Rubys, then transported to a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: “She was in a dangerous position.
It is located in the middle of the Felswand – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was as frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then freshened a few dogs.
That was a rather unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a giant accident."
It was the possibility that she was severely injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the zoo to be examined, but without creation and dehydration it was not established.
Becky Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “It was overwhelming to see salvation. ”
I couldn't even believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep them in the arms again.
The zoo said that if creation had become too large and they had been broken together, it would probably have been disturbed.
The firemen have made huge fires.
It was really brave what they did.
We are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely unbelievable.
Scott Alderson of Keighley added: “We were afraid that they would fall down, but they stayed up."
The firemen were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never noticed Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio player this week, the pop star said that she worked as a background singer to Jaggers Song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry explained that she had dinner with the altrocker at night and that “he encouraged me when I was 18”.
She added: "It's been here for a long time and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he “probably misses that he has ever had an approach test with Katy Perry.”
The representative added: “Maybe she has replaced him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest ride this year at the Rolling Stones Tour.

George Kerevan: European discount gives the shots the choice
A new day, a new history of independence.
This time we will be warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the record for stories about passport checks in Berwick and a secure border along the Hadrian wall with steel wire.
In fact, the Strathclyde proposal pointed to the possible economic advantages that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this – as expected – did not play a role in the fates.
Nor has anyone mentioned that the EU Member States often comply with their strict rules if it is more valuable to them.
Since Scotland does not currently belong to the Schengen area, the continued non-compliance with Brussels would only be a small resistance to what you really want from the shots.
So, actually, no story.
And one who has come so far in the year that it already looks like a fossil: the first time I've heard the "independence means passive control" end at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost at the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should you expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European fair?
Why does London's Joch fight that from Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan for the European Union after the war has been put in stock.
With the euro crisis, the project has officially died.
Over the EU, parties to land which are EU-friendly or would like to adopt the euro as a Community currency on board.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptical Party was able to vote in favour of Germany – firstly this year – with almost five million votes in the Federal elections in September and thus effectively expel the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Federal Day.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis appears to be a turning point.
Because of the strict savings policy of Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the commitment of the national economy, which is being used by the holding of the common currency, many people have the view that Europe’s project is too far off.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are causing excessive budgetary deficits – this was only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has established its members at exchange rates which are beneficial to German exporters – and the German politicians would like to be allowed to do so.
Without the possibility of an assessment of the local currency, South Europe will again meet with an integrated productivity evening against Germany.
The only possibility is to reduce wages and public expenditure – the competition of Berlin.
The current state and currency problems are a far deeper issue of European productivity.
As a result of the "green" energy policies organised by Brussels – a code for the subsidisation of French and German energy companies at consumer costs – the European industry is paying double for electricity and four times for gas.
This is an increasing part of the cost, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
The European petrochemical industry is not protected from being forced into the corner by cheap American skifers.
As a result, there is a revolution, especially in France, the only leader of the EU.
After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle with which Germany was held in Schach and Paris was able to raise its eyes with Washington.
However, Berlin no longer needs Paris as a forum for political legitimacy, and Europe has stressed its own economic policy, which has the French economy to fight.
The result: Marine Le Pens, EU enemy national Front, has just won a decisive election and thus refers the ruling Socialists to three.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the voter votes – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot go out of it, a column in the right spectrum would automatically mean advantages for the left.
What does Le Pen do with her new popularity among the white French working class?
She would like to use the EU elections next year to cut an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties are well cut off in these elections – and this is very possible – then the European Parliament could first dominate such a block.
This is the point that I would like to add: in the near future, the growing resensitivity against the EU and the common currency will be brought together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become something more like the 'Europe of the (superior) nations', the General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite companies may hold on to the euro, but France and South Europe will return to their own currencies.
I hope that the UK will distance itself from this project in the hope of joining the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific area is drawing attention to the fact that Britain will be alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where's Scotland staying with everyone?
We can decide to be a region of (last time) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – which is also part of telling Berlin and Brussels where they can hide.
I am convinced that Scotland could be very good in a closer European union if we keep our own money.
Cooperation with other, similar countries, is easier in a non-feeded Europe of the nations.
On the contrary, we should consider whether Norway is equal and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is, of course, the most successful political movement against the Spar policy in Europe, and in 2011 has gained a spectacular majority due to the rejection of the proposed (and proposed) cuts that the Minister of Finance Alistair Darling and the next Tory-Lib Dem coalition have been responsible for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide now for independence, only to be forced by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Faster Growth
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to achieve puberty more than their white parents, as studies show.
Physical changes do not necessarily mean puberty
There is no indication that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe the epidemic fatty life is an exhilarating of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN Correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter is already seven or eight years old with breasts and breasts?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida, the pedophile endocrineologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time with parents to calm down – normally it is not a sign that the puberty is coming in soon,” Kaplowitz explained.
Public displays of development, such as growing breasts, chest and shoulder hair, as well as body hair, are shown earlier in girls.
However, there was only a slight discontinuation in the age of the Menarche (representation of the first regular bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of breasts begins, it will take at least two to three years until Menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Press puberty in girls: The essential advisor to deal with this problem often."
Time is the exact test as the puberty progresses.
It is contrary to what actually represents the beginning of the puberty, but it is appropriate to “response” when the increase in breast milk is accompanied by an increase of eight years before age.
In most cases the process slows down or slows down – something that a child doctor can monitor exactly.
For faster progress tests may be shown by an endochronologist so that serious problems such as tumors or ulcers can be excluded.
There are treatments to delay early menstruation and other consequences: early ageing of the bones, which can eventually lead to loss of growth and thus lead to small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are directed at the age of the child, the development rate, growth rate and the emotional range.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is repeating what medicine is about, but he says: “The pressure of puberty can be a problem of behavior and the feelings of girls, other than their peers."
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their young daughters to have the period.
"They care about the risk of pregnancy or how they keep the hygiene side," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had received ten days.
Even if there were first signs and we had talked about Menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She got tired and left school at home because she was the first in her boyfriend's class.
There are many comprehensive theories published about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be harmful.
Boys come to puberty like girls before.
Caplowitz is the view that the most convincing premium is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls from six to nine years of age who developed a relationship between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African and Spanish girls tend to achieve puberty more than their white parents.
There are different explanations for this.
Global seems to be an early puberty of all possible things, from economic conditions over the climate to the genes.
Another suggestion: Although boys are already growing face and skin care, the trend to a full-time early puberty is not as pronounced in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference stress the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of Akne and Shamhaar is spread even in babies and young children.
"We need to be careful how we identify the real beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pedagogical endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to allow their child’s doctor to advise them on how to communicate with their child.
"This can mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected," Kaplowitz says.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who thrive early need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it comes into mind earlier.
Jumbo manufacturers fight for large commands about seat width
Among leading air carriers, it has come to a presentation of the wide range of seats in the tourist class at long-range flights, indicating the tone for a bit more contemporaneously on Dubai Airshow this month.
The fight is about the size of the seats that passengers are offered on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who try most of the airlines, but this dedicated space puts the key to efficiency considerations in the latest aircrafts of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co..
Airbus asked this week for a industry standard, which prescribes a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the American Esrival Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The replacement takes place at a time when aircraft manufacturers are required to sell even larger versions of their two-motor long-range flight, and are expected to hold records from 17 to 21 November.
As the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially if there are rows of nine or ten seats – it is crucial for the given economic results to deliver the new "Mini-Jumbo" design.
Boeing argues that his modernized "777X" stands 406 people in the tourist class who are over 17 degrees and allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competitive version of the A350 transports 350 persons in 18-inch wide seats in the tourist class, where there is nine per row.
Aircraft operators often share lifts over technical details by advertising in the press.
Airbus now calls on the public directly before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with more than 100 orders will be made.
Recently, the company presented an announcement that could be the beginning of a new advertising war and showed money suppliers a picture in which three people were sitting together in a restaurant, and the title was “Would you accept it?”
"Boeing proposes long-range flights in situ, which are closer than regional Turbo-Props," says Airbus CEO John Leahy.
In view of changed eating habits, people are thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 defined the modern long-range journey, and at the end of the century, the average American male weight increased by ten percent between 40 and 49 years, according to data from the US Ministry of Health.
In the 21st century, the figure of the average American male population is 100.8 cm according to American health statistics.
Airbus says his rival stayed on a seating concept from the 1950s when the average body weight of the freshly worn Jet Set was smaller.
Thus, Airbus conducted studies that suggested that an additional load (2.54 cm) per seat was higher by 53%.
Boeing insists on the numbers of Airbus to the seats and says that it is not in the manufacturer's estimation of how airlines designed the balance between flights and facilities.
The company also explains that according to studies, the experience in aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
"It really goes beyond giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to be successful," explains the flight cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate what makes them profit.
You know your business better than anyone else.
There is more freedom for passengers, but for manufacturers, it will be increasingly a subject that can affect sales.
Following the installation of the auction, a run for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollars at listed prices in the coming decades could have a sustainable impact on the US or Europe's export balance.
As Reuters reported in July for the first time, the seatout is the driving force behind the construction around the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claimed 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-motor long-distance signatures than the market leader in this segment, the 365-situated Boeing 77-300ER.
The statement of Boeings to the results partly depends on comparing the 777X with its 10 seats per row with the original design of nine seats in 777.
The increased costs per unit are still smaller than the machines currently used with ten seats per row.
"Boeing is therefore looking for more seats in his plane to make it more competitive to our products," says Kevin Keniston, Head of passenger comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s, pointed out that many passengers chose for the strict order what could be associated with cheaper flights.
"Twenty-inch seating would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat by the 777," says Mary Kirby, expert for cabin installation, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-wide Jet sellers even make band measures in order to monitor the installation in the field of competition.
Even if they offer comfort, all manufacturers also offer Jets with high-quality equipment for ticket flights and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-six rows, but according to its own statement no one has ever sold.
Until recently Airbus stressed the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered broad seats to the gangs for some Jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of a large modern Jet, experts say that the call may be delayed after a new industry standard, but it could break off from the well of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the use of the garage available when smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could destroy the pleasure of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could save a long life from nicotine use.
Prior to tests on humans, further testing is needed, which can last for a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from the Well Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
“We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers to stop and then try all the methods available on the market, but they had to experience that their nicotine search is stronger than these approaches,” said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified so that it contains genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively Infects the liver cells that then produce a constant flow of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker to experience no nicotine high.
In trials, infected mice treated with nicotin were able to contribute to their normal level of activity.
However, without interference, museums had taken a “outtime”, the researchers explained a sign that the nicotine had reached its brain.
The experiments are described in the science Translational Medicine section.
Early tobacco vaccines fail because they contain antibodies.
The vaccines should be administered so often to maintain the anti-cancer seal that they were expensive and ineffective.
However, the costs of the new vaccine are likely to be significantly lower, as it turns liver cells into anticancer factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for people could, if it's absolutely safe, be taken with children before trying to try a cigarette, and thus prevent nicotine research.
But it's more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
“Then they know that if they start smoking again, they feel no pleasure in the nicotine, and that helps them break the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi tends to be influenced by both
In contrast to former Labour Party minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, a statement is made by the State Corruption Survey.
The former NSW Minister wishes to have amended the provisions on maritime packaging, at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obaid, who has been involved in three basics on State-controlled land.
The Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) has extended its investigations on Friday to whether both countries' ministers have been directly affected by these agreements in the Circular Quay, where both restaurants and a coffee are operating without having to be extended after their departure in August 2005.
Now, because of the charge, Tripodi has been aware of the interest of both of them in the basics after the former Chief Chief of Staff, Mr. Lynne Ashpole, had spoken accordingly on Thursday.
In the annual talks that began in 2005, the Government had put pressure on public statements for the Covenants.
The parties were against it, and they also wanted longer periods of time.
In 2009, the contract contracts were extended to companies in the Circle Quay, which contributed $2.5 million each year without public disclosure.
Tripodi, who served as Minister of the Interior from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally spoken for public statements.
However, he contends that the changes have been made to the prayers of both parties, who, like Tripodi, had forced the government to redesign the passport arrangements.
One of the IAC's telephony magazine presented in August and September 2007 was the interview between both Ubaid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a leading officer who had been transferred to the Ministry of the sea after working under both of them in the Fisheries Authority.
“Who is the subject of the development of commercial contractual arrangements discussed in these telephone conversations?” asked Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," replied the Tripodi.
I can't remember what was said, but it was definitely not.
It's definitely not between me and Mr. Both.
Israeli combat aircraft target in Syria, such official sources
Israeli hunters had reached a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday, confirming a leading government employee against Fox News.
The officer did not explain what the target was, but said it was at least one.
According to Associated Press, it was aimed at Russian SA-125 rockets.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out air raids on rocket supplies in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas may be subject to "real test"
The Government is considering, under extended measures, an "real test" for foreign workers with 457 visas.
If the test is to be introduced, it should be based on a criterion to prevent the 457 use of unqualified jobs or as a backend for the training of family and friends to Australia.
Today a discussion proposal was published by the Government after the former members of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the Government's comments to foreign workers because they could be viewed as a source of guidance from the neighbouring Australians.
"Superious declarations such as 'foreigners should set themselves up' and 'Australian first' are a very unpleasant return in times where companies have called for a protected labour market," she told the Australian Institute of India today.
Historically, it was considered that white labour forces should be protected – and if some in the region remove an echo of this historical artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The debate proposal covers twelve measures that were first proposed by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who refused to talk about human rights in Sri Lanka yesterday, has implemented five of the proposed changes that will still be considered.
If the ‘true criterion’ is taken into account, a person requesting a visa may be able to verify at once whether ‘the application is true in the cases in which the applicant is connected with the holder or a relevant person of the subsidiary’.
Companies may also be obliged to calculate the number of 457 visa holders after hundreds of companies in the past have established, first and foremost, that would support only a small number of workers.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylant probably died on a heart attack after arriving this week with a flight boat on the Christmas table.
The lost nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him was cared for by a grown cousin who had been on the boat since his father's death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities brought the man to Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
A study was announced from the British Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to establish high-speed links between Scotland and northern England by the beginning of phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project "will bring Britain closer together".
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and the West Midlands.
After the end of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government adjusted the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and northern England from 32.7 billion dollars to 42.6 billion dollars.
The British Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further travel capacity and travel improvements for Nordengland and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel period of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is really a national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We go forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our network.
However, it is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will improve thanks to HS2.
Scottish State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is a good news for Scotland."
In the name of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown Carmichael called for the "inconsistencies" for the Scottish connection to the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail connection generates the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but also the economic strength of Scotland provides an argument for fast rail connections throughout the United Kingdom."
That is why we are pleased to work as partners of the British Government and explore the options for high-speed rail connections in Scotland, create the benefits for all and complement the Glasgov-Edinburg connection that the Scottish Government has already planned.
I am pleased to examine the investigation report with the British Ministers next year and to decide the next steps together.
Requirements for electronic devices in aircraft remain in force in Australia for a period of time
Australian flight passengers must also continue to turn off tablets and smartphones at startup and landing, despite efforts in the United States to block the provisions for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their priorities so that passengers on their devices can read, see or play videos, if they are in flight mode.
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do this, but many people find it embarrassing that they can't read their e-books at the start and the landing.
Australia's airlines have observed the decision to implement the U.S. airlines' integration to work, but they do not follow immediate plans to amend their rules.
The Authority also stated that the announcement will be considered, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia still apply.
‘The CASA currently has no specific rules on the use of electronic devices in the aircraft’, it was announced.
The subject is subject to provisions which following airlines maintain safety at all times and passengers must follow the safety instructions provided by the cabin staff.
Virginia has already discussed with the CASA about an extension of its Wi-Fi maintenance system to flights and explained that it is open to changes, but it has to be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the authorisation of electronic devices by the CASA, as we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we are now offering (free maintenance) during the flight," said one speaker.
It has been said that it will remain in the current rules until further notice.
"Our current directives provide that electronic devices should not be used at start-up and landing, and we do not currently have plans to change that," the company explained.
The FAO regulations apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers, and we will certainly see the FAA decision as well as the reasons behind it.
The decision is different in American societies every year after the fleet's age.
They need to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate malfunctions by mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand-packing programs and customer instruction.
“After a flight company has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, they can pass through the use of more portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, e-book reading devices and smartphones at all levels,” the FAA announced.
In rare cases in bad sight, the Crew will show the passengers while the equipment is off.
In addition, the group recommends that more difficult devices be placed and landing safely under the seat or in the luggage over the seats.
In front of the Revierderby vs Schalke, equipped BVB trailers equipped with light-traces for horse scenes in the Veltins-Arena.
Borusia Dortmund announced the consequences of this.
Before the game of the football Bundeslagi against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras first responded with a skiing.
It was an unusual, almost pensive acoustic, which was the focus of the viewer until shortly before the German Vizemeister Borusia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in the Iduna Park signal.
The guests with their beds were too much to hear.
On the contrary, where the most trusted of the faithful - and the most obedient - BVB fans were present at first, they presented themselves with extraordinary lies: no dreams, no beatings.
The Podst of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint fire, remained unworked.
And in front of the tribune, there was a big trap with the title "Section Stadium Ban".
Just as Torhüter Roman Weidenfaller as always as the first BVB player to play the place, a short-term jubel rose.
As his men's colleagues followed, there was loud singing and singing - but no longer everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern tribune there is nothing wrong.
Norbert Dickel also reported on the positive experiences of the last days - Derbysieg, victory over Arsenal, extension of the contract by trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not worry about holiday wages.
Just five minutes before the attack, the Capo broke his podest - and the hand-circuit pressure broke out in a low voice, as Dickel used to say, the voice on the corners of the stadium was asked.
Finally, as always, the south tribune was on the line - and finally was here again as the most popular place in the stadium.
And at least as soon as the South Tribune's attack, the loud urge "Debirths stand up" came, everything was as usual.
The shift before was probably a reaction to the events of the past day.
Right in front of Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the appropriate BVB trailers had fired in the audience lengths and on the spot - with almost torhuter Roman Weidenfaller.
The game was later hit because of the chaos scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tops of the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and it is believed that Watzke's words were a more unforgettable term for the fans.
"It will be given massive cuts for the entire ultrasound," announced the BVB-Boss on Thursday at a podium discussion in Frankfurt.
As a immediate action, Watzke told Ultras about a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
"I forbade that," he explained.
The zero tolerance policy in matters of pyrotechnics cannot be imposed.
In addition, the Ultras were shown various possibilities of punishment - up to the day of service they now have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, such a charge will be imposed by the BVB until the end of the following week.
"That's going to break up," security guards.
You may be excited about how the reactions on the southern side appear then.
Pfandhausen trees in Singapore, as the crisis has come in the Middle East
Janani Amirthalinga, in a Pfandhaus in the shopping center of the Bende sea in Singapore, offers a golden armreif, a ring and a few earrings to pay the fees of her daughter.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, because my whole money is spent," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 a month (about €1,730) as a management worker and her husband is working too, the monthly income is not enough, she explains.
In fact, the demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where the debt of households is incurred – is so great that ValueMax, where she has taken her bag, this week became the third pfandhaus, which is placed on the Singapore branch.
The deal of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollar in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but almost as valuable as an insecure bank loan.
Typically, Pfandhausen households in Singapore require an effective 17% annual rate, which is only about 15.4% of the United Overseas Bank, a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, Pfandhäusers offer the advantage that no verification of credit worth or income is required here, as it is possible that loans are faster than banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the Pfandhausen region are turning to Pfandhaus, after families are under pressure by rising living costs and increasing budget and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a tight financial policy in the developed economies, families with smaller and medium-income households are looking for a way to compare the difference between the current economy.
This week, the rating agency, Standard & Poor's growing budget debt, mainly through rising mortgages, was a risk factor for the credibility of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budgetary debt in Asia in terms of gross domestic product, after the Agency's assessment.
Malaysia stands at 80 percent of the GDP on the top of the list, an increase of 60 percent still in 2008.
People's economies are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has recently emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed an ongoing shortage of exports and an increase in consumer demand.
“In the end-effect it means that in view of higher costs people will be tried in the middle to the bottom segment (the income scale) to achieve their income wherever possible,” says Song Song Song Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historic high rates of gold prices in the last two years have strengthened the trend toward the pursuit of personal things, as people take advantage of the opportunity to transform the beauty of the family into Bargeld.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the condoms are in the 200 houses of the city of Gold.
People say, "The gold price looks good, let's get our Grandmother's chain of gold back in the next month."
The largest Thai panda operator, EasyMoney, has experienced 20 percent customer growth in its branches in the past months.
The growth in foot-and-mouth business is so strong that ValueMax, the operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to the nearby Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, manager of ValueMax.
The company finances the 60 per cent of Singapore's 66 million dollars this week with the arrival in Singapore.
While some creditors have been told that because of high interest rates in the crossfire, Yeah explains that pfandhäusers not only added more valuable interest than other sellers, but also did not raise the debts directly.
“Clients are attached to objects which they already own, and the flow of personal assets does not increase the budget breakdown,” she explains.
The loan business is increasingly accepted as a short-term, secure financing.
Nor are all people who take advantage of pets in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the branches of ValueMax to collect gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in bar.
We get customers from every social store.
“This includes beneficiaries who have recently leased something for a business or investment, or small companies that have to break the cash flow gap,” says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA protects data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The Secret Service Enthyller Edward Snowden has a primary interest in helping Germany to identify the increasingly deteriorating NSA-spaphazars.
Following the presentation of the Green Bundestags Agency, Hans-Christian Ströbele went to his surprise meeting with Snowden in Russia, under which conditions would be considered by the former secret servants in a German government or before a committee of inquiry.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, said the ARD magazine "Monorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for tasman health care
The Australian Government is faced with the harsh conditions associated with the rescue package of over $325 million for the Tasman health care package in order to ensure that the Government of the Federal State is not able to spend the money.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immortal measures" to address a crisis caused by an old population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and systemic restrictions.
The financing for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasman depute Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has cut off a emergency correction package which we see to be in line with the unique challenges faced by the Federal State," Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes 31 million grants for election services.
Other 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatment due to serious Star, should eliminate withdrawals.
In addition, there is money for day-care clinics in Hobart and Lanceston, better care for seasonal stays, vocational training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas of the clinical staff concerned to me, they are the best way to improve the Tasman health system," Tanya Plibersek said.
The Minister was responsible for a strict reporting and accounting obligation of the Tasmanian Government.
The Federal Republic of Germany must maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where additional funds have been spent.
A three-fold Commission will be set up and will ensure that health services are as effective and efficient as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the $325 million would be of little use if "they were not accompanied by real reforms that would bring the public health system to a more sustainable course."
In spite of this, he commended the Government for responding to its urgent request for assistance, which he first expressed against the Prime Minister in early May.
"I am confident that the Federal aid will make a great contribution to the public health system of the Federal State from the list of concerns," says Wilkie.
According to the Government of the Federal State, these elections will be widely implemented in the short term.
However, the political speaker of the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, is the view that today’s announcement is just a “plaster solution”.
"We are in the position today because the Labor Government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system," he said against ABC TV.
It cannot be that a government earns nearly half a billion dollars from the system and captures the Commonwealth 300 million and then acts as the good news.
Dutton called for Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the rescue package will be issued for additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Niclaux' adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot is convinced by extraordinary production equipment and contemporary details, however, it is also more difficult than necessary.
The story of Suzanne, a young teenager who is sent by her family to the monastery, tells the story of the 1760s act in France.
When she rebels, she is faced with the extreme gravity of an extremely sadistic oberin and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never leads to a loss of hearing or sensation – and it is a problem.
The celebration of the film also makes it a qualifier for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, so a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and gas ammunition facilities, the global monitoring group for chemical weapons on Thursday, while it came to a difficult meeting in the north of the country near one of the places where toxic substances must be stored.
Also on Thursday, a group of Syrian activists announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed three years before the civil war began.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the deadline
1 November, which was set up in the Hague by the Damascus Organization to destroy or "inoperable" all the facilities for the production of chemical weapons, including all the machinery for the mixing of chemicals to gas and the filling of ammunition.
The conclusion of this process, which is based on the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus must still start to destroy the existing weapons and equipment.
As a result, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including sanfgas and Nervengas Sarin.
The announcement came at a time when World Wars in Safira were fought on Thursday, the experts said that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and warehouses, as reported by the Syrian Human Rights Watch Centre in Britain.
On Thursday, 120,296 people were killed, the most active group, following the number of deaths on a network of activists in Syria.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the Government's side, 29,954 of them belonged to President Bashar Assad's army, 18.678 were government friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hisbollah militias.
Also among the deaths were 2,202 dissertated military soldiers and 5,375 opponents of the opposition, many of whom were foreign.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict to 100,000 since March 2011.
This number has not been updated yet.
The conflict forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assads troops have fought in Safira for weeks against the rebels, many of which have connections to al-Qaida groups.
The observation panel said that on Thursday, there was a loss on both sides, but no details were provided.
The wars undermine the risk posed by the chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to free Syria from its deadly arms race is a race against the time in the midst of a growing civil war.
According to the OPCW, which is closely working with the United Nations, the team should be “assuming that all important production and mix/fill facilities mentioned by Syria have been seen and destroyed.”
Therefore, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of the checks and visited 21 of the cities identified by Damascus.
Due to security concerns, the visit of two facilities was not possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC, which were both locations, stated that the Syrian declaration "was issued ... and that existing chemical weapons were destroyed at other so-called installations that were inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
"I shall draw the hat before the loss and courage you have shown in the performance of the most challenging mission carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director-General of the Monitoring Organization in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years, the main Sunni Muslim revolutions in this civil war have been fighting against Assad's government and its security forces, which belong to many members of the Alawite, have been a disintegration of the Schiitian Islam.
In view of further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was unknown, he explained.
Zorn on the judgment of Bali bomber
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who came to Bali's life in 2002 when the bombing was about to take place have reacted to the trial for the last of the defendants who were brought before the court because Umar Patek was supposed to be shot in a standard manner.
Patek, who had been one of the most sought-in-the-flight people, was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment for his role in the construction of explosive bodies for the bombing.
He could be released after 15 years of imprisonment.
The 45-year-old was convicted of mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
In addition, a claim was made in a number of terrorist charges, which included a wave of explosive attacks against the churches of Indonesia in the year 2000.
The government government had called for a life sentence, even if it was for the man who, because of his reputation as a master bomb farmer, could also be referred to as “Demolition Man”, who could have applied for death.
The decision has generated painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin brother, Jane and Jenny in the murder committed by Patek and his associates nearly ten years ago.
With trains fighting, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow the steps of the other core.
"He should be put in front of a divorce order," Cortés said against AAP.
I have to live every day so I won't get any more singles and I'll never see my daughter again.
The Sari Club was equaled to the ground floor, when a violent bomb exploded in a small tank that was parked before the night club on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide victim would explode a bomb-filled rocket.
After the attack, he fell into the coma for a month and “dead” three times, while sticking to a life-saving system.
Hughes said Patek had the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were arrested four years ago.
Indeed, this type should receive the death penalty in front of all others.
Let him live – no, there is no reason to let him live.
20 years after he killed 202 people and killed many hundreds, it's not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bomber who stood before the court.
He withdrew almost a decade of arrest, but finally in January 2011 he was arrested in the Pakistani city of Abbotabad, where US combat forces killed the former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden four months later.
During the negotiations, a FBI agent said that secret service reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan in order to meet the objective of re-establishing the link between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He didn't give up," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has not shown any sorrow about how much suffering he has added to others.
The judgment took place before the tenth anniversary of the attack in this year, which will begin with memorial celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be plenty of trains this year," said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Air guests can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not drive phone conversations)
Air traffic controllers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, music and watch movies from the distance to the landing, but do not telephone the new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
As soon as they were implemented, depending on the airline itself, FAA employee Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Air carriers must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight personnel’ training manuals and the provisions for the disposal of equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines that wanted to develop the use of electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
“In accordance with the plan, we could accept the increased use of electronic devices very quickly,” said the FAA in a statement of resignation.
At the moment passengers must turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft is closed.
They can only start again if the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain has green light.
When entering the country flight, the passengers must re-off and must not start again before the aircraft has been landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft were safe from electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at start, landing and on the role field, the FAA explained.
Most new transport vehicles and other aircraft that have been converted to larger levels of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional airline association, welcomed the changes.
“If the new arrangement is implemented safely – and we work closely with the airlines in this regard – both sides will benefit from it,” said Glading.
We are truly sorry to have to feel like a supervisor on this subject.
However, Internet connections to surf, exchanges of e-mails, text messages or download of data within three kilometres remain prohibited, the Authority explained.
Passengers are required to move smartphones, tablets and other devices into the flight mode.
So there is still no “Words With Friends”, the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone 2011 when he had to publicly leave a jet by American Airlines because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the plane.
And heavy devices such as laptops must also continue to be understood as there is a risk of damage if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile conversations during the flight also remain prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls is at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not at the FAA.
FAO may prohibit certain electronic devices from starting and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker, from the National Transport Safety Board, security experts for national transport issues on CBS News, would still be considered a risk.
“Handy is really a problem, not only because they may cause potential disturbances in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disrupt sendmasts," Rosenker said.
A advice committee of the industry, which was called by FAO to examine this subject in its life, recommends that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years the pressure on the FAA has increased to block restrictions on use.
Critics like democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri represent the view that there are no valid security grounds for the ban.
The restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult because the use of devices has become current.
In some studies, it is the phrase that forgets or ignores to a third of the passengers the turn off of the device.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by flying, after reports of disturbances by navigation and communication devices were reported by passengers who were then represented by the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than former generation of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that electronic interferences do not prevent them.
Flights offer passengers for several years Wi-Fi when the flight altitude is reached.
The pilots adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also sensitive to interferences.
The overwhelming majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the stronger use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices are generally significantly less functional than earlier generations.
E-reader, for example, only provides minimal radiation when you turn around.
However, when downloading or sending data, transmission values are stronger.
For the closure of the restrictions on the use of devices by passengers, Amazon.com counts.
In 2011 companies played a full passenger plane full of kids e-reader and made a test flight to detect problems, but they could not determine.
Members of the FAO Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd from the passenger association National Association of Airlines said that he was the view that the interference by the devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other Committee members said that only detailed reports were given by pilots who spoke for the destruction of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them were very old.
The Committee, however, recommends that FAO allow pilots, in the event of a misbehavior, to order the removal of the devices by passengers in the event of a loss of vision.
A group from the travel sector welcomed the changes and referred to them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers who would be equipped with technical equipment today.
"We are pleased that the FAO recognises that a pleasant passenger experience is not a threat to safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Rehabilitated bird by the North Sea Bohrinsel air navigation service
An air navigation service on the coast of flying birds, which was created on a North Sea coast, was re-located into nature.
The water cycle was launched last month with a hijacker to Aberdeen, where it was launched by the Scottish animal protection organization SPCA in its rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, director of the Centre, said: “This water cycle was probably a winter bird from northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently the created bird sought access to the nest.
He added: “He could no longer fly, because we were contacted with the request for help."
At their release, the water cycle was cool and healthy again.
Is Europe's Elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was started in April with the aim of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who want to change our relations with the EU in Britain would like to see.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov asked over 1,000 leading forces from the economy, which represented about the UK sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be surprising.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are exporting abroad from Europe and focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the countries are advancing in the EU.
They want new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil to be promoted by government side to continue with the long and intensive process of reforming the obscenity of EU institutions.
In the light of their view, the majority of economic leaders are required to retain control of these key competences in the Westminster, from the Charter Law to the Law of Product.
There was widespread dissatisfaction over the internal market, as according to the company's statement, the costs of Brussels's rules would be outweighed by the advantages of being part of Europe's trade zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed to the most traditional ones in Europe.
Finally, and in most cases, our question of economic leaders has been raised that a significant majority of the UK wants a course to change the agreement and not a relationship with the EU based on trade, which is not political.
This knowledge found at companies of all sizes and leading companies shows that the economy is pushing for a "intensive change" that brings the burden of trade back to Britain.
It is too much – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would result in a 16% change of opinion in favour of the EU's stay in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this question shows that the British economy is behind his plan to negotiate the new British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant deterioration of power relations from a renegotiation to the UK.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and to a greater extent necessary after the euro area is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the outcome of our survey shows, which means a stronger focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulations.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom named Pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gasra
The construction of the South Stream Pipeline in Bulgaria is the start of one of the largest European energy projects, explained the Gazprom.
"Today's event is a milestone: the construction of the Bulgarian South Stream Gaspipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said the president of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, on Thursday in a statement.
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended to provide more diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between the gasprom and its pendants in Ukraine, in which most of the Russian gas for Europe is stored, is concerned about an increased risk of conventional routes, such as to be heard by official sides.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “always” excluded.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream to benefit from the entire project in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work should begin in other developed countries on the planned route for the year.
The pipeline is equipped with an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of earth gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way forward to the real estate site Germany.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees charged with charges against Jonathan Lord for sexual offenders
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) have been accused of sexual abuse in connection with children, prior to 2011 cases against childcare provider Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as the Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse of Children has experienced.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA stated that "there has never been a case of sexual abuse of children in the organization".
Business leader Phillip Hare was asked about a case where a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography, and another, where a sports teacher at YMCA Caringbah Hall 1991 was convicted of abuse of children.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the lawyers who assisted the Commission, was aware of the first case but did not know the second.
He noted that the opening statement of YMCA against the Commission had also been somewhat in the opinion of the Commission, "has given external checks of YMCA, in which YMCA was recognised as the first front for the safety of children".
Evidence before the Commission shows more that the YMCA has been informed that it received the second-rate evaluation of four possible quality audits of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with the YMCA 21, said that the business leader had failed to "beg me" when he was appointed by Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the child safety directives.
Lord was condemned at the beginning of the year for sexual misconduct in twelve boys during his two-year YMCA activity.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
However, Hare argues that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that the staff member had to refrain from reporting to Lords abuses in relation to the safety of children.
The staff said that they had observed abuses, including that Lord was alone with children, that they cared privately as babysitter, that they were sitting on his shirt, that they said he loved it, and that children were playing with his phone.
Danielle Okkwell, whose predecessor Lord was and who had prayed for child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, said that child servant Jacqui Barnat, who at YMCA Caringbah, was “very charming and most of the time very approachable”.
The manager explained that he would not accept statements from employees, why they would not have been trusted to replace their proposed message.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord had affected their ability to judge, for which they had not informed him.
Hare explained that he informed the board of YMCA NSW that the lesson to be drawn from the "Jonathan-Lord's accident" was "not the report" by employees, and the board approved it.
Hare said that the decision to force employees to sign secret obligations shortly after the charges were filed was taken by the business leader of the YMCA Children's Service, Liam Whitley.
He said that in order to prevent the contamination of the evidence, what was "extremely" and badly used should be avoided.
The YMCA NSW, while Jonathan Lord worked there between 2009 and 2011, was not a safe organisation for children, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, expert on sexual abuse of children, the Commission.
He explained that there were "serious problems" in setting up, checking, processing, training and monitoring of staff.
The hearing was suspended until 20 December.
Tony Blair explained that he would use the chance to return as British Prime Minister – but it suggests that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the fifth anniversary of his departure from the office, 59-year-olds shared his views on various domestic policy issues.
Since his return in June 2007, after a decade as Head of State, Blair has largely refused to expose himself to British politics, and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as messenger of the Quartet of the Peace Charter in the Middle East.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair was quoted from London's Evening Standard as saying: "Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this is happening, so..."
When the horse-shaw experts arrived in Scharen in Cardiff to see the horse of the year, they were aware that a tough competition was taking place.
But no one was prepared for the three years old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not yet in the children's garden and only a few months ago, took his first step, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee hit the locker through the three rounds and held the first price – where they left 30 adults behind.
The inseparable couple, both equally large, were admitted to the annual competition, which is organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he was in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had set up his countermouses in a cool corner and led the two years old toppled through the ring.
Fenton was awarded by the jury for his natural abilities in dealing with the Pony, which is far above his age.
And Toffee received best notes for his behavior and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift to his third birthday and had enjoyed every day with Shetland-Pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee are a great effort."
They had to stand against the entire field of participation and went off with goldpokal and Rosette.
It was the second time that he had participated in a competition with Tofee, and we were all excited when he won.
A perfect stranger in the Arena held him so romantic that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows the footsteps of his Aunt Sharon Howells, who has been riding horses for more than ten years.
Howells told me: "The whole audience was as electricized and everyone burned it and burned it."
He loved sand the entire length of the Arena, and although he looked so wild, he worked fantastically.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farmers and has two chickens to take care of.
As he started, it won't last long until he's on the "Fair of the Year" stage – and I'm sure he'll be cut off well.
One speaker of the annual horse - drawn drama said: “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together they're a great team.
The jury assessed Fenton and Toffee after how well they had fought and presented themselves in the lead.
They focused on good cooperation between Pony and the leader – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fentons' sweet dress has contributed to their part, which really fits perfectly for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be "reformed" after call
A Chinese newspaper, which had requested the release of a reporter who was accused of diffamination, was to be reformed, explained a press regulator.
The New Express in Guangzhou had published a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later explained in the television that he had taken over his pensions to fake reports on a subsidiary company.
The new expression will now be subject to a "abstaining rectification", the regulatory authority explained.
The “recordification order” was issued by the Government for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Previous findings showed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inappropriate reports on the listed company zoom million between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The edition management of the New Express was not organized," the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said that she had decided to "stop an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporting licence".
In addition, "the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to propose a complete rectification of the New Express and recommend that the relevant responsibilities be identified in the New Express and to check the New Express's lead team immediately."
Chen had written several articles for the new expression in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machinery named Zoomion.
After his arrest, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the title card and set up behind his journalism work.
But then Chen appeared on the state television and said he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoom million as well as the entire press industry and its ability to gain confidence in the public," he explained against the CCTV reporter.
I did it first because I was out of money and money.
I've made it clear that I've been wrong.
In connection with Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the title card and explained that it was wrong to check the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently withdrawn from TV.
Experts say that situations are still routinely forced, despite a legislative amendment in the beginning of the year in which the authorities were banned, to force someone to blame himself.
Drug tunnel with its own railway between the United States and Mexico
One of the most refined tunnels for the drug exchange between the United States and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, heating and electric railway operation, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities describe the 120-time 90-centimeter-measuring tunnel as one of the most missed passages they've ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the circus pattern over a length of nearly six football fields, connects storage halls near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area, there are taxable storage halls that make it easier to hide drugs-based LWWs.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported there, the authorities explained.
In the discovery of the tunnel, Marihuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine have been secured to the rear of the tunnel, so the records of the court have been recorded.
Three men who, according to the statements of the authorities as drivers, were charged with possession and sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They are sentenced to ten years in prison and for life.
In Nogales, Arizona, Schmuggler sets on an extended underground network of drain channels.
The tunnel is the rear large passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered after the Marihuana spring in central Mexico in October, which puts the drug cartels ahead of the challenge of how they can quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640 meters long pass with skis, which enjoyed two warehouses in San Diego from a kitchen in a house in Tijuana.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love themselves
Players Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
Player Orlando Bloom has made a distinction between his wife, the top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, who was supposed to be released on Friday (the second time), Bloom said that "life sometimes doesn't go exactly as we plan or expect".
Time and again, he still loved himself, stressed the 36 years.
"We will support each other and love them as parents of Flynn."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
Veganism is the subject of vegetarianism according to Lexika, but differs from it in a very important way.
Because while vegetarians allow the consumption of saunas, ice or a powerful edamer, these bees are not on the food map of a veganer.
Milk, cheese, eggs, in addition to the fat on meat and fish, the Veganer can be removed from the whole consumption of animal products - also honey will be removed.
What remains remains may be asked, but in a closer consideration, the poor food world is characterized by a considerable impact.
"Brotaustrache are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of this reform house, who produces a number of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the loading in the domgasse.
For 13 years the bourgeois New Zealander has lived in Vegan, in Lampertheim (fastly) discovers everything he needs for life. "In 1997 I put my food around and became a vegetarian".
The next step took place in the centuries, and I became a Veganer.
"The conviction came not only because of food, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, the artist leader normally prefers leather.
He recognized that it is also in other everyday interests without animal products.
In the first line, Vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," said Proctor to the maximum of the vegans, who are focused on the whole consumer behavior.
Instead of trusting citizens, drivers or rubber bars behind, the Veganer soon discovered all new products, the enthusiasm grew.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "actually, vegan doesn't make any mistake, it's no cheese, but it's a range." The assumption that with the diet approach, reducing the choice of food options leads to the power of the habit.
And that is exactly what these conditions allowed some to make such a good joint effort.
"The search factor is a very decisive factor that makes many rise quickly, like smoking," says Proctor.
And it says, "A certain hunters are not to be caught by the animals."
Often it is the jewelry or the type of preparation that tastes.
"But you can also produce the same effect in other ways," explains the Veganer.
For example, Proctor brings Aubergines, Champignons, and also a few Veganwürsts.
It focuses on a balanced, varied diet where it should taste perfectly once again.
Of course you want something between teeth, that's legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but it's not just to reduce animal food," said Proctor.
He has not suffered from health damage to food disturbances, a further widespread adoption.
For me, the transformation had a positive aspect.
I don't take a foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin component.
There are high-performance salads that only eat vegan.
"My blood values are best, I'll check often," explains Proctor.
In particular, many vegansimus critics warn against vitamin B12 deficiency.
"As animals are consumed with food instead of burning on the surface, it is asked whether in the meat that is bought in the refrigerator, the vitamin B12 share is high," says Proctor.
It also allows Veganer to take coenzym in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are okay," he explains.
Prototor must not go far for food production.
There are basic food products everywhere and each supermarket has a medium-term soya milk and other products.
Everything I need, I'll find a place.
Just leave and I'll buy something special.
"Many people think that even the finished products are expensive, but that is how they are known for "normal" finished products."
In addition, the preparation of vegan courts would be much more cost-effective and less timely than generally accepted.
"In the kitchen there is much to discover, with a few small holes you can do well if you don't achieve some better results," says Proctor.
Margaryne instead of Butter, a little more copper and carbonic acid instead of Ei, with his vegan cheese can also bring Proctor to the stage with his skiers.
The Veganer's family party gives a new joke.
It's dynamic when you buy it together, it's a new position value.
"The situations that can arise are as different as humans themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, he has also been opposed by the Skeptics.
Don't you taste my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - on such questions you should act as a vegan with a fingertip.
"I don't give up on people, I'm part of this company," Proctor doesn't want to delay the enclavedase.
And more precisely, the world of every day does not appear to be as dangerous as it is - and the vegan is not as restricted as it is in common.
Fast food is also allowed.
Pommes is everywhere!
"Many Danubes offer falafel, or even a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he weighs on pasta dishes, or even orders a pizza without cheese, all a question of the habit.
The restaurants are so slow about it.
"When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, everything was even harder," the New Zealander may conclude a development: "I have to talk to the people to make them pay attention."
"If enough questions come up, they may be tired of finding the food card," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop, for example, the combuses in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor points out the desire that other restaurants also have at least one vegan court on the food map.
On the basis of this, there are judgments for all of them.
Everyone can eat, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"In contrast, meat rights are exclusive, and although in the true sense of the word, they close others," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make the greatest part of it impossible," says Proctor.
However, the purchase of vegan products may be somewhat difficult at first.
In particular, if one learns that animal additives can also be included in soils as colorizers, it seems to leave the mind quickly with the pursuit of ethics in so many ears and fall.
Not only did Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen write a book: "Vaganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives" explain the many ingredients, but the food-but also cleaning products are added.
"After and after you have developed a scanner view and you know what signs and logos you have to watch "It is sometimes better to take small steps than to stay or to stand," says Proctor.
Veganism, it is an important moral sign of the fingers, which focuses on consciousness.
Maybe he doesn't make it all the way up to his habits, but at least he can teach the consumers to question his habits critically.
The employer Nasdaq OMX keeps his customers in Atem.
The trade on Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday in German time.
In a communication, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven US options markets, including two of Nasdaq OMX, kept their business unhindered.
The most recent incident is that a whole series of smaller and larger panties continue with the drill operator.
Only on Tuesday did the indexes of Nasdaq due to errors in data transport were counted for an hour.
In August of this year, it had given only two pounds a week.
Firstly, the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs had sent in the option market for technical problems with massive miscellaneous purchase orders.
In addition, the drill operators needed almost a whole day to check and track the orders.
Two days later, half of the entire stock trade in the United States came due to a computer panel at the Nasdaq exchange for several hours.
In addition, in the past year, Facebook had provided for viewing.
The Nasdaq systems had not increased the flow of procurement and sales contracts, later determined the SEC survey and turned the company into a record fine of $10 million.
Constance: Radler runs 63-years around
The accident was reported by the police when a 26-year-old man at Donnerstagbend, at 22 hours, was on the left side of the train station in the direction of the market.
As suddenly a 63-year-old man from a place on the bridge, the driver said the police could no longer be on time.
At the next meeting, the footstepper was pressed against the wall of the house, went on to the ground, and a length of about 15 inches [15 cm] turned into the head.
A rescue team brought the victims to the clinic for medical treatment.
British police make Assange a delivery decision
The British police have today handed over a delivery order to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian message in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that the 40-year-old Australian had a "request to make himself" that required him to appear in a police uniform, and added, he should not follow him, he should be arrested.
Assange claims the delivery to Sweden because of the charge in a sexual case after his possibilities have been issued according to British law, since the Supreme Court has rejected his claim against the delivery of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would deliver it to the United States, on June 19th, he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian message in London and prayed for political asylum in South America.
Scotland Yard has "a 40-year-old man has been asked to make himself at a time chosen by us," one speaker said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The message did not comment on the police requirement.
Assange fears that he will be delivered from Sweden to the United States and there he will be accused of possible spying after publishing over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website.
A driver who was placed between the legs with 210 km/h and hot drinks will receive £1,000 penalty
A car driver was sentenced to a fine of £1,000 because he was driving up to 210 km/h and a drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was arrested on May 27, with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police arrested him, they discovered the drinker between his legs.
Before the Colchester Court of Justice, Howie was known to be guilty, without being aware of the need for care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
In addition, the payment of costs of 90 £ and an offer of 100 £ were judged.
Tax for foreign real estate owners against London speculation sheet
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision by Schatzkanzler George Osborne, who, in the budget 2012, had a tax of 7% on housing, which costs over two million dollars and annual charges for buyers, housing as a company and not as a single person.
The revenue from the stamp tax for residential property in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea regions, which was estimated at 708 million pounds in the year 2012/13, is now greater than the revenue for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: "After the increase in the stamp tax on high-priority housing and the introduction of the related legislation against an environment, it can be hard to assume that high-quality properties can be low, regardless of the effects of the old Community tax system."
"However, this step could make some foreign investors withdraw, as regards the purchase of real estate in London, or the sale of ownership from it," he added.
First-class real estates – the top five to ten percent of the housing market at price – in the prosperous London Southwest corner, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, have grown around the record value of 11.8% in the last year.
The prices in Central London showed an average annual growth of 5.6 %, but a growing domestic market, on which the western part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5 %) experienced an upward trend, was examined by Savills.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the relationship of a dog's jaw with its voice.
Previous studies have shown that happy dogs with the swan increased to the right (from the view of the dog), while it was the left side of nerve dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can see and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Valortigara, a neurologist at Trient University, said: “It is well known that left and right brain cells react differently to stimuli, which stimulates positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to see this with other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just as in humans, the right brains are responsible for the movement of the left side and turn around, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the side effects of their species, researchers monitor the animals while these films are seen by other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analysed the behaviour.
We'll probably soon understand why the swan once into one, sometimes into the other direction.
Professor Valortigara said: “We have shown the dog films with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate some other aspects, and thus we were able to control the movement of the sword on the left or on the right."
When the animals see how an otherwise unexpressed dog has moved the dragon to the right (see from the perspective of the wild dog), they remain completely relieved.
But the decline was mainly left to the left (again from the perspective of the dog, who gives birth), so their heart rate increased and they seemed uncomfortable.
According to Professor Valortigara, dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
He is more convinced that the dogs had learned from experience what movements they should worry about and when not.
He said: “If you have different encounters with other dogs and the vendetta is linked to the weakness in a direction rather than friendly behavior and the right side produces less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences."
Researchers say that the findings of dog owners, animal doctors and trainers could help to better understand the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, expert in dog behavior and guest scholarship at the University of Bristol University of Animal Health, explained that this was not the first study to be examined whether it was important for dogs to the left and right.
Last year a team of Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they see an aggressive dog and to the right when it's about a satisfying dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following were: “Stop going to a robot dog, if it’s , turn left and not right, instead of being uncomfortable – exactly different from in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could lead to the fact that dogs in the various studies did not interpret animals in movies or robotic dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“Although there are considerable grounds for many different mammals to use both brain cells for different purposes, many of the details must be determined – and dogs do not make any exceptions,” says Bradshaw.
Since your behavior is simply to be recorded, it probably won't last long until we understand why the joke sometimes moves into one, sometimes into the other direction.
Arctic Monkeys move event in Glasgow due to the disease Alex Turners
The Rockband Arctic Monkeys has moved an event into Glasgow after her lead singer has been injured in keel head injuries.
The band from Sheffield should play in the hydro on Friday.
However, due to the disease of the lead singer Alex Turner, the concert must now be postponed.
The announcement of the band came after she had already had to leave an event in the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on her official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to make the show in LG Arena in Birmingham tonight, as well as on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also take the show in the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1. ”
"In Alex Turner's case, a headache was diagnosed, which is why he can't appear."
The show in the LG Arena in Birmingham is now located on 20 November, which was transferred to the Hydro in Glasgow on 21 November.
Keep all tickets for this show's validity.
We apologize to all the owners of the ticket for the inconveniences caused by this.
Please contact the customer service at the mall where you have bought your ticket if you need further support.
Pope Francis appointed the first cardinal in February
Pope Francis will be called the new cardinals of the Catholic Church on 22 February, as the Vatican was known on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are also those who choose a pope so that Franciskus will be named the first group of men who will eventually be affected by the election of his followers.
There are currently 201 cardboards.
However, a cardinal who has reached an age of 80 can no longer take part in the papal election – this is a group of 120 “chosen cardinals”.
In a statement in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a speaker of the Vatican, said that a meeting of all cardinals would take place before the ceremony would be held for the appointment of the new cardinals, also known as the consistory.
"Papst Franziskus has decided to give his decision to introduce the constitution in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals would probably have fallen by February.
He explained that a pope normally named as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of eligible cardinals would be returned to 120, and as many cardinals as he wished.
The composition in the next year is therefore important because it has been the first since the election of Franciscus in March this year, so Valero.
At present, there is a certain overlap between Europe and, in particular, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will be called cardinals from the rest of the world to restore equality," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they only have a victorious number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Cardinals Council established by France to find a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the mandate to reform the church.
In the past, the pope decided everything by himself.
"Now France has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He explained that it was “good possible” that Francis asked the cardinals for advice.
But before that, we were not in this position – this is all new.
Valero said that typically the bishops would be called from large places to cardinals, but the Frenchman "studently surprised – so we don't know who he is named".
GM calls new pickup tricks back in the United States to repair the seat
General Motors called almost 19,000 of his new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks with construction year 2014 to address a problem with the manually arranged seating, so a communication from the U.S. Air Safety Authority on Friday.
For some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for the return of the advance loan.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Road Safety Guidelines.
“If the rear of the vehicle is located, it is possible that the head protection is not properly protected, so that there is an increased risk of injury,” was read on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The models returned were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and is the most important model start of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owner in the first half of October about the defect.
The NHTSA could not verify the notification letters due to the 16-day government Shuttdowns, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sale of Silverado and Sierra Tricks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, has increased by 20 per cent in the first ten months of the year, explained GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42.660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM share increased by 1.4 percent to 37.47 US dollars on Friday afternoon at the New York Stock Exchange.
Double-declining depreciation [d]
I have chosen President Obama twice in hopes that change will be possible.
He says Obama has made commendable efforts, which have been accompanied by the Republicans' blockadetics.
The blockade policy does not blame Obamacare's website problems, the dropdowns
Obama's memories of the 2008 election struggle were a sad memory of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year.
I'm reading a terrible book.
It is a book that I believed would bring me back to life during the last two years of my medical study and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and depicts Barack Obama's memoirs in the 2008 presidential election.
If I'm finished with my patients' papers tonight and go to bed, then the book brings me back to a time when the politicians were inspired by millions and they were able to talk to the breath.
The election was held by a spy and news reporter in order to convey the historical significance of this hour in front of the eyes.
My classroom cameras were filled with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready to change.
When Obama moved to the office in 2008, he had 82% consent.
And then I closed the book.
Reacting to the present is a bad awakening as if you're being taken out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be an empty memory, a sad obstacle to missed opportunities.
In the years since I voted for the first time, something has really changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and varied things that Obama has achieved from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Disease Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced disappearance of homosexuality in the army and the murder of Osama bin Ladens.
I also believe that the political blockadetics have made many efforts to bring our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay to name only a few.
However, after I have repeatedly defended the Obama government against colleagues and acquaintances, I have come to the end with my explanations.
I have reached a point of political uncertainty.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is permitted to hear foreign state officials or to kill innocent children by means of drugs in excess.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans and why Whistblower is punished, who exposes the state’s misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen of the United States, was murdered without proceedings, or why public funding and expenditure limits are being applied during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report in which it means that the efforts of the White House to calm the media were “the most aggressive... since the Nixon Government”.
And at least it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website for more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
I should have understood with 18 that the government's work could contradict its previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the honourable Member is not in a predictable position, as a party of opposition and occasional events like the Newtown Masker engage in the public discussion.
But when I look at the examples mentioned above, they seem to be widely chosen by the government itself.
And that's the most disturbing of me.
I chose Obama again in 2012 because I was interested in his candidate.
With Romney presented a confusing and unambiguous alternative, he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression, a second office time for Obama, free from the pressure of future choices, would fill the hope we had heard so long ago.
However, with the decline of the agreed values for Obama below 45 % this week, the return to 2008 has become more difficult by this book.
I look forward to seeing the many promises that have been resolved in the air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to hide a serious loss against Clinton at the options in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the electors after the decision, he told his staff that they had to come back to the course and follow the purpose of their case.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr President, and I couldn't approve of you more strongly.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer, Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest at parental leave
The billionaire and Deputy Prime Minister Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughter could become pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mountain-builder, who is in a court case of the payment of 6 million dollars on CO2 taxes, raised the argument when he wanted to ask whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision whether CO2 and mountain taxes are cut or cut.
However, Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughter of Abbott would benefit personally from the laws.
"He is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when a daughter becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets a leave," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Election Commission announced 53 votes in favour after the renumbering officially won the Fairfax Sunshine Coast seat.
Palmer called for a revision of the voting process to allow this process to go faster.
Tony Abbotts daughter Frances and Bridget.
Whether these choices should be selected two months after the end of the vote.
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system where you re-enter the data into a computer immediately and then have the result at 6:30 p.m.?
Palmer also criticized the use of flashlights when marking the voting list.
Do you use it because you can sort out the results if you don't like one?
It is unbelievable today to agree with the wishes of the bride.
The election committee has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, stated that his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office “very seriously”.
At a public office, it's about public service.
"We do not seek any reward other than history, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this Community," he said.
RBS suspends two devices
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from its currency division, two people who are confident of the situation; this is another indication that the world's official disclosure to the required manipulations on the currency market is rapidly taking place.
Some of the world's largest banks, including U.S., Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in the world's largest financial market, to exchange the owners on a daily basis $5.3 billion.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees who were suspended in the extensive investigation, the scandal surrounding the Libor-Interbank business.
The Bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information from authorities.
"Our findings on this issue go further and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
In the last month, the following persons reported that the RBS forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to an earlier dealer to the British supervisory authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and should have been authorised, between his current position as European leader of the Forex Spot deal at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European Spot Trading at Citi, was released this week and Matt Gardiner, former leading currency dealer at Barclays and U.S., was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these dealers have been suspected of any misconduct.
Bankers at Barclays and the Citi group were among the instant message groups of Usher, saying the situation was close.
It was announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authorities had declared that it was investigating a possible manipulation of the currency market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six world authorities – the European Commission, Finland, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with the preamble to which banks should have engaged in transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received requests from authorities, said people who were trusted in the situation.
Banks received instant messages and e-mails from several years to search for cases of misconduct.
The news about these investigations has moved traders in a range of redundancy, which has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because low volume in currency limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to take off the fairs and said that it was almost impossible to manipulate the extended and high-quality liquid currency market, but leading dealers are the view that this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume in retail trade, the fragmenting of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of its own internal platforms by banks would lead to “suddenly low ticket prices can affect the market”.
The message came out the same day as Credit Suisse was announced this week by a dealer of her London Exchanged Fund Offices, after he had lost almost six million dollars last year.
The Bank immediately informs the competent authorities and works with them.
"We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter has been reduced," said Credit Suisse.
Builds the building on the base of the building
A group of citizens' initiatives "Swiss show" has decorated the building on the concrete floor at the curpromenade in Bad Hernealb.
In addition, she cleaned up and spread the path, which is in a press release.
The planned covering of the falling house in the back of the plot was not allowed for safety reasons, as the land was soon to be cut off.
Alfred Abel, who now manages the plot, had spoken with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the BI action, a transparent with the message "We are for it" was introduced.
However, some 20 members of the citizens' initiative were less involved in their actions.
Her motto was "We're against the boroughs."
So they wanted to point out the danger of even greater ruin on the Swiss way - the rice project should be broken up one day.
In conversation with many passengers before the construction site, it was clear that some citizens believe that there will be a lot better with the implementation of the city's projects, although there are not few questions like the size of the project presented.
But they start to re-sign because the city continues to increase these answers, it is on the side of the BI.
As it was to be heard, the public statements of the mayor are also true.
May had said in the Community meeting that he feared the threat to the thermal bath, the people should vote in favour of the plans for a bath and wellness complex in Switzerland.
Some appear to be just shy, others feel like "pumping pressure test" to the population, which means that the press release of the BI continues.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all aids.
Rangenick Shelter for Schiris: Manne no Swalben King
So satisfied Ralf Rankick with the current high-ranking form of the Bundesligi-Table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the "Bullen" was disappointed.
"There is now a dangerous trend to pressure Mane and Alan into the category of Swalben Kings," he took the two OffensiveWirders on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg in protection.
The youngest event for Rankicks Criticism was for Mane at 3:0 against Grödig on the last Sunday, when the Senegalese read a play which was allegedly linked - it was not free of charge, as the TV images showed.
"A great decision of error", said Rankick, the judge of the judge Harkam, called "completely obsessed".
Harkam would also have contributed his part to the esklation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-trainer Adi Hütter after the party.
He defended his German Landsmann, saying: "I would have treated myself as Roger Schmidt did in every situation."
Schmidt himself wants to have no contact with his colleagues after the screenshot with Hütter.
I didn't know why.
"Because I am the one who was trained," stressed the 46-year-old.
In view of the success of the success race, however, the rank agreed on a lobby.
"There are only two words for this: really good," he said.
There's not much to do.
Especially the way the man plays is impressive.
That's how it's supposed to go.
There will be hardly any changes in the winter transition.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"In addition to the desire for a player to leave the union," Rankick pointed out.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's health law
It is a great victory for the Obama government: the U.S. Supreme Court today decided that the health law relating to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judge ruled that the patient's individual mandate to protect and preventable Care Act – it is mandatory for US citizens to conclude a health insurance by 2014 or to pay a penalty – within the framework of the State's authority.
The chief judge, John Roberts, fought on the side of the four liberal members of the chamber, while the judges of Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided to do so.
The Court also confirmed the other sections of the 2700-page legislation and also expressed the view that the standard of health law, whether the state of the state should extend access to medicine or, in addition, all state medical requirements, would not be restrictive.
The complaint procedure against the law was enforced by 26 federal states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 elections.
Norway: Norwegian place is made with rice mirrors Light
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian Ortchen brought light into her dark valley.
Due to the low Sunni fall rate, the Rjukan from Herbst to Spring is usually reduced in the shadow of the surrounding mountains.
Three giant reflectors in 45 meters high became a century-long space on Wednesday.
"End!" said Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the launch ceremony on TV2.
Some of the talent residents turned to sunglasses, others set for safety because of sunglasses.
Until then, sunhungers had to ride in the winter with a sailboat on a nearby hill.
Ten years ago local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to link the beams with mirrors into the hall.
But it has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city has finally adopted the 5 million kroner (about EUR 615 000) thine project.
A similar construction takes place several years ago in the Italian Alps of Viganella.
Posts are almost Sundays
"Many citizens have not yet noticed that the red points for the solar eclipse are still on the various letters of the city and parts of the city, but you read the little print on the yellow contents of the Post AG, you will soon find that the discharge on Sundays and holidays is no longer taking place," explains the FDP.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays, only before the post building in the Ernst-Ludwig Street 36 and in the Jakob-Müller Street 1 will be taught in Hüttenfeld.
Whether it is taught in Hofheim and Rosengarten on Sunday will not be answered in the answer to the FDP's question.
The social and youth political speaker of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow up here.
The Sunday service is just an important post service at the end of the day.
"This company, despite the price increase for letters in January 2013, is radically and irrefutable."
Thomas Bittner, president of the Liberals' Group and Urban Association, supports his colleagues: "What I regret is the fact that the learning times have been changed in secret or are being thrown down here."
The post is distanced from the public area.
"At least the letter boxes in the towns of Neuscloß and Rosengarten must be taught again on Sunday," said Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisano.
In addition to the core city, particularly non-mobile citizens had to be able to obtain a letter box with solar control.
Röhrenbeck asked the City Parliament whether the city administration was planning discussions with the post on this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lambertheim.
But his knowledge also provides a sunset in Hofheim.
Your party has already spoken for privatizations.
"Then decisions will be made elsewhere," said Mayer.
Frankfurter parking charges should rise strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
Today, the city's mayor tells of a presentation by Mr. Stefan Majer (Greece).
The parking charges should therefore be increased by 50 per cent.
However, the prices should not be raised, but the interval of parking and parking cars should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, then, the City Council must decide.
The IHK Frankfurt Single Trade Committee maintains the "no good idea".
The possibility of parking immediately before the business is "a non-estimable advantage for smaller dealers".
The transport club Germany is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is "appropriately appropriate and actually excessive".
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Freudunstadt: Quick Skip Actions Guests
With a small frame, the gentlemen of the TSV Freudun city in the Schiller School Hall in Reutlingen had to appear against the TG Gönningen from the Swiss Alb.
However, the apples stood with an experienced man on the other side.
But soon it turned out that she, even older, could not fully cope with the rapid actions of the townspeople .
With the hard and positioned climbs, Gönninger was extremely difficult.
Repeatedly they missed the steps and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Edward Schulz clean through the network and were not in place at the lockdown.
Two of the first high courts highlighted the superiority of the city of spirits in all matters.
In view of this oppressive and decisive performance, the third sentence was then gained something smooth and smooth to 3:0 (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
There will be a significantly stronger enemy on the field on 2 November with the TV Baiersbrunn, who was able to pass through in Nagold.
TSV Freudunstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-class, the two men from Baiersbrunn and Freuden City were against the wall hall in Baiersbrunn.
They delivered a hard two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides resulted mainly in errors and punctuation; also during the steps, the precision of dual mangeware and in some critical stages of play prevented the transition from looking for possible points.
In this highly balanced encounter, however, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto agreed through great physical use and a satisfactory commitment of both teams.
day care at the small English hospital
On the mid-fifth day following the Natura 2000 Hotzenwald project, a group of engaged participants met at the small English hospital in Ibach.
In view of allegations from the population that day should be cut off in the area of the halls of the hall in the valley, Mayor Helmut Kaiser said.
Many tourists, such as Kaiser, have named this area as the smooth piece of the castle, where the landscape offers the ideal framework for magnificent performances.
He thanked the people for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of duty would be an appropriate instrument to strengthen the link between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to place accents in nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, environmental considerations can be taken into account.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukit from the Department of Natural Protection of the Freiburg government Bureau in connection with the welcome by Landrate Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the screen management and wanted a good reputation.
The tourist objective of the wide view is to meet the objective of Tribuaite, with the aim of obtaining, among the highly advanced old public areas, its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the existing ways.
Certain species, such as rare schmetterlings and grachipfers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections for maintenance.
Tribuatit said that she did not want to waste it on this site to break a land for the planned biofuel area.
In this plan, the current measure is not only a matter of urgency.
A biospheric area also offers the chance of sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of the internationally recognized Unesco status and therefore a continuous addition to the life project and the past days of the past.
After these different executions, Revierletor Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff shared the help in groups.
The larger trees had already been hit in advance, the forest climber was ready if necessary.
A group of relief workers should be concerned about the release of wacholderbücks and the maintenance of a dry stone wall.
The goal was the free view of the point of view.
Openings: Buyer still only one candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Bararstadchen Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a future school, child, youth and senior policy, as well as their own city works as attractive, no second citizen candidate has yet been registered.
As the only candidate for the follow-up of the candidate mayor, Norbert Brugger, from age to age, is the 46-year-old banker and business lawyer Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen.
The application deadline runs on Monday, 11 November, at 18 hours.
Google, Samsung, Huawei for Nortel patents
On Thursday, the group, which had thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a file of complaints on behalf of patent abuse against phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was banned by Nortel's insolvency extension.
Rockstar, the Consortium that the North patent had purchased for 4.5 billion US dollars, accused Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent violations before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is considered in seven cases of patent damage.
The patents refer to technology that brings search terms into line with relevant advertising on the Internet, so the complaint that comes to the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC place phones that work with Google's operating system Android, which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of over $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer multiple times and last hit 4.4 billion US dollars.
After it was banned in the North patents of Rockstar, Google Motorola Mobility acquired $12.5 billion, a business that was also motivated by Motorola Library to patents.
"Although Google has broken up with his attempt to acquire the complainants at the auction, Google has damaged the patents and continues to do so," the complainant wrote.
Rockstar demands a high level of damage from Google, as it claims that Google's patent damage is objective, so the charge.
Egypt defends the first freely elected Presidents
Mohammed Mursi leaves the office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political struggles in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he was declared the first freely elected president of the country and thus suffered the consequences of Husni Mubarak, who was expelled from the office 16 months earlier.
With the introduction of his office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth Head of State since the beginning of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He left the Eid before the 18 judges of the court dressed in black robe, who had his seat on the Nile and found an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We look forward to a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic," said Mursi at the festival ceremony, which was transferred to the public television.
"Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer and member of the Muslim brotherhood in the United States, a fundamentalist group that has been taken mostly as a banned organization since its establishment 84 years ago by the respective government.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guards the building, when Mursi entered a small car car shortly after 11 hours.
Only a few hundred people had gathered before the court to join the new presidents, and instead of the presidial spring from the Mubarak time, the traffic was held only for a short time, so that the bus could cross the streets normally occupied by the city center to the south.
As the uncharistic "extraordinary" of the brotherhood, his personal prestige has taken place since his victory and a free date, in which he has not only been a candidate of the Islamic, but all of whom presented themselves to pursue the efforts of the rebellion in 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” explained Mursi, dressed in a blue dress with red tie, to the judges in the wooded room in which he laid the office.
Later Mursi went to Cairo University, where he was supposed to keep his entrance line.
He was officially welcomed by an army officer who played the national gymnasium, which he belonged to in Habacht.
The military leader Hussein Tantawi was present.
When he arrived, he was welcomed by hundreds of guests at the largest hearing hall of the University with speakers from “The Army and the people are one hand”.
The University of Cairo, founded as the base of secular education in 1908, developed into a group of Islamic students in the 1970s.
On Friday, Mursi left a symbolic seat on the Tahir Square, the birthplace of the revolt, which led to the end of the authoritarian kingdom of Mubaraks, and he believed that he would demand the presidial powers that the military court had taken from the Head of State of the Office.
However, with the refusal of the official office before the court and not as usual before the Parliament, he respects the military's desire to continue the struggle of power.
Mursis speech on the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides for two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberg Discothek "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On today's Friday day, it's called "Pump this party", on Saturday morning it goes on with a Ü 25-party.
Fat Beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers of course on two days.
Workers were beaten by leaders: seriously injured
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg was beaten by a leader and severely injured.
The man from Lamprecht House wanted to exchange a defective sense of heating at the outside of a guest house.
When he went up to the leader of the Dachrine, he pulled off the road and the man jumped on the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was brought with the rescuer "Christophorus 6" into the Landesbanken house of Salzburg.
Violence in South Africa: Two Lifelong Seas
Nine months after the brutal rape and rape of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrators were sentenced to two life-long sentences on Friday.
This was reported by the SABC sender.
The victim later died from the consequences of serious injuries.
Johannes Kana was already found at the beginning of the week of the crime to be guilty.
The act had resolved all over the country.
By the time he was 21 years old, Anene Boysen had been raped in a industrial area near the capital city of Bredasdorp in February.
14 And the priests fought for the life of the sacrifice: but they departed.
The view of young people was so shocking that nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had agreed during the process to be in a bar at night with Boys.
He also tried to beat them and rape them, but he tried to be responsible for the death of the girl.
At first, the police were excommunicated from several tattoos, but two suspects left the prison because the evidence against them did not suffice.
The government also stressed during the procedure that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Violence is almost daily in South Africa: annually there are about 64 000 ads because of sexual violence.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, it has a significant population of more people than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa appreciate the dark figure in sexual violence, but on the 10th to 25th.
Jumbo Visits the Black Forest
Jumbo on the search for the "best gifts of the world": For the TV broadcast "Gallileo" the Pro7 Star Bondorf visited.
The speaker also makes it clear at the beginning: The most important thing for the gifts are the snowflakes, turbomast is not a good condition.
Can the gift you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
As head of the large chain factory in Blackwood, Jumbo explains how the company "Adler" works in Bondorf.
"Germany's favorite gifts," as Jumbo announces the Black Forests' gifts.
Only with hair protection and kittel he comes into the factory.
Jumbo must also wash his hands first before he can touch the microwave.
Jumbo for fast-acting in Waldshut
"This will work for me a lot," the television maker, black forester Schinken as a mass product.
16,000 cables per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fatty parts, color: Uli explains why it comes to quality.
Most pigs are beaten with six months.
Watching the level?
Also details such as the Ph-value of the flesh play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the p-value.
"That's what I'm excited about when you're Roberto Blanco, what happens then," says Jumbo.
Here the level of private television is presented in Reincultural.
But the visit is still worth it.
The viewer sees that the setting of the cables is still working.
Because: Black forests are traditionally found without bones in the regular.
The secret of the gift is the blending with the salt.
Smoking tower and smoking fire, Jumbo remembers optically on a "U-boot".
The trick: Dental teeth here provide the special taste of the black forest.
20 days in smoke make the snow almost black.
"Now the ship disappears in Jumbo," he announces the test upgrade.
"That's really nice," said the TV star's fake.
All participants will be able to live.
Did you think travel offices belong to the Internet thanks to the past?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has increased its profits for the year as a whole and is expected to receive recordings of passengers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel company now spends between 325 million and 340 million dollars on a refined annual income before taxes, compared with 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous forecast.
When the current target values are achieved, it means an increase of 12 to 17 per cent compared to the record gain of 290.4 million dollars in the 2011/12 period.
As business leader Graham Turner announced, the Flight Centre won eight percent in the first half of the year and bought a strong start in the second half of the year, especially in the Australian and British private business.
"From the beginning of the year, our ten countries are profitable and some of them are on a good path towards record revenue before interest and taxes," he explained.
This includes Australia and Britain, which typically belong to our strongest outputs.
In Australia, the leisure industry has gained in the second half of the year, which is a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, it was good for the Flight Centre's leisure business in the UK, while here the business customers also paid less.
The U.S. business recovered from the season's weak first half year, so a profit for the third year will be expected for the year as a whole.
The shares of Flight Centre rise by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Schools will focus too much on mathematics, legislation and grammar
In English literature courses students will have to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, Romantic Lyric and contemporary British novels since 1914.
The test also contains “inseparable texts” entry to appeal to wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
From 2015 students have to start a custom GCSE test for language, where there is strong incentive to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new educational plans for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first stages that have been radically redesigned.
Other cores will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Offqual, the audit supervisor, is known for a new organisation of the GCSE structures, including a new system of use and less short-term work.
In a speech in the summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is a "wide consensus that we need to reform our testing system in order to restore public confidence", stressing that GCSEs would become “more challenging, ambitious and stricter”.
Studies show that in English schools there is less time for mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries.
In contrast, teaching Australian schools averages 143 hours per year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours a year.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the hour plan, the comprehensive math examination – combined with a stronger weight of the professional in the range list – will probably encourage schools to set more hours.
The learning plan focuses more on "responsibility problems", including financial thematics.
Lock beautiful animals and beautiful torso

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ökumenian Forum
At the next Ökumenian Forum on Monday, 21 October, at the new museum of the castle it is about the theme "To Hell with the Hell - Theological Reviews for Today's Treatment with the Last Things".
The rapporteur is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Öcumenical Speech Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Churches of Salem, the castle of Salem and the Cultural Undersea.
Johanna Rahner wants to follow in the forum of the question of how today people will bring in the "last things" after death.
If people in the past century had known too much about it and put it on those images of heaven and hell, "which are still our imaginations", then the contemporary prophetic teachings of the hopes for fulfillment are more marked by a certain delay or even a lack of speech.
"The greatest hope is that Christians and Christians have been excommunicated by the religious criticism," says the referendum.
She has provided us with so many questionnaires that we seem to be keeping the call signs."
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the crucial challenge remains the care of death."
To this end, the question is linked to the search, "the dream of being able to do everything well at the end."
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the Albert-Ludwigs University Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She promoted 1997 to Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecomenian Theology followed the University of Westphalia in 2003.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has entered a course for systematic theology at the Institute for Catholic Theology of the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Little Heuberg confirm their faith in the company
In two services of God, 101 15-year-olds and 16-year-olds of the soul care unit were established at Smallen Heuberg.
The Service of God accompanied the Laudato-Si group on the afternoon of youth The Spirit.
With the approval of the firm, the young people said yes to their baptism and experienced the power of the Holy Spirit.
The companies had prepared themselves in the past months, under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and with the assistance of numerous members of the Community on the big festival day.
In various projects, they learned various tasks of Christian community life and shared experiences of youth in subjugation.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race desired participants
At great weather, 214 passengers arrived to Illmensee to manage the course over the hills around the sea.
This is part of Ulrich Knobel from the organised sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants, in particular at the short distance of more than 15 kilometres and 300 heights, there were a number of iron wheels that her Hobby once wanted to perform in the competition atmosphere.
Two young drivers of the German top class were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Lenz came with the recommendation of good locations at the German masterries.
Both of them were expected to leave the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small amount of time and defend his title as a short-term winner.
On two occasions, Pascal was able to place himself again.
At the ladies theresa Duelli was from the team Albtraum, which created it all up on victory points.
In place two and three came Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Treiber from Oweningen.
A happy development is the growing number of drivers living or working in the community.
Not only with regard to performance, the whole band size was represented by athletes.
The age structure also grew from 10 years to over 70 years in the oldest starters.
In the main course of this year, there were more absolute topballs at the start.
Four drivers were able to get rid of the regional top drivers.
Among them is Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black-Tusk-Racing team.
Pangerl was with a team colleague already twice the world champion in twelve hours.
In this year he became a European master in this special discipline.
With this, too, Roland Ballerstadt, who has already named himself two German masters in Duathlon.
After 45 kilometres and 900 altitudes, it came to a Wipernschlag final in the course of the three-sea Hall.
Pangerl fell first over the target.
Only one second later could the Routinier Ballerstadt ensure the second place in the overall assessment.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann became the third of the overall assessment.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race.
The second place was to secure Area Blersch from binwagen before Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sportsers and helpers showed themselves very satisfied with the smooth and well-organised departure of the event.
Roads through slamming, fluids and dschungel for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bülle brings free medical help in elegant villages in Cameroon
Belle and his team spend almost every week to treat hundreds of patients.
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people.
Log out here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Belle belongs to Top 10 of the "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in Top 10 to select him as "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years George Belle saw his sick father lose consciousness and travel to hospitals that didn't have the means to help him.
James Belle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
First, he had only a broken arm, but then he formed a disintegration that spread to his brain and caused a haematoma that should affect him for the rest of his life.
"There was no neurochirgen in Cameroon," said Georges Belle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Belle spent years accompanying his father to complete clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," commented Belle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first and not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed since Belles Father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, such as the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the ratio in the United States is in the hands of a doctor for 413 people.
But even if it was given to them by a doctor, most Cameroonans could not visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three quarters of the country's health expenditure are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Belle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his countrymen suffered to see in Belle the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Belle and his volunteer team have conducted 700 free operations in the last year.
He became a doctor himself and worked as a nurse at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
In addition, he established a community organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas for weeks and offers free medical care.
Since 2008 he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday he and up to 30 people go to small buses and drive with the broken medical equipment on the roof over unencumbered land into the villages that need help.
Everything doesn't always go smoothly.
More than once, they had to drive the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be received as heroes: a festival, song and dance and the best accommodation to offer the place.
In these villages, free medical care is indeed a reason for the celebration and the bell – with its wide spaces and its unlimited energy – is pleased with the joyous celebration.
The next morning the team will then begin with the investigation of hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people by driving," said Belle.
They come from an area of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekly clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, undernourished, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crests, broken glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is necessary for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team carries out simple operations with local training.
The operations usually take place in a school, the hall or a apartment; after the attack the patients are up and go to the reception area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is stored by the group's generator and so does the bell and its volunteers to the early morning hours on Sunday.
It's an intense thought, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
"They wake up all night, so we can stay awake and continue our work," says Belle.
On Sunday the team goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has performed 700 free operations in the last year and knows that it causes a huge difference to the people it helps with its work.
One man explained that the free operation of a service bridge he was receiving now enables him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to weekly clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Belle also works at private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his community-based activity, so well; the rest comes from private spending.
“I don’t really know when he sleeps,” says Katie O'Malley, who studied at the Drexel University in Philadelphia Medicine in the second year and volunteerly worked in Belles Group.
He's always in the hospital or trying to spend money on the organization so he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and health professionals such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Belle, this is a chance to collect practical experiences that they would never get to home.
"We can be at operations where we help, shed blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Belle," O'Malley explains.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay their travel to Cameroon themselves and often bring expensive health materials.
But if they are first in Yaoundé, Belle takes over the transportation, transport and guidance.
"He is certainly a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no limits.
For Belle, the almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to lead a happier life and thus fulfilling a promise that he has made to his Father brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this work," says Belle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to bring people back to tears and to relieve the pain.

Explicitly mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway Novelle "The Old Man and the Sea," is Horst Janson cut off on the body.
Janson himself is an old haze in his metal, play art.
The old man Santiago can't do anything at fishing.
So they're just great.
You're sure to be able to see the fall in the neck of the old man who speaks of the fishing boy Manolo.
If Santiago is tired of life sitting on the table, that's true with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a characteristic role that Janson is highly mastered.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who did not give up and finally won the fight against the fish by his knowledge and his willpower.
Janson is in a wide range as the sole manufacturer at the stage.
He created it to focus the attention of the audience on itself, so that his monologues are not a moment long.
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the observers forget that the sea consists only of blue-lighted water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann allows the old man in the boat to act before the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he focuses on each active scene: the Hüte of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who has the life feeling of Cuba with her song and great voice.
The four musicians play Cubas Rhythmus and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: Rise to the Romans
About 120 meters long is a water channel from the time of Rome from below Cologne.
Whoever visits Cologne won't pass through the court.
About 157 meters, the two towers fall into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
However, few visitors who attend the two philanthropic churches do not know that there is a lot to discover under the court.
Rainer Schulze is expert in matters of Kolner Underworld.
The service centre of Koln-Tourism is directly at the court.
The tour starts completely unexpected: "We're in the deep garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city’s fathers wanted a self - righteous city, so the rest of the old city walls remained only what was not too big.
That is why most users of the parking lot are also passing through the rest of the Roman Empire today, leaving their car alone.
However, who is more careful, in Parkdeck D2 discovers an archeological base that is decorated with metal-gitter steel.
To see, there are about five meters high ruins of hand-held stones.
"There are the remains of the Roman city walls built in the second half of the first century after Christ," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to the daylight, Schulze allows the participants to throw a look into a window, 15 meters deep.
This is the source of the old domain, which will soon be taken away.
The next station of the round is the Pratium, and here the participants climb down into the depths again.
Here we experience the office of the first powerful man north of the Alps, the president of the CCAA.
What the CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation is for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippiensium", which in good German means as much as "The City of Roman Law and the City of the Agrippines, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the worship of the emperor".
And at the Pretoria it is about the former State Palace, the power centre of the Roman Empire at the Rhine.
From the front of the exhibition, a tunnel access to the Roman water channel, which is located around 120 metres long.
"You can quietly take a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want," said the students to the guests.
A surprise still has lessons.
After holding the key at the box, he leads the group to a 16-metre deep, attractive boat.
"We are now in Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep in the ground to get to the groundwater that was essential for ritual washing.
To this day, at the bottom of the Mikwe, their origins go back to the back of the century, different water conditions are acceptable by changing the surface of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archeological zone at the railway station for which construction work should begin soon.
Until the end, however, a few more years will pass.
Nearly cut leg: new surface of Rocker process
A bloody attack in Rockermilieu will be re-registered after more than four years.
A process of attempted death, hazardous bodily injury and damage against two 30-year-olds has begun before the Frankfurt (Oder) District Court.
It is accompanied by strict safety precautions.
The appellants fail to register.
They should have been active in the rock scene and had been part of the bandidos at the time.
In June 2009, they were invited to enter and enter a car together with unknown complexes in Finowfurt.
All the victims were severely injured, a man had almost lost his leg.
The victims should have belonged to the competitive group Hells Angels.
One should be a high-ranking member from Berlin.
Previously, it seemed like a persecution race with multiple cars.
According to a complaint, it was a revier fight and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were released in early 2012 in a first procedure.
At that time, a judge said that it was not possible to prove that the men were actually involved in the bloodshed.
The targets had worn masks and were not recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice held the judgment after the revision of the State Administration and referred it back to the Land Court for further discussion.
One of the defendants is now due to another delictate in the open suit.
In particular, it was about the reconstruction of the operations at night.
As a witness, the Commissioner who was present at that time was charged.
In the center were telephone conversations between the defendants and other persons who had listened to the police.
It is difficult for Rocker to stand before the court almost always on a previous law for them - and not to look at it.
That's also true of the victim.
In the first process, only one of the victims had been packaged.
State Law Stefan Golfier from Frankfurt State Lawyer (Oder) said on demand that new traces have been discovered since the last procedure.
For the process, eleven more negotiations are proposed.
The company does not think
The night was long, the music sounded and the mood was good, but sometimes it goes home.
Only: In the books of the people on the back and back seat, the hunger becomes noticeable.
Of course, one or more cocktails or sects may be responsible for this!
What's more important than driving to the next drive in order to get a little lower?
I think I'd like to see it when it's going to the fast-food hall late in the morning.
A couple of pumps, a cola, a bourgeois - and then nothing like home and bed!
But the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco players are noticeable on the wall.
Because what has to be wrong if you regularly throw out your fast-food girls from the car window?!
In particular, the weekend is a distance from road borders and parking spaces.
"Well?" I ask.
Are the people too busy to take the girls with their home to the next miller?
It's not just that the paper product divides the landscape.
Ties have already covered transport facilities such as guide planes and have solved accidents.
This is what "competitive society" means, but no longer, perhaps it does not even know what this word really means.
If you're on your way by night, just with several people in the car, you know how a back bank can look after spent nights: clamotes, bottles and other furniture.
There would be a few more or less holes - in contrast to the street, where no one wants to jump on the rest of the other.
I can see that the day will come when the cities and communities will be in a state-of-the-art mood - and the fast-food chains will have to be demanded for their stupid feet.
Obama's return to health policy
Following harsh criticism, President Obama repeatedly repeated a return visit yesterday, making clear promises: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of letters of resignation from their insurance insurance policy were received, the Republicans presented to the President in the last days, and he persecuted the U.S. public.
Yesterday Obama relativized his original promise.
"The overwhelming majority of citizens who have a functional health insurance can keep them," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the many media reports, Obama asked those Americans who received such communications to look at the free market for a new insurance.
Most citizens could receive better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or price as forecasted.
"They come with a better offer," he said.
It was little surprising to the Government that the five percent of the people who have made themselves an insurance had to look at a different rate, since their contract did not conform to the new standards under the defunct Care Act.
"I want to tell these Americans exactly: you deserve better," said Sebelius at a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the representative House in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Acts, stated that the start of the online platform has been “miserable” since October.
"I am also frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
This statement made by Sebelius to a councillor behind her sitting at the hearing in the representative's house was taken up after a dispute with the Republican representative Billy Long from Missouri. It was about whether she should be obliged to take part in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeated with the question why the “architectin” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily refuse a State-enforced insurance to end a fee at HealthCare.gov, which they now want to sell to millions of Americans.
The Government in Jerusalem does not confirm an attack on the Syrian Air Force
An American government officer who wanted to remain anonymous, on Thursday accused the US messenger CNN of being attacked by Israeli warplanes one day before an Air Force Base in Syrian Latakia.
The aim was to be "racets and related equipment" from which the Israeli government feared that they were destined for the Lebanese Hesbollah, according to CNN.
The Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab Ambassador Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the support point in the port city of Latakia had been attacked on Thursday night, and Israel was responsible for it.
The Israeli TV channel 2 showed satellite images of the support point in Latakia, where Russian reconnaissance rockets of type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 rockets were to be seen, the channel 2 has a range of 35 kilometres and can transport pumpheads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The Government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency also quotes an anonymous Israeli government officer with the words he believes Israel has carried out the attack, but it is not safe.
A speaker from the Israeli Defence Ministry said anyway: "We do not comment on these reports".
Journalist Ron Ben-Yisha stressed in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime has already tried to deliver land air rockets to the Hisbollah.
The Israeli Government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to provide the Hasbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant that the passage of a "red line" meant that a military response would follow.
John Kerry explains in an unambiguous opinion that the US spies were “unsuitable to go far”
John Kerry pointed out with an unexpected opinion an increase in the United States' disparity with regard to its monitoring programmes, saying that in certain cases the spying was “inexhaustible.”
In addition, the Foreign Minister, together with Barack Obama, took the responsibility for turning on "Autopilot" when the explosive findings of the Whistler Edward Snowden about the NSA's spy activities were published.
Through the secure information, the U.S. government has been driven into a diplomatic stream of equipment by its allies.
At a video link to the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: “Without question, the President and I, as well as others in the government, have experienced some things that have been done almost via Autopilot, simply because the ability to do what is still at the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War, and of course on September 11th."
He then said as a top member of the US government that the US spy had exceeded a limit, but also stressed that no rights had been violated.
He said: "In some cases it is inappropriate to go far."
The President has decided to create clarity and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that this is a mistake.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people are not affected in this process.
Kerry, however, was convinced that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved through its monitoring processes.
He added: “We have to do it with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves into the air."
There's a radical extremism in the world that's about killing people, throwing them into the air and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to take it off and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented aircraft accidents, attacks on buildings and the killing of people, because we have experienced such plans in advance.
In addition, US lawmakers will travel to Europe to express their concerns about the alleged American spying and to convince Europe of the need to continue to cooperate with the US in the anti-terrorist efforts, as stated by the President of the Senate Committee on European Affairs on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he had talked this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other people and was concerned about their threats to participate in anti-terrorist organizations because of the frustration over monitoring by the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that the Europeans remain in view of our joint efforts against terrorism on board," Murphy, who is first sitting in the Senate and acting as Chairman of the Senate Committee on External Relations and European Affairs, said in an interview in Washington.
In addition, I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their doctor over the NSA programmes.
Media reports, where the NSA has estimated millions of telephone data in Europe, have charged relations with some U.S. allies, although the leader of the secret service said this week that the reports were inappropriate and based on a misunderstanding of metadata collected by NATO associations and exchanged with the United States.
Other submissions from Snowden quoted documents that the NSA had monitored the phone of Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other state capitals worldwide.
The leader of the National Secret Service, James Clapper, defended the spying with allies as necessary and explained this to be common on both sides.
In all the Tumult, Murphy, his authority, prepared the trip to the convention to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating agencies should be published in the following days.
He said the exact route will still be worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some “first words”.
He said that the European governments must be honest with their people about the type of spy programs they have used for years.
"While we can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect European rights, these must also be found in the fact that we are not the only ones who spy on them," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a trip to the Middle East and to Poland on the weekend to combine with the Groll about the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US-American monitoring activities.
A heart attack on the spring line prevents the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga outdoor game of the FSV Mainz 05 at the FC Augsburg.
Mainz calls for the use of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he'll try to practice with the men.
So far, he could only do it individually.
"We will soon decide on his use," said Coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best to protect with six hits.
Because the Mainzers have already to ignore the affected performanceists Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australia vs. prison sentences in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket prison because she had falsely claimed to be raped by a taxi driver, was sentenced to appeal and was released on bail.
At first, Stevie Rochelle Bamford was found by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June to have made a false charge after she told the Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped her on Sunday, June 10th, while two other men arrested her.
Later, however, the recording of a video camera showed that she was safe in her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket held Bamford for two days until she was able to reflect on the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a port facility with low security levels at the Pukets border, instead of in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who has turned to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks explained against the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney, the whole family was “extremely concerned” about his daughter’s welfare and wanted her back to Australia.
“We are naturally worried, but we hope that she will be home as soon as possible,” said Tunks.
Bamford has filed an appeal against the court and is against a bailout of 50,000 passengers on a free foot.
In Australian reports she was to read that she is holidaying in the middle of the holiday resort Krabi in South Thailand.
The court heard that Bamford would be represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the profession could also lead to a higher punishment of up to two years in prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that Thailand, following the recent assassination of Mrs. Michelle Smith in Phuket, might be trying to improve its attached tourist image, and that is why it becomes a free speech.
