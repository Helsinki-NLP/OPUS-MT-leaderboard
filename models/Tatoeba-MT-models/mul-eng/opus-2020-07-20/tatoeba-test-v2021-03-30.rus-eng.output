I can't explain it to you.
He's afraid of dogs.
There was a girl at dinner.
I didn't know you had a girl.
How did you get the impression on Tom?
Why does he hate me?
It's enough to scare him.
He knows her from high school.
Tom made it look like nothing happened.
I promised myself I'd smoke.
Stay here with them.
The accident didn't even cost him his life.
He dug the bottle.
We're home already.
You haven't returned those books yet?
I met him at the club.
I didn't agree.
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
I hope you won't take me for a second.
What are you so secretive?
You're just running away from life's problems.
Smell the snow.
When did you see her?
I've been waiting for you for three hours.
I lost the exam.
Eat until it's hot.
So it took three hours.
What are you offering me?
Tom thinks Maria's an idiot.
I told him to wait for me.
I couldn't answer all the questions.
I didn't know you were coming too.
Last week, I went to Boston to Tom.
Tom's beautiful.
Tom didn't know that Mary likes to prepare.
I told him you were busy.
Tom was surprised to see Mary in Boston.
Do you want the anecdotes?
I wanted to do more.
Tom is our best pilot.
Are you sure you know what you need to do?
I can't just ignore him.
She's going to school on a bicycle.
I'm crying now!
Do you want a seat for the roll?
I've been busy all day yesterday.
They're hostages.
Under the table was the coins.
She's leaving.
Help the window.
Don't think I didn't try.
You stay here.
Tom risked his life to save Mary.
The caravan of fifty-squares moved smoothly through the desert.
You should be ashamed of your privacy.
I've changed places with Tom.
Tom went to the park alone.
You're a teacher, aren't you?
I won't try to convince you.
I knew Tom was losing.
Tom told Mary he wanted to drink.
What are you fooling about?
Tom didn't tell me how he's gonna get in touch.
Didn't I tell you that I had allergy on the aisles?
I know how old you are.
I won't show it to anyone anymore.
Tom won't sell his house.
I didn't want to hurt Tom.
I'm teaching you.
I've got food.
He came to her.
I wouldn't do that.
Tom tried to seduce Mary.
I decided to try again.
Tom won't let you win any more.
The cosmonauts are wearing shoes.
Algeria is buying artillery weapons in Russia.
Tell him what happened?
Give me something.
Why should Tom apologize?
The results were shocking.
This room is empty.
Tom sent Mary a telegram.
We're in Germany!
We spent the night under the open sky.
Don't shut the door.
When are you free?
Isn't that supposed to be October 20th?
I have to go to work now.
Who is this woman?
I want to talk to you about this report.
When does it start?
Obesity is one of the five senses.
What's wrong with you?
They're afraid of him.
Tom's on the job.
There's something hiding from us.
He didn't even touch him.
You've already given a name for the newborn?
I want you to help me with my homework.
I'm not a specialist.
I'm sick of him.
I like Brazil, but I still go to Ukraine.
I've prepared you for breakfast.
I didn't think you'd let me do that.
I see Tom almost every day after school.
The poor man could be corrected.
Sop a hot one, it's impossible.
Why is she so popular?
They declared their innocence.
Where'd you get so much pain?
I don't think they're friends.
I made a deal with Tom.
I thought Tom and Mary were friends.
I've had some good news from them.
Distilled water is delicious.
Dad's in the garden now.
Harry's working a day at the local supermarket.
It's very unlikely that I'm late.
I told them to be on their way.
Tom said he was completely tortured.
I used to dream of being a millionaire.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Tom's planning on staying with his girlfriend.
Where are you going tonight?
Tom locked the door in his bedroom.
I knew Tom a few months ago.
You're desperate!
Tom's playing very well on the script.
No one blames you.
Next year is Crolic.
Tom's almost always taking a bath before the wedding.
I can take you home.
What did you learn?
Please write down what I'm saying.
Now I'm adding the last string.
I can't forget Tom.
I don't have a book.
Tennis is the only kind of sport Tom has.
Come to the coast.
Let me help you.
I was much calmer, so I fell asleep right away.
Tom is my favorite singer.
Remember, I love you.
As they claim, he's a killer.
Mary didn't want to trust Halloween as an open suit, so she decided to dress like a housewife.
Tom made a walk.
Tom spent three hours.
Mary said she didn't want to drink.
You knew Tom better than I did.
Maybe people like us shouldn't have children.
I won't do that anymore.
Every morning I want to buy.
The kid's lying.
Tom refused to sign a document.
Tom didn't even touch his stomach.
I don't want Tom to get out of here without me.
I've been watching how you're doing.
He has the ability to make mathematics.
Watch out!
He's the father of a new treatment.
Men were then men.
Swiss banks are very secret.
As soon as you finish your mission, you can drink as much as you can.
I'm the only one who can help you.
I hate winter.
What do you think Tom will say when he finds out?
The birth is approaching.
You want us to do this together?
All our attempts were in vain.
He's got another glass.
Please pay attention, I'm starting to listen to the patient, and make sure that they have followed the correct procedure - you should contact her tomorrow.
Please, Saul.
She spent all her money.
Tom slept in the ambar.
You're looking at export.
Tom was tall for his age.
Did you notice what Mary's series is?
You're late again in school.
What's your favorite Kingsman?
So I didn't have to ask for it twice.
You have to go to Boston.
I was excited.
She's rich, young and beautiful.
Do you love your country?
I rarely see you with Tom.
I'm tall enough.
From a practical point of view, there are many shortcomings.
It's the house I live in.
I want to go to school with him.
Looks like you don't agree with it.
Tom didn't kill Mary.
I don't know what I mean.
I got to Harvard.
You're like a broken plastic.
I can't leave him alone.
Tom broke the window.
Jesus, by letting no one enter the herd of pigs, demonstrated the impartiality of God’s Law concerning unclean animals.
I'm Captain.
I think we'll be fine.
We had to come.
I'm wrong about that.
Today is my birthday.
We need to tell people what they need to do.
If she's poor, I'll buy her.
I told him what to do.
She didn't even feel it.
It was a good movie.
You're a coward?
I'll never let you forget that.
Tom forbade me to talk to you.
Who are you going to sell it to?
I don't want divorce.
I grew up in Australia.
Tom gave me a lot of anger.
The missing boy was known for his clothes.
I have good reflections.
Tell me what it was like.
She, at least, refuses to follow his advice because she does not like him.
Did you write it?
I know you're working on them.
I hope I can help you.
Do your parents know about this?
The officer put a white box on the table.
That day I stayed home because it was raining.
Is there an appetite around here?
I read it.
Tell me where I can find her.
Why is Tom looking at me like that?
I called the police and reported that my car had been violated.
We can discuss it later.
It's a little helpful.
The goats in ancient Egypt were sacred animals.
Can I speak openly?
I work for a oil company.
Why don't you find someone else who needs your help?
Tom applied to Mary's milk milk milk powder.
He hurt his left hand.
She's Italian?
We want to go.
The population of this city is reduced every year.
Dan didn't want to be persistent.
Can't you tell me something about yourself?
Did you find a difference between these two photos?
He never saw so many books gathered in one place.
You look a little tired.
Don't forget to call me.
It's a new tricky language.
I would never do that.
Correct him, please.
You need to add a milk pack to reduce the flow.
I could show you the city.
I know Tom's sick.
You didn't do anything wrong.
Take another penny.
I want to sleep!
You must be an idiot.
Tom's in the park.
I didn't think you'd be here today.
"Who are you national?"
Why are you pregnant?
I can do it better than you.
Don't forget!
I really think so.
The son of a bitch broke.
Tom brought his room in order.
Did you complain?
I don't love Tom very much.
So the plans will have to be changed.
Someone tasted him.
You want to know something else?
Tom said he wanted to see us before he left.
But I don't have any money.
How's Mary's new payment for you?
There was fear in his face.
If you don't tell her, I'll tell her.
Can you trust the secret?
My mother died in an accident.
London is the capital of England.
Her mother was certain.
You want us to call her?
I asked Tom to explain.
You're the one who blames yourself.
Tom told everyone that he was taken.
Tom promised he wouldn't say anything.
Something's changed.
It's not the only key.
Ask Alex.
It's just money.
Take her somewhere.
I was like when it happened.
Her origin is unknown.
Take it easy.
It wakes up from deep sleep.
You're big.
Where did you see him?
I don't know why you want me to do this.
I hope I see him on Monday.
Are you sure you want to sell your father's guitar?
There's no girl on the Internet.
They'll find you.
I'm trying to figure out why this happened.
We'll send them open.
If you don't want to answer, you don't have to.
Look left and right, before crossing the road.
Tom was my friend too.
I didn't know her then.
We've heard these promises before.
What did you and Tom do after the wedding?
I'm very tired.
As is often the case today, Mike was late for the meeting.
Tom told me Mary had a new boyfriend.
We won't let that happen.
These fools violated the law prohibiting the violation of the law.
It's not done yet.
John was so loud that I heard him on the second floor.
Tom checked his view.
I didn't give it to Tom.
They're doing strange things.
I know you're rich.
Bill put a hundred dollars on the trip.
He served in the fleet.
Who taught you how to dance?
Tom's got a nose.
I wouldn't be surprised.
Seriously, I don't believe it.
You knew them better than I did.
None of us want that to happen.
How much more wine to buy?
I'm not going to rock.
He lived in the car and left.
Tell Him everything that's happened here.
I'm looking for my phone.
He shared his soup with me.
All models are wrong, but some are useful.
I don't have time to do homework.
It's a big step forward.
Pray for me, Tom.
We still don't know the side effects of this medicine.
Tom's been in pain for three days.
You seem to know everyone here.
Hope dies last.
That's the girl who came here yesterday.
I'll give you a new one.
You kind of said it was yours.
Where did he buy these bottles?
Don't let me do this.
What did you get into?
Tom usually goes to work on the bus.
Fadel went to school.
I've been working with Tom before.
Tom and I are team partners.
Leave him alone!
My heart gets more and more beat every time I see her.
Do I think that's what I think?
Everyone except Tom, you're blind.
She gives him everything he asks us.
Will it be sold?
I'll get worse.
Do you have that better?
It's legal.
Do you like your name?
We can't afford to buy a new car.
It's just making the problem worse.
Tom told me he saw Mary tonight.
Tom heard the sound of a smile in the toilet.
I called at the door.
Tell him I'm sick.
They're already gone.
Can you take your car for a while?
You can't stay here all day.
I saw Jessie standing there.
They're very close.
You're soft.
There's a little sugar in the package.
That's what I did when I was a kid.
Something very good has happened today.
What are you talking about?
Don't worry about other things.
Who's the son of a football?
Toma's American accent.
I don't have any money to buy a dictionary.
Why are you so surprised?
It's dark to see.
I want you to tell me everything.
She looks good for her age.
If I knew her address, I'd write her a letter.
She took care of her marriage.
We need to talk to them.
I'd like to talk to you.
Tom's gone wrong.
It's the third time now.
Levi's strong.
I had to make sure he was coming here.
She said she didn't know the rules.
Education is one of the most important aspects of life.
The boy did fix the cap.
Maybe we're wasting?
He's capable of mathematics.
I'm glad you told me about her.
He's afraid of a cat.
I heard you're playing good in the band.
Did you read them?
I told him I wouldn't help him.
Tom's sorry he left Boston.
I don't like this store.
Tom speaks French more awfully.
I don't remember how much I paid for it.
You're not eating with us?
Tom lives in Australia with his wife and three children.
I barely got a seat on the trip.
I don't like to argue.
You like science fiction movies?
I make her happy.
Just tell him what I called.
I don't want to go upstairs.
His house behind the hall.
It was a resurrection, and I didn't get up early.
How many lunches!
Mary, are you in a pretty way now?
I made a mistake.
You want me to call them?
Tom made 20 repairs.
I'm sure you can handle the job.
After Mary gave it to him, she poured out a bottle of wine and took a hard step out of the restaurant, and a dead silence appeared.
You're two years younger than Tom.
We've met them.
Tom's wearing a dress tomorrow morning.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary together.
You don't mind, do you?
I think you'll need a credit.
Father Tom, who's in prison, never writes to Tom.
It's expensive.
I didn't get any information from him a hundred years ago.
I didn't know Tom couldn't swim.
I thought we all had a long time to meet.
They're all interested in Japan.
Tom's getting out of here very easily.
Please, just do everything I can.
Stay there.
I disagree with him.
It's called success.
The room was so dark that I had to try.
How many U.S. Army planes?
She's your teacher?
Have another drink, Tom.
What are you hiding from me?
Tom realizes he doesn't need it anymore.
Tom was in the garden.
Young plants are planted in the grass of the winter.
I speak French.
If that sounds too good to be true, it's probably not true.
Leave it where he found it.
Tom had to tell Mary.
Why do they all look at me?
Tom kissed Mary yesterday.
I'm not afraid of him.
I'm very proud of my father.
I told you it worked.
It all seems so strange.
Tom decided to go.
You taught me a lot.
How long are you going to sleep?
Get the mouse.
Tom apologized to the audience.
Tell Mary I have her key.
You bought something?
Canada's family hockey on ice.
The brain's a very complex organ.
They'd agree.
Your Japanese good.
The wind broke through the window.
Peaches are disgusting little things.
I want to know where it is.
Kiss without a mouth, like a soup without a salt.
Did you try to talk to him?
Where are the rest of the prisoners?
That's what happened today.
I saw the car hit man.
We accepted their invitation.
Tom worked with Mary.
I'm standing up to death.
You know what your kids are doing right now?
You want her to stay?
He's running after her.
Please tell me I'm right.
We've seen the lock before us.
Tom kept kissing her.
Six comes in front of the family.
I went to my grandmother's grave today.
Tom couldn't believe someone wanted to kill him.
Tom didn't dance with Mary.
I saw a man who ate from the frozen cow yesterday.
I think Tom did it to me.
She took me under her wing.
Tom and Maria stopped laughing when they noticed that John was crying.
I need to meet Tom.
Tom lost his thumb.
You signed a contract?
I told him he had to talk to a lawyer.
What, they didn't live in that bus again?
Let Tom come home.
I'm not hungry either.
He's got a lot of friends.
The area has changed completely.
Tom Antisimitis.
What is your most powerful side?
Tom doesn't like it when it's explained.
Interestingly, when Angela Agurbash sang a song in the words of Nekleeva, could she imagine that he would vote in the presidential elections?
There's yogurt in the refrigerator.
Can you tell us what's going on?
It's always said openly.
The photo must be there for two-thirds.
Show me Boston on the map.
Tom said he couldn't.
Tom wasn't in his room?
Why don't you find him?
They survived, even though the building was destroyed.
I wouldn't want anything better.
Tom wants a kiss.
My favorite restaurant burned.
John's unbelievably, he's making a lot of mistakes.
Tom took Mary's interview.
Tom is my personal assistant.
Who's this guy?
Keep the kids away from the fruit.
Let's talk about this tonight.
I have to do it.
They don't know French.
Come on!
I knew what Jackson was doing.
You don't have to apologize to me.
Tom and Mary have one grandson and three grandchildren.
He's gonna want some cash.
You're so excited.
Tom's getting a little drunk.
I barely understood him.
He avoided bribes.
You can live in a big house and not feel lonely at all.
I hope Tom tells me what to do.
I'll see him tonight.
One plus one is two.
That's better.
The universe is endless.
I'm not ready to do this yet.
Thank you for your visit.
What did you mean?
I wanted to spend more time with you.
Can you tell me about Tom?
Can Tom give me a few words?
Don't laugh like that.
When was Tom arrested?
We'll eat at 6:00.
He became a victim of leukemia.
Tom didn't want to go.
Tom's a little younger than your daughter.
I did everything I could to save Tom.
Try to talk to her to help us.
Are you with us?
Forget your wish.
Tom's alive.
It may last ten years, but it won't become a crocodile.
It made him feel like he didn't understand what Mary was trying to tell him.
I saw what happened.
I think there can be no other reason than that.
I'm very happy now.
My apartment was stolen last week.
How do you always get that energy?
Put your signature here.
What an ego!
So you bought it?
A man is as old as he is, and a woman is how she looks.
Wisdom comes with age.
Do you remember what you told me?
There was a lot of snow in the last year.
He tried to cross the river.
Everything seems to be enough.
Tom told Mary she was telling the truth.
You don't want another girl?
I like to play along the river.
You can come with me.
That word is a great gift for us.
"How long to the moon?" "Five minutes."
Tell her.
Mary spent all her time at work.
Tom lived on his motorcycle and took him away.
Have you ever been to Scandinavia?
Can I open my eyes?
I don't want to play cards.
I want to keep working here.
I live in Latvia.
I've been watching him for ten.
Tom usually says the first thing that comes to his head.
Why do you want to go?
How's French going to be "to see"?
It wasn't that expensive.
What's wrong with your computer?
We were both busy.
I'm fine.
We're not going to let you go.
You really think Tom's gonna be able to swim?
How are you going to spend so much money?
Mary likes to hang out with bad guys.
It is often said that every week in the world, one language disappears.
She has a small advantage.
I thought we were talking about it already.
How my parents would have been angry if I had suffered a failure.
I'll wash the cup every day in the morning and in the evening.
Hold your tongue, you won't get it.
You must take into account all the consequences before any changes to the existing code are made.
I don't have teeth.
I think you did a great job.
Last night we had a strong rain.
What did you get, Tom?
That's what I wanted.
Tom noticed that the door was open.
That's when he hurt her.
I'd rather say something about him.
What choice have I had?
You should stay up.
Back home earlier, Bill.
She sat on the table and read the magazine.
Since then, crying has been prohibited.
If I knew that, I'd tell you.
This is the house where he lived.
I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to a bitch.
You don't even think about it!
It looks more like a white house.
I found it difficult to find an original quote.
I had no idea you were with her.
What's the point of doing this?
Which dog is yours?
You have to give him more time.
You didn't tell me Tom was speaking French.
Tom is back in Boston next week.
Why don't you help me?
I watched a film in French with English subtitles.
I'm eating.
I mean, Tom played well.
He only blames others, and he never blames himself.
Are you able to play the band?
Tom came to Mary and found her.
"When are you going back?"
How many bones do they live?
How safe is that?
Your message has been received.
At the end of my building, I was three years old.
I was disappointed.
Don't talk to your mother like that.
We'll see if we can do that.
Tom didn't want us to attend his party.
I figured out what's going on.
She said it's late.
Your parents still live in Germany?
I need her today.
Tom, at least, wins.
What would you like Dad Moroz to bring you?
Why doesn't Tom want to see me?
Where's your spirit of adventurer?
Why are you mad at me?
You can leave if you want.
I see you've already met.
Something tells me you're right.
It's not my cat.
The captain ordered his men to shoot.
Sit down there.
He hasn't done it yet.
Tom became a father.
Tom prayed to my daughter.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
It's hard to be a woman, to think like a man, to act like a lion, to look like a girl and to work as a thief.
Let me start talking to her first.
I tried to convince her, but I couldn't.
I thought you were a Canadian.
Why are you sitting on my chair?
It sounds simple.
I can't afford to buy it.
I've never seen you in the back.
Put him on the pole.
I thought you found someone else.
There is always a large number of vehicles on this road.
You lied to us all.
I don't think Tom has a brother or a sister.
He must love you.
It's pointless to pretend that you're letting me believe that I believe in what you don't believe!
I think that would be a big mistake.
Tom and Mary have a son.
I'm sorry.
I appreciate your support.
You think it's possible?
After all, he was sick.
You think Tom's locked up?
If that's true, she's better for me.
I'll take good care of Tom.
Tom, it looks like he didn't recognize you.
I refuse to help Tom.
Can I sit with her?
Leave him alone.
Are you reading anything other than the Bible?
Read to me the book show in the box.
What's this gentleman working for?
Why do you think that's why you like it?
Do your parents know about this?
Is that what they're talking about?
Tom's waiting for you at the conference room.
The main thing in Tatoebe is not to say the thoughts above and below the knee.
He paid him four dollars.
I had to cancel my trip because of the shock.
I don't know your name.
How many trips to Boston?
What's the word for this song?
Mary likes to kiss a brother.
The law on my side.
So we had to find a place to live.
Tom was with Mary all morning.
The publication of the article was postponed until the day of the teacher's birth.
You had a phone call a few times while you were in your mind.
She went out for him because of the money.
No bird is capable of five.
I bought him a magazine.
I don't think Tom hates you.
Tom doesn't respect them.
It's just sovereignty.
It must take its own decisions.
Count, please.
Your shoes should always be clean.
You've got a birthday soon.
Read it.
I don't like those boots.
Tom's been married to Mary for a long time.
It's just a picture I jumped into the Internet.
I think it's less than thirty.
Did you drink?
Of course, he is the best fit for this work.
You're making it easy for me to work.
Tom said he saw Mary do it.
Tom can't just leave.
I love you.
It doesn't look like you're very busy.
Dedline's gone.
You look much like me.
You know about these men?
Tom left the room, didn't say a word to anyone.
That probably didn't happen.
Are you finished lunch?
Tom and Mary talked for no less than an hour.
I want you to stay with us.
He tried to save her.
If you click on this button, the door will open.
How much do you need?
I came back to help you.
Tell me more about them.
Did you hear the last words?
I'd show you how this is done.
I told Tom to come.
You've got a piece of cake.
Mom taught me not to waste money.
We could go on foot.
She died yesterday in the second half of the day.
I can't raise our daughter alone.
He took a place for me.
I wanted to talk about it.
I screamed for help.
Can you explain your answer?
I know it's important to you.
They all knew her.
We better stay.
I'm not late anymore.
I'm really hungry.
I live pretty close to you.
Tom's getting into trouble.
Why is Tom disagreeing with you?
I have to go back to Australia.
People usually die if they kill them.
They turned Tom off the life insurance machine.
I didn't know what I was talking about.
Excuse me for my French.
What did I do now?
Tom and Mary are very common.
Tom wants to go to the beach.
They don't want me.
They wouldn't tell me the truth.
We always talk about each other.
I'm never satisfied.
Tom's both younger and younger.
Tom's got a broken ear.
I'm marrying a lawyer.
Another interesting source of energy is heat, which can be obtained from radioactive waste.
He's smarter than me.
Why did you tell him first?
Your grandmother is a charming lady.
He shouldn't do that.
The 12-hour journey made me tired.
The boy was sleeping in the middle of the night.
I said I'd stop.
Who's the boss of this company?
No one saw how we did it.
He came back two days later.
Tom's late.
We should be home soon.
When did you move to Boston?
I know Tom and Mary are praying.
Eda!
Did you help him keep the window?
It's out of my powers.
It was yesterday.
I'm beginning to love myself.
Who wants to be your son when he grows up?
I'm left here.
Don't tell him what really happened.
I'm not going to give you that.
Then what do you say?
Did you talk about your hobby?
Get down here.
Why can't I see her?
I showed my friends these openings.
Tom didn't realize he made a mistake.
I broke the sword.

He read this book yesterday.
Where did Tom find this photo?
Tom gave me money and advice.
What do you want to hear from me?
Please, open the door.

She's been married to him for 20 years.
I can't give anyone that word.
Give me that bag.

Your children know French?
Tom called and ran away from the room.
This soup gives the fish.
There's a lot of girls in the room.
He's talking too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in the coffee.
You didn't know I was teaching in Boston French?
Tom was very surprised.
They're trying to win time.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among people who spoke in a terrible way, from the Jewish perspective, the Galilean dialect of Aramaic rather than the ubiquity, thus showed the inconsistencies of claims of the existence of a sacred language, which is particularly close to God in prayer.
And then Tom thought about it.
My opinion is different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
That's why they paid for it three dollars.
You don't know all the facts.
I know Tom's doing it.
The weather forecast is not wrong.
Tom, obviously, doesn't know anyone.
I'll ask Tom to prepare you something to eat.
I'll go find Tom.
I don't have any more books.
I want you to read this book.
Tom didn't wear a gun.
That's my answer!
I heard how he drank in his soul.
You remind me of my youth.
Tonight, Tom's on vacation.
I'm always busy.
I'm a little fortified.
I thought you were a vision.
Tom got up fast.
Please tell everyone I'm sorry.

Is that my book?
The strike is a routine job.
Who else's on your list?
Don't give Tom my phone.
I already decided who I'm going to go with.
I'd like to know what to tell them.
Tom's kids must have fallen on him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you should talk to them.
He's reading physics in Oxford.
He hid this fact from me.
Is that what you saved me?
He was very brave in his sleep.

Someone said something, but I didn't understand.
Someone needs to talk to him.
I've never been worried about them.
Tom was able to get to the hospital on his own.
I live with Tom.
You've got a lot of confusion.
Have you always been such an egoist?
I think this medicine will be of great benefit to you.
Tell him to be here for half a third.
It's not God's science news.
Tom suspected Mary was using drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't tell her.
I'm afraid it'll rain.
Do you want a beer?
Where did you see him?

The bus was over.
Where do you want to go next exit?
How great is that?
I'm tired.
Tom wasn't engaged to Mary.
Get out of my office.
This car is good for sale.
I need to work on these exits.
You can't do that to us.
His words hurt me.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know what he had to do.
Say hello to her from me.
Was that a lie?
Tom's response to all the shocks.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom in answer?
I'm ready to go.
Where was your son?
I saw it in the store.
Peace of cruelty.

I want you to ask me a word.
No one likes me.
I'm sorry I don't know Tom's phone.

"Where do you have my phone?"
When are you going to pick up the sand?

"Now leave X-Wing, Your Majesty." "I'm not going out. I'm going to space." "As it is written, you're a treasure!"
I felt the smell of food for a long time before I came home.
My father wore a box of mail in the red.
A lot of people ignore smiles.
Besides Tom, everyone in the family speaks French.
I'm not so young to know everything.
Don't pay attention to them.
I know you don't like me.
The police found Tom dead on the wing.
I'm not as happy as you are.
I did everything you asked me to do.
Are you planning on buying a house?
On the table.
Tom says he doesn't want to go with me to Australia.
He came, he saw, he won.
Life is not always fair.
I saw Tom reading your keys.
The whole night was thrown out because of Tom and Mary's hair.
Can you read it?
We need more farmers.
Tell us more about your trip.
Six degrees below zero.
I don't expect you to believe that.
We saw many unusual plants in the botanical garden.
Sometimes a small gift may be a great expression of love.
You prefer a blonde or a blonde?
I'm not in the bus.
That's why he didn't like this movie.
You want us to help you?
Be realistic.
Tom was planning on setting up a party.
I'll call someone for help.
Why didn't you tell us about this before?
Is it Chinese or Japanese?
Fire.
I'm making a success.
You're pale as a vision.
I'll be home to six.
It's not that difficult for France.
Let's get out of the cab.
He was sitting.
Tom never missed school.
I suggest you do this today.
I'm not going to marry her.
Tom has five apple juices.
Are you going on a trip?
We think so too.
How could something like that happen?
You're an actress.
It was heartbreaking.
I forgot to ask.
I've always had my hands and feet cut.
How can I translate words that are not in any language except mine?
Could you tie this tape?
I'll go home.
She always keeps her room clean.
I hate people like Tom.
I asked Tom to wait for us.
We've been shot.
Tom's really bad for me.
I used to have my head all the time once a week.
Eleven is a simple number.
I won't give you back.
Coffee for my account.
We're men and women.
Jackson invited us to dinner tonight.
Tom was rude.
In October, mail began to fall.
Melanie said she likes to swim.
What's wrong with you?
Now I'm too busy to talk to you.
The captain controls his ship and command.
Tom says he wants to be buried here.
Where did you split the door?
Three prisoners fled.
Thank God!
You think Tom knows?
I'm crying this time.
Tom took himself as a child.
Stop singing.
There were six people at the party.
What have you decided?
I didn't know you were romantic.
I saw you spying on Tom.
I need you to do it right away.
The thief came into the house through that door.
I know how to survive.
Mary worked most of her life.
Parna Mary's name is Tom.
I'm afraid I have to admit something.
Tom was expected to be there yesterday.
He was an important man.
I want you to stay with me.
He's in the hospital.
Don't forget to register.
There you will be safe.
I'm in Tehran.
"Are you speaking Greek?" - "No, it's my first lesson!"
Why did you give him money?
Tom bought something for Mary?
You went to Boston last week?
I didn't play tennis last night.
Let me do this more.
We must respect their wishes.
How did you deal with her?
I've already been to Sapporo.
I told you to get out of here.
We'll try to get rid of all our forces.
Would you buy that?
Tom's late on the plane.
She'll always get up early.
Do you want her to help you?
You eat rice every day?
We're sitting in the very depths of the audience.
You'll survive.
What did she buy in that store?
When will we have the president's wife?
He's here hoping to see you.
I'm glad Tom did it.
I'd buy it.
Have you ever seen this movie?
I know what you did last night.
The bus stop is near our school.
That's the money I'm drinking for you.
England looks like Japan in many ways.
Tom would never do that.
I suggest you try harder.
The dog doesn't even scare the kid.
Don't resist.
Tom's got the keys.
When I have a bad mood, I like to think about the mountains to get bored.
How would you feel if someone came up with you like that?
We both really want to sleep.
Tom just can't do anything he wants.
Tom often tells us anecdotes.
Luke can be used in many scrolls.
There's almost no snow here.
I asked Tom to help us.
She hit the tree with a bullet.
You speak English?
My brother will kill me.
I opened the key.
Tom can stay with me.
Is it hard to learn Greek?
Will Tom come with you?
Where's the remote control pulse?
I can't find her either.
You speak Swedish.
Have you seen anyone else?
Tell me why you're here.
Don't put the tube on.
Tell him not to fall on his eyes.
We looked in the window, but we saw nothing.
Do you want to work with them?
It was an interesting movie.
I'm out of power, I'm working with tomorrow till dinner.
How much are we going?
It's a deal.
Tom's very emotional.
Why are you avoiding me?
What about Tom?
I hope you're not crazy.
He's headed for the bird.
Tom's leaving on Monday.
Come on!
I have to go further.
She was crying with her nose to the glass.
There is no distinction between ser and estar languages in English.
I know exactly what to do.
He's very secret.
You've got a superior English.
Do I have any messages?
Tom didn't want to cry.
How much time do you have?
Writing text, driving a car, is very dangerous.
Tom said Mary agreed.
Tom said Mary won't win.
Why did you pick up the fight?
I want to go back to this house.
How much do you have?
The moon was broken.
Why don't you go and kill yourself?
Tom spoke first.
Did you ask Fomo to stay?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want Tom to think he's supposed to break me up.
I was very calm.
It's all about hiding.
We'll have a few guests tonight.
Her voice will still ring in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you some questions.
Time's running out.
Why do you always take his side?
We weren't cold.
I saw it on the cross.
All men are the same.
You're hot?
His son - in - law.
Don't let the case go.
Why don't we have dinner tonight at the restaurant?
Some birds didn't fly.
What else do you want from me?
What did Tom ask you about?
I told him you came to Australia.
You wanted that?
You didn't tell me you had a brother?
Where are you waiting for me?
I was really worried about you.
What did you find?
Can you explain that to me?
We were hit by a snowstorm.
The book - on the table.
I don't want any of them.
What's wrong with us?
You'd better start asking him.
They fired him against the will.
Take them to the hospital.
Tom told you where he bought his tube?
She didn't answer him in writing.
I hired someone at work today.
Stop wasting your money!
Tom wants us to stay.
I'm in the kitchen.
It's the biggest machine in the world.
Tom never asks why.
I have to get back to work.
Tom told me Mary didn't do that.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had with him.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
I've done it already.
What time is it?
I sent her a message.
You owe me three hundred dollars.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
Don't you introduce me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know that I will always love you.
She said she was ready to do it.
She was crying.
I told him that Mary had to do this.
You're both idiots.
Do you like living in the city?
How much did you have for that time?
We've finally got everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm Tom's manager.
Who are you planning to go to Australia with?
Someone called.
What's better?
We thank you for your help.
Go to your room!
That's not what I told him to go.
What do your parents want for Christmas?
The trip is going to thirty-three.
I know you're hiding something.
Free animals from the cell.
He's afraid of a cat.
You look like a father.
George was five years older than me.
Give me the cigarette.
Do as they told you.
Please take a look at this movie.
Someone's calling.
I ran away.
Why are you not ready?
I can't love your new car.
You shouldn't have done that.
You're much higher than Tom.
You can use his library.
I congratulated him on his son's birth.
Mary says she needs more time.
Fom's out of the door.
My dad is an English teacher.
At the birth of Tom and Mary, they gave their grandson a bicycle.
Hold on to your hair.
Did you do that?
I'd like you to move it to French.
How many on the table?
The lawyer has convincing evidence that she is innocent.
Maybe.
I don't love Tom anymore.
Who's Tom with?
Taro has a strong sense of responsibility.
We both saw him.
We're in charge of help.
Tom recently left prison.
Did you tell him?
I am!
Tell me what you saw.
I think I found what you were looking for.
Let your grandfather think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I've developed a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you would do the same for me.
I can't believe Tom did it all.
I don't want to listen to your theories.
Tom already told me what I wanted to know.
Only in philosophy can the circle be used for evidence and a high assessment.
I can't let myself have children.
When I visited them in France, they only drank on me, and I couldn't stop them from understanding my own language.
Let me go?
I was so stupid that I believed in it.
She really did.
I mean, it's very expensive.
I'll find her.
It's been ten hours.
White bread, please.
I love you.
Tom's not grammatical.
I think Tom's still out of work.
We'll deal perfectly with each other.
French complex, isn't it?
He doesn't like fish.
The danger has passed.
We need more wood.
Tom said Mary was upset.
Let me know if you need any help.
We have to get there before he gets there.
He must have fallen on it.
He says he's not sick.
Paris far away?
How long has it been in Tokyo?
He said he was hoping to see you.
Tom and I did what we were told to do.
Frieda Kalo was a Mexican artist.
No one knew why.
Jim's not coming today.
You're gonna be a father, you're gonna get it.
Last Monday I saw you and Tom.
Where did you take your shoes?
We went to the beach.
What do you think this year's Christmas snow will be?
How was Tom's dinner?
I need a toilet.
I stayed in one of my friends' halls.
I'll work for you wherever you pay me the same good.
I'd like to have a coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth lately.
You're the only one who likes Tom here.
I know what Tom would do.
You won't have a second chance like that.
Immediately, he agreed to pay for the ransom.
All accounts have to be paid to me.
She's stuck.
Tom said he was looking for you.
We're not as rich as Tom.
Tom owes Mary hair.
Tom didn't show me happy.
When I grow up, I want to be a fireman.
Tom's always dry with his mother.
We forgot to record!
Tom said he likes it here.
No, I didn't.
She's one of those I know.
Mary's already in the room?
This time I forgive him.
I like Chinese drinks very much.
It's just what you think.
Tom wasn't a good coach.
He's a coach.
Alvaro from Venezuela.
Here's the account.
He must have hurt me.
Tom won't win any more.
Why don't I stay with you?
Magnets are used in the induction plates for direct heating.
I was scared.
Tom wants to learn how to play on a drum.
Get out immediately.
Can I look at your rights?
I'll take 1,000 songs with you in exchange for these jeans.
How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.
He forgot the sweater.
Tom also lives in Australia.
I didn't know exactly what to start with.
Here's the memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I have two tickets to a concert.
I had to go to Australia with you.
Tom's drunk.
He wrote a few letters to his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you crying?
How much is that worth?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to walk behind the garden.
It's about a hundred and eighty grams of cheese.
I had to leave that note.
You're a Canadian?
You're tougher than Tom.
I'm waiting for Tom from half a third.
He likes that.
Tom knew Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary do this together.
Someone else noticed that?
This proposal is not in English.
I'll tell you what, Tom's fine.
She played the sonat.
You can write in any language you want. Tatoeba has the same language.
The infection was in the blood.
Tom didn't want to buy Mary a present.
Does he know me?
I hate this place.
Sometimes you say thank you.
There are times when he's watching TV.
Am I ready?
I've been looking for you.
I still think it's bad.
Run, you bastard!
I saw a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
You got me!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the present situation.
I know what you told her.
I only slept after two hours of night.
Mary did not give in to despair.
So it wasn't as hard to sleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I tried to wake Tom up.
They say that film is very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late for heavy rain.
I judge everything, she's healthy.
It was in a silhouette.
Look at your brother.
Tom said there's no way to wait for permission.
It's too late.
You're already dead?
I love a hot dog.
How often do you get up on Saturday?
I added milk to the coffee.
How can I change it?
Spain adopted the 1992 Olympic Games.
I never betrayed you.
We used to do this together.
My house is just a little out of here.
I don't care about money.
There are no winners.
Tom wins.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know Tom's capable of drawing.
They're packed.
I didn't know what it would be impossible to do.
Are you happy?
Man was sentenced to death.
Was it snow yesterday?
You scared her.
You don't get Tom.
Did you kill her?
Tom knows French?
He studied Russian when he was young.
Put it back.
Tom and Mary are almost one year old.
I was impressed.
I don't advise you.
We didn't discuss it.
Tom caught Mary’s eye.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wants to go to the zoo.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary for self-defense.
What is the difference between faith and trust?
Tom put the paper on the table.
What did you know?
If the weather allows, tomorrow we'll get to the top of the mountain.
We both know him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve the problem.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom read the old gloves.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of the god Ra.
Tom saw it?
The more I thought about the problem, the harder she said.
His eyes were wide open, his eyes wide open, and his normally pale face was refreshed and covered with Romanians.
What kind of bitch do you love most?
Tom stood before Mary.
Take another one.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands were cut off from the cold.
Do you want to be famous?
Do it carefully.
It's hard for me to solve this problem.
Typhon destroyed a lot of homes.
This man was sentenced to death.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Is there anyone here who can speak French?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me take your bag.
Besides, I can't dance.
I love you so much, I'm not going to wait when I see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
Power in Tom's hands.
I learned to work and play as my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me?
No one's going to blame you.
I'm not doing anything right now.
Children like to play more than they can learn.
He was taken for his younger brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my father.
Guess what language I'm talking about.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My boyfriend is a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don't like people who keep talking about politics.
Is it green or white?
We're not afraid.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
I'm going!
Do it until it's dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom's not used to that kind of work.
Bring your wife.
All of what, suddenly they're in fashion?
Tom said he wouldn't want to spend that much time.
You're upset.
Our grandson was born last night.
On Tom's pirate suit.
That's pure truth!
They went for a walk.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom must be here for 15 minutes.
I hope Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll pick you up.
We're proud of our achievement.
So Mary had to be invited.
Tom had to be punished.
Do you love it?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not a girl.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I go every day.
She's become a mailman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop being a cat!
What did you have to say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime have you committed?
How do we know this man is the one he's going to betray himself?
King Harald Gormsson, better known as Harald Sinezubbi, has entered Christianity in Denmark.
We can't do anything for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
That's where Tom could stay longer.
Almost everything was dead.
You have to get up early.
There's nothing wrong with it.
The last days have been very hot.
He's got a black coat.
I forgot to reap flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.
You can't be in this room.
Did you have any other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very gifted and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom took Mary?
Tom likes to read German Gesse.
In fact, I never spoke Portuguese.
When criminal proceedings are brought before the court, it is generally accepted that there are twelve persons in the court.
What was Tom doing in Australia's embassy?
Tom and I started meeting.
Boys marched around four in a row.
Tom was very disappointed.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very acidic.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized something was wrong.
We had no idea that Tom was going to do this.
It's been one more day.
You have to do this right now.
I have to go to the X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He got sick when he fell.
We're unsatisfied.
I've got comics all over me.
Tom, come on, we're late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you following your weight?
Tom's playing on a drum.
Are you from Tokyo?
I want her not to be in my house.
You probably can't do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonald's world famous for his hamburgers.
Tom made Mary a precious gift.
Do you have any idea?
Do you like these ghosts?
The castle's broken.
Almaz is a precious stone.
Enjoy your money, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Stop it, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come with us to Boston.
To my surprise, he was married to a very beautiful actress.
How'd you sleep?
I've got a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Maria.
They want better.
It works as an officer.
It'll be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many suffer from low self - esteem?
Was it too simple?
What Ellis was facing, waiting for, was a sudden war, and it was so loud that it was so hard to break her drums, and so hard to reach heaven.
I lost him in the dust.
We were talking about Jim when he came into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to leave his job.
That's why I can't go there.
Tom helped Mary get things in the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I've done is wrong.
A lot of books are published every year.
Tom gave Mary the money she asked him for.
Why do you hate her?
My sterile car broke down.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to borrow it.
I tried hard to solve the problem.
You should've done your homework.
I was on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right for you.
That stone was so heavy that I couldn't lift it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
As it turns out, it turns out.
We took a little cannon.
Have you ever tried a banana pirogue?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
What if Tom doesn't look remarkable?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look at the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his zone.
How can we explain this to our children?
I didn't even know your names.
Obeiana went to the tree.
The language I hear is very complicated.
Your kid can go.
Is that all Tom's doing?
I'd better not marry her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm getting married.
Are you really living alone?
I told you I'd be back.
Tom's the youngest of me.
Welcome to the real world!
We would like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The President shall rule for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have?
Can't you settle this?
And Tom, and Mary here.
What would you do with that?
In the building of twenty floors.
If you don't go, I won't go either.
You're probably not in the race when Tom's coming back?
I don't have Tom's photo.
Can you wait a minute?
Will you give him something for Christmas?
She won't kill him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm a Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom tried to help Mary.
She likes this singer.
If he had followed my advice then he would now be a rich man.
I made this decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There's a strong wind up.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to touch the parachute.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you are.
We're not as young as Tom.
How many do you plan to be at home tonight?
The dryer's gone.
Are you feeling okay?
He's like an eagle.
I think you can do it.
She knew she was wrong.
That's so cool!
Tom had the feeling that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to dinner.
When I came home, he was watching TV.
Tom talked to me last night.
Tom's ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't repeat it!
I called him, but I got a little girl.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We must maintain the plan.
I'll tell him what you called.
Tom is very strict with the kids.
How are the negotiations going?
He's ready for shame.
The beginning of history was interesting.
I thought Tom was interested.
I'm laughing at the monkey with the cat.
They're always complaining.
Tom's got little shots.
Did you understand what she said?
You're something broken.
It's not bad for her.
I'd better stay.
That's why I've come to my head with a brilliant idea.
She's breathing now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this a place of hope?
I didn't know why Tom's late.
He lost his job last month.
Who did you talk to?
I want to believe it's all right.
She always keeps her room clean and neat.
I guess that's why I have to go to Boston next week.
Don't go abroad.
Tom was scared to see it.
Tom's face has grown.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stay?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How's your new class?
You're afraid of your own dark.
Tom was very pleased.
He had an abstract understanding of hunger; he always had enough food.
There's a new roof in the room.
Can you stay with them?
Tom came early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left.
I'm the one who saved me.
Unfortunately, yesterday was rain.
Looks like he's sleeping.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of the cross?
How much do you want to go in?
She's got legs.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to discuss something important for both of us.
We need to take you to the hospital.
What's the same square root of two?
Tom fell in front and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're in trouble.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do that often.
I hope we don't do that anymore.
How many times have you helped Tom do this?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost trust you.
These precious treasures are precious.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get here, it's time to open.
I'm not sure what her size is.
He was also good for the animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom included a phonary and went into a cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Fom's off the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't think about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was upset.
Who doesn't wake up?
We cried with him.
You don't want to try again?
Wait a second.
What's the matter with you?
Milk can make oil, cheese, and much more.
You have no authority to do so.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you her relative?
When you drink water, don't forget those who hit the refrigerator.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for the younger daughter.
Take care of yourself.
Do you like jazz?
You're drunk.
I used to smoke.
You didn't know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an unnamed guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won as they expected.
He moved in the answer.
Tom said Mary's enough.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right track.
You'll get everything if you try.
You didn't mean to ask Tom for help?
You should try.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Couldn't you say that in human language?
No one's hungry except me.
Tom's very excited.
No snowflake in a snowy lion is considered to be innocent.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom to be here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know I'm sorry for you.
Can you speak French more than he is?
I'll solve this problem.
I told you Tom doesn't want to go.
When does the shop open?
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
He broke his leg wide open.
It's time to swim.
I really enjoyed this book.
You're important.
When the ice cools, it turns into water.
Jane asked Mary if she wouldn't stay overnight with her.
Tom didn't tell the police his name.
I went to school there.
The fish is still raw.
Try to remain positive.
I'm sick of it.
She smelled his ass.
Look at him.
Will it hurt?
The girl had a big red leg.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom lied.
I called you here to ask you a question.
Who's playing with Tom?
I need a light coat.
I've finished my job.
It's a cat.
Please tell me it's not true.
You're not coming?
I remounted his radio.
It's a very bad idea.
Tom's above you.
Tom found a job without a job.
This book in public access?
Please, can't you speak Greek?
I'll tell him he's in touch with Mary.
I helped them.
He's like a girl.
Please come to me, not like Jacob Matthewwich.
She's not one anymore.
Tom will never admit that he's wrong because he thinks it's a sign of weakness.
I was already in America.
It took more time than I thought.
Mary stayed with her father.
I thought I could trust her.
Do you have a new Steve Wander's album?
I was kicked out of my house because I didn't pay the rent.
Tell me where you went.
He stopped opposing and obeyed the court.
It happened at Park Street.
Eduardo's younger than Roberto.
The moon is a satellite of Earth.
I don't know.
There's nothing useless in nature.
No, she never fell in love.
You did it on purpose!
You won't need it.
Tom rarely goes to dinner.
You're not my mother.
Tell them we're going to eat.
Do I look like a guy who wants to marry?
I locked the door, but I didn't close it.
Therefore, it would be wise to stay awake and not give Mary a proper burial.
Can we help them?
Thank you for calling.
They're happy.
Please don't be so hard on me.
Now I'll command!
People, we've been doing good all year.
I'm not sorry.
I know Tom won't make it.
I don't like her very much.
He's not.
You're very smart.
Tom and I are planning to get married on October 20.
She thought I'd take her.
Now I live in Boston.
Tom left his secret with him in the grave.
You really want to put your money in that bank?
I don't think anyone else wants to do this.
We're teachers.
I'm probably very fond of you.
Why are you worried about her?
I'll never do that again.
Do the visitors exist?
Emily wants to be an electrician.
These books are better.
Don't try to remember every proposal in the text, it's almost impossible.
He's been studying French for eight years.
I thought it was you.
I personally think you're right.
I can't believe I did it anyway.
The candle's burning.
Why don't you get something to drink?
We're collecting clothing for homeless people.
Tom paid Mary a very good salary.
What do you think?
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Tom doesn't know why I didn't win.
Never in life!
Did Tom ever ask you to help him?
The chair has to start.
I thought you were right.
Why do they all look at us?
Where's Tom's key?
Did I really make your name?
No one saw her leave the room.
W-bank.
Tom will never find him.
All women are equal.
He allowed them to play in the garden.
I don't have a cross scar.
Your love is lying.
She's about my age.
Did you really do this free?
You want me to open the box?
Boys will always be boys, girls are girls.
You're ready to lie down.
There's nothing new about his addiction to alcohol.
He doesn't realize the risks.
That's why we don't have to do this anymore.
Do you have any idea who could do this?
The teacher warned us that the exam would probably be complicated.
I'm a married man.
He bought his son's camera.
Shut up and eat.
I gave you everything.
I dedicate this song to you.
I like her more.
You're too young to know that a logistic clinic.
I used to do it almost every day.
I'm deeply shocked.
About a billion people suffer from hunger and poverty.
I would like to inform you that your work has been accepted for publication in “SM”.
I believe in my right.
I didn't know you wanted to learn French.
Let's go home.
You have time.
I'm not coming.
Tom doesn't spend much time thinking about money.
So we have to go with Mary.
It's interesting what Tom is doing here.
You can't.
I don't think I can go faster.
Tom's got questions left.
Are you looking for someone?
Tom's hand's wearing a mask.
That's why he didn't have to go straight.
He'll be out of his parents' house soon.
I don't think he'll listen to us.
I want to go to England.
Did you see anyone in the park?
Didn't I warn you not to go there?
Tom moved here three years ago from Australia.
She left Boston.
We must consider all the options.
Tom could have killed me.
Uncle Ali was a drummer.
Why didn't anyone tell us?
He's going to the beach.
I went to look for Tom in the fire.
How old were you when you moved to Boston?
He'll be better aware of his problems.
Tom claimed he saw the NLO.
I know who you were with.
Tom's got a bike?
What did you ask them?
And the repair didn't go bad.
I'll be up every morning.
It's not bad, it's fake.
You got a car problem?
In the tourist information center, the city map was distributed to all who wanted it.
I'm sorry, but I can't.
Tom closed all the windows.
Come as soon as you can.
We're not very hungry yet.
Learning Chinese is not to impress his future boss, but to understand what he is saying.
You can add suggestions that you can't pass on to yourself, maybe someone else can do it!
Mary always home?
Just don't pay attention to Tom.
I don't think I'm taking it.
I'm sorry, I didn't notice that.
I'm teaching.
I knew Tom was bluffing.
I tried my best.
It's a good sign.
Some are convinced that their guardian angel is protecting them.
Tom left his bank account.
She's in the hospital now.
What's going to happen to me?
He was so interested that he paid his attention.
I told him I didn't care.
Tom wants to change society.
I thought you'd see nothing.
We're both here for the same reason.
Love is stronger than money.
I saw his head.
In our library there are many children's books.
I didn't leave her home earlier.
Did you talk to her?
How long will it take to get there?
I didn't want to interfere with you.
We all wanted each other's success.
Tom was born three days before his birth in 2013.
A young girl kept quiet.
When Tom heard his favorite song on the radio, he could not stop singing.
When will it end?
Tom kissed Mary and apologized.
The five-and-a-half-year-old left after the party.
Tom's meeting someone?
Tom didn't show me anything.
I hate driving a car.
They're different.
When you came back, I'm already gone.
Did you talk to him today?
I thought you stopped meeting him.
Tom called Mary.
She's swimming flowers.
A woman often calls me when she walks across the border.
You're in bed.
First of all, I would like to mark my position carefully.
Tom's capable of playing in the band.
Tom didn't decide what to do.
He doesn't like coffee.
Please, include the radio.
Don't bring Tom to the lake.
The police can't arrest Tom.
How did you fall into my room?
What do you want to give him?
We want to go to Australia.
I have a very small salary.
Tom's got a bear.
Tom knows where Mary's going.
You shot them.
Tell her, let her go.
I don't know anything about that.
We've been meeting for three months.
I'm glad you were there.
They set me up a big party.
This mountain is covered with snow for a year.
Tom stopped at Mary's store to buy sugar.
I like to be red.
Stay away from here.
What's the most disgusting movie you've ever seen in your life?
I thought you hated us.
Think well before you answer.
Tom says Mary needs more time.
I took it for a joke and didn't answer.
Actually, his name wasn't Tom Jackson.
Is that a joke?
Do not do what you will regret.
Do you see her?
I hope I can stay here for a long time.
Payment will be made according to experience and education.
I think Tom's right.
You don't have to do sports.
Tom told me you were a woman.
I decided I wouldn't stay.
I'm waiting for you and your family.
Did you change her?
I told you I was thinking.
Why did you say that?
You have to work hard if you want to succeed.
There are no exceptions in the empire.
If you need help, tell me.
Can I go home earlier today?
You wouldn't survive.
Tom didn't think Mary would bother it.
There's a trade area nearby.
Mary thinks she's the smartest.
Use your ass.
Tom doesn't know exactly where Mary lives.
I will remember you.
That's interesting news.
Tom is a hot drink.
We don't even know her.
Tom made several suggestions and checked them on Mary before he hit Tatoebu.
I know where you put your money.
The school's over.
It's a long karanda.
Does your mother know about that?
Do you really like that kind of food?
Tom looked in the mirror.
I told them not to tell anyone.
That's how Tom died.
The coffeeman's gone.
Please write in the canandas.
We can't go.
He became aware of his crime.
It's the most beautiful picture I've ever seen.
What are you doing here?
He's worried about something.
In time, Claudia was thinking about psychoanalysis.
Tom would never agree with that.
You need to find a job.
He'll be back later today.
She's very proud of herself.
I've gone about half a third.
Don't leave the tape on the sun.
I already knew that.
I saw them leave.
I'm surprised you remember them.
Hey, I know you.
Help, help!
Can I open the envelope?
You had no right to that.
I'm yours.
He picked as much as he drank.
Let the earth be your breath, Father!
Why are you still one?
I want us to be friends with your sister.
Who were you waiting here yesterday?
Do you like song?
It's expensive.
Tom's getting ready for breakfast.
Come on in.
I'll keep them for my grandchildren.
I heard Carol and Will broke up.
How's Tom doing?
Tom says he never did that.
Tom, it looks like a nice man.
Help me find her.
Tom didn't give it to me.
I had to go to church.
Firemen couldn't stop the flames.
Help's over.
It's crazy.
That's what happened here on Monday.
America's done slavery.
You don't know him?
Fortunately, he didn't die in an accident.
He often spends hours reading books.
I had no idea you could do that.
Tom broke the car.
Tom knew about Mary something he didn't know John.
The answer is no.
We need to call him.
Are you busy?
I've got a bad headache.
Tom, they're calling you.
You promised you wouldn't drink today.
Is everything ready tomorrow?
We checked it out.
Let's see what Tom is doing in the garage.
I don't think that's how it works.
I didn't do that.
Tom told me he'd come back.
How long are you coming tomorrow?
A bottle of openers.
Did you talk to Tom about this?
Is it flying?
She'll take you to the airport.
Tell me what else I need to know.
You can't let me marry you.
That's weird enough.
The paper's yellow.
I'm sorry, but she's not.
We have plenty to eat today.
He made a statement that supported my point of view.
Mount Kilimanjaro is a swimming volcano located in Tanzania.
Why don't you go with her?
Why didn't you just tell them?
I can't remove it.
Tom asked me why I never tried to get the driving rights.
I need to get back to Boston.
Have a seat, please.
Wake up, Tom.
Here's the map.
You had to stay with us.
Let's imagine we're internship.
Tom said he wasn't hungry.
I don't want to tell you anything.
I'd rather not tell you about it.
I didn't want to go anyway.
I'm not going to complain.
They kept their love secret.
She's stuck on the corner only to be late for the trip.
Don't say that to my nephew.
Tom has always had to pay the bill when they and Mary go to the meeting.
I urge you to reconsider your decision.
I don't care about your past.
The police were looking for Tom's car.
Although I felt something weird, I didn't know it was.
Are you a pig?
I went to the army.
Why can't you take me the way I am?
The bear is black.
Tom doesn't even know what Mary did.
I don't know who's going to be in the congregation.
It's hard to get to the president.
If it's hungry, eat.
I was scared.
He's no longer a member of our club.
I'll take care of it right away.
I don't trust her.
Six is equal to eighty-three.
‘Scala’ means the anagram ‘Laski’.
I've never seen Tom help anyone.
Dan took part in a campaign against racism.
You did it fast.
I need two minutes ahead.
He's on her side.
I didn't forget your betrayal.
I think you did a great job.
She was so thankful that she was amazed at all of us.
This is where she worked as a secretary.
They're not that bad.
I thought I had everything.
Don't worry, it'll be okay.
It's hard for me to work with Tom.
I'm competitive.
He says his son is now able to count before the table.
There's something wrong here.
Tom hates these things.
There's a small garden in front of my house.
Why didn't they leave?
I heard you paid someone to do it.
It's for my friend.
Tom said Mary was innocent.
Tulipan is an official color symbol of our prefecture.
I knew we'd become friends.
I didn't want to lose him.
She's in the hospital right now.
I'm going to give you some lessons in karate.
Don't worry about my dog.
Tom's getting cremated tomorrow.
That's not true.
You're no longer allowed to do this.
In the summers, tourists in Karuidzawa were chased by tourists.
I saw Tom sitting on the trip.
He didn't do anything wrong.
She's got eyes on it.
I love this advertising.
It was just water.
I bought it for my sister.
I'll never forget how we went to Hawaii with her.
No one's heard the call.
How did it get here?
Tom and Mary said they don't want to play.
I'd be happy to go with you, but I can't.
As a result of the events that took place on 11 September, the world's policies condemned terrorists for their worthy punishment.
Please, call me Taro.
I know both of them.
Don't you want to meet him?
Now Tom's scared.
You said it was urgent.
Tom's very happy.
I didn't want it to be the same with me.
I don't know all the students.
Thank you very much!
They killed civilians.
Tom told me to treat people with respect.
He did what you asked him to do.
Excuse me, where's the egg?
Peace on you.
I don't have a white one.
Tom is a violent businessman.
I can't go on Saturday.
We're getting married in October.
Tom and Mary don't agree with you.
We'll tell you soon.
Let's get out of here.
He'll never find the keys.
Her manner of speaking makes me nervous.
Eat what you like.
And then what happened?
Do you think he likes me?
Tom agreed to help Mary do this.
He prefers not to talk about it.
I told them to sleep before noon.
I just wanted to go back to my old life.
I'm sorry she called you.
I already told you everything you were supposed to know.
Health gives a person the freedom most of them do not realize until they leave.
Does it matter?
I know the secret of Tom.
Tom is a man.
It's not nice.
No one could believe that.
Tell her I'm rebuilding the refrigerator.
That's amazing.
There's blood flowing out of the ear.
Post-modernism differs from modernism.
I've already read this book.
Damn it!
He's very enthusiastic.
Maybe you should call the police.
Did you report this to the police?
You really think Tom's sick?
I'm not afraid of that.
I don't have as much money as you think.
I'm selling clothes on the Internet.
I could do anything faster when I was praying.
I didn't worry.
John, the tallest boy in our class, has the name "Mister of Highness"
Tom's leaving tomorrow morning.
I didn't kill them.
Do you know him?
I was, in general, all the same.
Tom's got a bad one.
I shouldn't have come here.
Don't make that oxygen face!
The white one?
Tom came first.
They've been heard strangely about them.
That's incredible.
The sky is covered with clouds.
This bird is under threat of extinction.
You treated her very well.
How do you live?
Tom seemed to be having a good time.
I'm all in the corner.
You said it was important.
He said he'd be back right now.
They have a lot of information.
Everyone in the forest called her Green Shapock.
I don't want to.
It's time for the kids to get some sleep.
You can enjoy this work.
I'm easy to breathe.
He won't be angry.
It's okay.
I'm afraid you have no choice.
Did you take the medicine?
Many people believe in corruption in our country.
Did he take his pants off?
I can't separate him from my brother.
We can count on him.
I'll go with her.
Has the phone woke you up?
I really need someone to bite.
I don't think Tom has any experience.
Come here now.
Last winter, I was in Canada swimming on the bed.
That's acceptable.
Tom says it can prove that Mary didn't.
I was born on January 2, 1968.
I want you to stay away from Tom.
Tom just got out of prison.
It's allowed to come in with animals.
Tom is full of hope.
He speaks French and, of course, English.
Get this stone out of here, please.
- And who's the happy picker?
I've been thinking about you all day.
That's good news.
I can't pay you.
That's what I found in the cave.
I think I made a impression on him.
It's about two minutes away at this station.
Come on, Tom.
I want to sleep with your wife.
What do you think would be the safest place?
I know your father.
I heard you screaming.
He's the guy who drew this picture.
Call up means calling on the phone.
Who would notice?
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.
Do you have a question?
They're in the woods.
I'm talking too much.
Show me the way.
The bright light of the sun.
The coral reefs are alive.
Tom said he knew Mary was planning to do it.
You never wanted to talk about it.
We hope for the best.
I didn't expect Tom and Mary to be here.
Last night the temperature dropped below zero.
"You can't wear it." "Why not?"
Tom was wrong.
I knew Tom wasn't in Australia.
My eyes are the ocean in which my dreams are reflected.
In a big city like Tokyo, I prefer to walk, not riding on a car.
As this has happened here, it's impossible to know now.
Now Tom has his own room.
I didn't know her first.
A lot of votes were made.
You lied to us, didn't you?
I don't think Tom can help you now.
He's probably coming soon.
He did not fully understand that such a differential equation.
I know that believer.
Be mature, Tom.
Can you distinguish Tom from his brother-in-law?
I don't get paid for it.
Tom took his sex records out of a broken hole.
Don't get up.
How did you know where Tom was?
She says she does it on Monday.
That's too fast.
The popularity of the phone led to the fact that fewer people today write letters.
I think we're almost ready.
The woman came to our town three years ago.
Is that why you won't help us?
My uncle's dead, and I'm really upset.
She's higher than sisters.
I have a pink car.
It's so quiet.
In the most beautiful colors are the toughest chips.
You'd better get back.
That's what I'm saying.
It's just not going to happen.
They can't afford it.
What colors do you like?
She says she feels very uplifted.
It doesn't matter.
Tom had a happy childhood.
I just got back from Boston.
Why did Tom run away?
Tom doesn't know how Iraq differs from Iran.
That's why they told me not to.
Two days ago, I caught up with the pony.
I was expecting him.
You don't have to do that.
Let's get some coffee or something.
You got something in your pockets, don't you?
Ask Tom - he's telling you the same thing.
He saw that helicopter himself and agreed to walk with his hands.
I'm with you.
Do you want to finish it like him?
I thought about him.
I'm waiting for someone.
Are you going to the theater tonight?
You have to protect yourself.
There's no conditioner in my house.
Tom and Mary are studying French together.
My boss is very happy today.
They blocked his proposal.
I'm excited about your girlfriend.
Tom hoped Mary would stay in Boston for some time.
Don't let me do this again.
Almost your turn, Basar!
You're ungrateful.
It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
I visited Boston.
I'm sorry, couldn't you repeat the question?
What do you think they're doing to Tom?
Ask Tom when Mary does this.
I don't want anyone to do that.
It's gonna work on these exits.
Give it to her, please, because I called.
No one could see us.
I knew I'd find you with Tom.
The President ' s efforts to implement more strict arms control once and for all have been interrupted by the influence of armed robbery.
I think we're familiar.
You don't appreciate Tom.
Don't worry, Tom.
I'm trying to say that in English.
Give it to me, please.
We need to talk to her.
Time's up to you.
We had to plan more closely.
You have to sleep.
I'm proud that my father is a good fighter.
You want to tell me something else?
Fomo has tried to explain the situation.
I told her it was a mistake.
He's her manager.
Tom didn't have it.
No one's been paying attention to me.
So that's when it was thirty.
I'm going to Boston on a bus.
Tom wants to try a new champagne.
There's growing up in these places.
You have to pay in advance.
Did you make coffee?
You could tell the truth.
She's just thinking about herself.
You usually talk too fast.
We both speak French.
You'll wear a pretty suit.
Who told you where to find me?
Who does Tom like?
That's definitely not what she wanted.
How did you break your finger?
Tom hid the fact that he was in prison.
We're more for Spartacus!
That's how he's been doing his business.
Why did he need Tom?
It's capital investment.
It's really hot.
Time didn't get it.
Did I say something funny?
Where's the knife?
Meg didn't even look at me.
You promise?
I know what you've done wrong.
It's time to find out.
I have to call him.
There's a lot to think about.
You've always been a winner.
Network!
I used to live on the Park Street.
Try to be there on Monday.
I've already read it.
Thank you.
Until certain conditions have been met.
She's not like everything.
Social networks allow you to find a lot of information about a person before you meet him.
What really happened in the past in Boston?
What Does It Mean to Learn?
These Persians aren't very sweet.
I don't think these black Fridays can be taken out.
I told you everything I had to tell you.
No, I didn't.
Let me pay her.
I can't forgive his tears.
Tell me you're kidding!
I'm a realist.
I heard Tom was expelled from school.
Tom said he was very lonely.
I didn't tell my friends I was going to Australia.
Kim's four years older than me.
Why aren't you in shape?
Tom just wanted to make sure you meant it.
Tom sent the daughter to bed without a knife.
I'll go with you.
They cleaned the way out of the snow.
Tom and Mary must do this together.
They offered us their help.
Tom decided to kiss the mask.
Are you very hungry?
What's going on with him?
Tom and I are friends of fate.
Where are you going?
I had blood in my hand.
You can't always win.
There's some kind of dementia.
Jimmy knows everything about cars.
I saw them all.
As everyone knows, he's a genius.
Cartina looks at the wall.
Mary said she'd win.
I want this dog.
Tom with you?
The boy's afraid of the dark.
I've prepared for him.
Russia has become a second sovereign.
I'm worried about them too.
He went to the mail to send a letter.
Get this shit out of the water cup.
Will you come with her?
Let's take one of the ready meals that are sold on the corner.
Tom tried to kill them.
She says she's happy.
You want to go beyond the border?
Don't blame the government.
Put it in place.
How did you get to know each other?
Who sent this letter?
Drop your guns.
What happened to the money?
The average rent per room in Manhattan is about $4,000 a month.
You can't find them.
Tom is the only one who survived.
Are you going to buy this car?
You're talking like my grandmother.
I don't have any relatives.
Let's see something else.
You think that's the exact translation?
I know Tom kissed Mary.
We both really wanted to.
That's why we're doing something here.
Try not to worry about us.
Stay here!
You've been very helpful.
Don't touch the door.
You must take into account his age.
I forgot to tell her something.
We forgot you don't like pizza.
Tom became convinced that something was wrong.
What if he's coming back now?
If you stop, sleep!
I'm afraid I don't have time.
You didn't know Mary was Tom's wife?
I need to go further.
Tom and Mary stopped kissing.
We'll have dinner on Friday.
What's your dad's name?
You don't turn off the radio?
I don't remember exactly what Tom said.
Tom is an art game.
I wasn't ready for this.
Look at that girl.
Tom has a vivid imagination.
He's got broken hair.
What are you talking about?
Yesterday you left the bar once when I was going to put all the drinks on my account.
Tom told me it was working.
I want to play in chess.
I support you for a hundred percent.
I haven't seen you for nearly three years.
You should tell her how you feel.
I have a headache.
I heard what happened.
We rarely have snow here.
Don't open this box.
I hate to wait.
Sometimes I see him in the club.
Tom asked Mary why she was crying.
It was fun last night.
Where did Tom take these photos?
It's useless to panic.
Hey, you know what?
I spent three days in Boston.
I'm sure he's hiding something from us.
Tom got him out of his leg.
Tom tried to move Mary to open the door.
I didn't do anything wrong.
You need to do more.
Only you can manage with money.
What about the other one?
I was able to do this much faster than Tom.
Don't shake the trolley.
Where did Tom sleep?
I won't tell you.
Why are you still here?

He's an earthly man.
I've never seen anything like it.
The trees give the shadow.
She was taken with the police.
Tom doesn't know where it is.
Tom doesn't know where Mary works.
I agreed with Tom.
I have so much to say.
The answer is yes.
I think Tom wants you to do this.
Tell me your new address.
You see me from there?
He told me.
Did you discuss this with Tom?
Tom took a cigarette.
Snow went all night.
The book was worth five dollars.
Many of them were children.
Love for money is the root of all evil.
Tom's on his desk.
Tom asked Mary to make coffee.
From a gun to a gun.
They went to the grave to pray.
He said he'd get it all, but he didn't.
It's okay, it's all right.
That's what it's all about.
Tom couldn't focus.
I like this place.
Tom doesn't have money on a new car.
I didn't know what happened.
They can't escape.
Obviously, you've been thinking about it.
He reads the newspaper every morning.
There's no calories in the water.
I think we should take them to work.
He doesn't need any advice.
You went to the store?
Please help me translate this document.
Tom's kind of insensitive to himself.
The plane's going to be dangerous.
I know two brothers, Tom.
That really helped.
I hope you're tied up.
Did Tom and Mary make a big difference?
I don't know when he'll be here.
As Tom goes to Boston tomorrow, our last chance is to give him that.
Tom and Mary don't want to dance.
We won't need it.
Tom held a gun in his hand when the police appeared in the room.
He can count the numbers quickly.
I thought Tom was incredible.
What's your father doing for a living?
When I met her in days, she seemed very happy.
Tom has no cats, no dogs.
In time, this event was forgotten.
That bitch was too small for me to walk in.
Okay, I won't be like that anymore.
Women were created to love them, not to understand them.
Tom was an animal killer.
I didn't want them to hurt me.
That's right!
Tom didn't want to waste any more time on the loss of time.
It changes everything.
Everyone here knows we can't trust him.
Get in right now!
You know the bus driver?
I believe you'll get everything.
You just need to talk to Tom.
There's a strong rain.
I'm aware of the danger.
My calculator's got batteries.
Help your hands, please.
In South Korea, the most influential member of the family, usually the oldest man, is able to send his family to a psychiatric hospital if he considers it necessary.

Add my name to the list.
Tom ran out of prison through the tunnel.
I wanted her to win.
Order now.
What crime have they committed?
At the start of the summer, he hit a bullet on the table.
I want to tell you myself.
Give me some time to think about it.
Could you please send me more information on the e-mail?
Let's talk about what's right, just not about it.
These are my shoes.
Can you tell me what Tom said?
That's not the case.
He's very fast.
May I?

I don't know how to prove I love you.
I wanted to get a bird, but it seemed so hard.
Tom couldn't believe Mary could be so stupid.
I kept my promise.
Please let me go.
You can say everything you want.
She's going to school on foot.
I saw it on Twitter.
Tom's not like us.
Thanks for saving me.
Tom said it wasn't the only reason.
Is that mine?
It's the beginning.
Who taught you French?
I don't think I can do it.
They're talking, they're taking the receipts.
I don't have any feelings for her.
So the teeth of wisdom have been cut off.
It's the last trip.
I'm going to the front desk.
Tom's not afraid to die.
What are you doing?
I've never seen her help her father.
That's where I know her.
I can't do anything anymore.
The English school started at 8:30.
Tom said I could sit where I want to go.
Strong legs.

He's a drone.
They're relatives.
Tom released another book.
It's all respectable.
What month were you born?
I don't think you're heartless.
It was a long night.
I'll get it for you.
Don't worry, it's just temporary.
You looked guilty.
You've never been like him.
I talk to Tom more often in French.
He looked at time.
I found it under the table a couple of Fridays.
I wasn't here.
It's gonna be all day.

I'm a big girl.
Tom and I are very close.
Who's fixing my mistakes?
The rule is rule.
You're going with us?
I stole Tom's money.
I wouldn't be living in Boston.
We're always under some kind of threat.
In this month, I have to cut costs.
I showed him my room.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary wants to go.
They are far from the truth.
So it'll be easy to win.
How many cars do you have?
I'm on my way.
Wherever you go, I'll follow you.
He'll love her forever.
I want you to sleep with Tom.
Electricity is very useful.

How's it going?

He was sober.
A big ship is a big ship.
For how long?
Bill Besbolist.
Tom stuck to Mary.
I'm gonna take care of it.
I don't think Tom has enough courage to do this.

Shall we start?
She needs to do something.

I had no idea you know French so well.
What do you propose for a replacement?

I'm glad Tom's gone.
Let's get out of the room.

Look what happened to me.
I'm eating this meat.
We have some ideas.
I'll show you a photo of Tom.

This movie is really interesting.
I don't care if you believe me.
Close the window before you go to sleep.
What do you think about this?
Tom was a bad student at school.
Tom hoped he wouldn't be accused of what happened.
I live in the city, but my parents live in the woods.
I want to share this with you.
Unfortunately, I don't have any money.
I'm going to buy a dog.
What does Tom think of your music?
Mary says it won't work better.
Something's taken.
I am against violence against women.
Do you understand what you did?
I'm sorry.
What did Tom do in Boston?
Tom said he was coming back.
I don't think that's as beautiful as John.
You fell into a trap.
Tom's in the baby's soul.
I was scared.
I forgot to give you a kiss.

Do you have a dog?
She found the key to my heart.
There's nothing missing.
We're counting on you.
Cats don't like water.
He fell under the rain.
What else are you doing?
Tom lived right in front of me.
If he doesn't come, what will you do then?
She was surprised that it was so late.
It's a shame what you can do!
I have a black and white dog.
I didn't know you were unhappy.
I would rather not answer that question.
Tom's probably gonna forget to do this.
He's late.
Don't be silly.
I heard his phone call.
You're very busy.
Tom can't give up on you.

Why are many language courses not effective?
How old were you when your family moved to Boston?

Is there anything in this box?
I'd better go home.

Why can't you do this?
Very small.

Tom's listening to the radio in the morning.
Two doctors were talking about things and their work.

I thought you'd be busy.
Can we wait here?
You're rude.
Tom cleans his teeth at least three times a day.
Tom was able to talk to women.

Who are you to solve this?
Put the bag down.

Do you want something?
She went before I came home.
Tom wasn't the only one who was arrested.
You'd like to make it!
You're just doing worse.
I think you should breathe a little.
He's a good man.
I can't guarantee that we will be able to finish our work until next Monday.
I didn't do that very well.
You really need Tom.
I appreciate her generosity.
Papayamento is a beautiful language.
I don't want to fight.
I believe in love from the first glance.
Do you remember what everyone's name is?
I'm his cousin.

A letter to you.
Uncle Tom couldn't read.
I'm not a doctor, but a teacher.
She said she liked him.
Should I go with you?
Give him a microphone.
Tom spent the night in the hospital.
I explained it to her.
Tom's unhappy.
German baton!
I'll take my leave if it's raining.
Everything has to be safe.
There's something else I want to discuss with you.
It's the tallest building I've ever seen.
It's the order of my hearing.
What are you doing tomorrow night?
Are you a musician?
It's been ten years since my mother died.
The mixture of three main colors is black.
Take care of yourself.
What time do you want to meet?
She doesn't like a new job.
I didn't want neighbors to see me naked.
Operation has been successful.
How long will Tom still be in the hospital?
I want you to meet her.
I'll let him pay for it.
You must respect them.
I'm going to Turin!
You didn't look stable.
I'll pray earnestly.
What will you do if the war begins again?
Tom said he's doing the same thing.
I'm not going to Australia this year.
The most famous gold liqueur is the California gold liqueur, which began in 1848.
You know why Tom doesn't trust Mary?
Show your photo.
I get to know new people every day.
I want to go see him.
You gave Tom a hand.
What are you doing in my room?
We're getting a hell of a fight on Tom.
He answered his parents.
Tom, are you there already?
Who did you give it to?
I held him as a traitor.
No one's asking you to do this.
I forgot that this is April 1st.
Please, hold on to this song!
Tom had a dog.
I know you left early.
Tom's been doing this all morning.
I know the consequences.
In the east and west, the river divides the city.
Why do you like it?
Do you know anyone who speaks French?
That's why it was terrible?
Tom invited me to stay overnight.
I don't think Tom's guilty.
I'd really like you to stay.
I'm impressed by your French.
We both want to do this.
If ice is burning, it's growing.
We could do that.
The doctor said he needed surgery.
I recently changed my toothpaste.
Here's something for you.
It's your bedroom.
Tom's realistic.
Who's gonna knock me in the door?
When and where did you and Tom meet?
I'm here to tell you.
I feel love.
Our team has returned home with a triumph.
I went one.
Tom married an older girl.
I heard him.
Why don't you sleep?
Did he come to you with a warrant?
Can you take a picture of us?
I heard you crying.
Show me how to do it!
It's all quiet.
Let the tower be taken.
Why are you so upset?
He got involved in his Chinese teacher, but with all these hormonal things, he got involved in almost every meeting.
I'm glad to let you know that I'm completely cured.
I wrote a lot of suggestions on the emperor.
I like Aquarel more than a shepherd.
I can't make an exception.
He thinks fast.
I can find them.
I'm here now.
You have the right to a lawyer.
Don't be too close to TV.
I'm my head almost every day.
To my surprise, he didn't read it.
You stole it?
She must be worried about me.
You don't understand, Tom.
My father likes fishing, like me.
Hey, it's me.
Dan showed himself to be a member of the white race.
I'm trying to get them out.
I like the color of your dress.
It's not me, I swear!
I don't think Tom speaks French.
My parents wouldn't understand.
I don't know what to do.
She asked me if she could use the phone.
Tom's better prepared than I am.
He's swimming like a storm.
Tom didn't tell Mary he needed to buy it.
She brought the metal.
"Tom, I'm going!"
I have a big problem.
We're not partners.
We have already faced this problem.
I'm trying to say it in French.
I'm not like anything else.
I was able to get two tickets to a concert.
He likes to boast about his father's successful car business.
She's in the sunguard's eyes.
Come on, Emily, you're waiting for your father.
How long can you sit in front of the computer?
Tom can barely walk.
Minus per minus gives plus.
In the basement of the body.
Please make a sacrifice.
I really need to talk to you.
Tell me something.
I prefer to travel on my own.
Ankara is the capital of Turkey.
I went to the kitchen.
I prefer a simpler approach.
They're classics.
I've been spending time with my friends.
Jane's apology really impressed us.
I'm trying not to read news.
What should I tell him?
You look awful.
I'm grateful for your help.
He couldn't hold his tongue.
Wait a minute, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
I didn't try to kill them.
Education is learning that you didn't even know what you didn't know.
Tom agreed to help Mary.
You should've thought well before making her pregnant.
Tom says he's not married to Mary.
I got two fish.
I think Tom's sick.
Tom's gone crazy.
I'm not hungry.
Professor Hadson is my father's friend.
Can I come too?
Is Tom working enough to live in the city?
Question finished.
Please turn off the radio.
It said he wasn't sure of his answers.
I heard about Tom and Mary.
Take your ass off if you're hot.
They're so many.
He couldn't handle the principles.
Mary says she's the only one.
You've probably got three hours to go.
It was a simple decision.
Mary said she'd come sooner.
I want to open my own restaurant.
You still buying lottery tickets?
It can be everyone.
One language is never enough.
Mary told me she was a Canadian.
You seem to suffer.
Tom forgot to tell Mary about dinner.
That's what people don't understand.
That's a rich idea.
Finally, she solved the problem.
The main thing is to tell the truth.
I don't want Tom to drink at our wedding.
It's all about work.
I had nothing wrong with it.
Tom keeps his room clean.
These three books belong to Tom.
He jumped from one topic to the other.
It's a dream.
Did you tell him I'm here?
It's inside.
It's not cold today.
I mistook Tom's dress.
It seems that the bank robbery was planned immediately before the milk.
So he didn't like it, but he just bought it.
Get some.
I want to talk to you about something.
The bank's empty.
Why didn't you show her to Tom?
Isn't the weather wonderful?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I bought it in the river.
Tell them to take off the tube.
Can you tell us what it is?
Say "no" racism.
Tom's a muscle?
Don't make me kill you!
How do you like it?
They don't respect him.
No selection.
I want you to be my girl.
Don't hurt us.
You can't answer.
Tom's got a lot of books.
Can you distinguish alligator from crocodiles?
Wait, is that what?
My grandfather built this house.
Do you want to take advantage of this opportunity?
You can't stay here.
I did this first today.
I came to Australia when I was a kid.
Do you really want me to tell you what you killed his father?
Your teacher called me.
I'm your father.
Can I have her alone?
All the people were traumatized by his word.
You know how dangerous it is?
He's running.
He's sitting next to his brother.
I'd like to meet him.
How old is Tony?
Can I take a shower in the morning?
Yeah, all right, listen, please.
It's made of wood or metal?
Excuse me!
I think Tom's my friend.
To be fair and free, the nation is to think of what has never been and will never be.
Tom's easy to learn.
Dogs don't differ colors.
He drew water from the bottle before filling it with water.
Dogs are faithful animals.
Tom's house was almost completely destroyed.
You're such a fool.
Tom knows you can't speak French?
At the lake of two boats.
I won't call you her name.
I knew it was a lie.
Better be one than a bad company.
That's false data.
There is a marked difference between them.
I know some of you think Tom's crazy.
I need to tell him he's not doing that anymore.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he's making a show.
Come closer.
We stayed in the Hilton Hotel.
That's why Mary must be telling the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.
Tom wanted to open the box right away, but I offered to wait for Mary.
She always complained that there was no money left.
You don't think you should call Tom?
Something to do.
She gave him a present.
Mary's working in the room.
All the attention!
In that second, I was in love with that language.
Is that safe?
That's what you ordered this pizza?
I need you to help me with this.
Tom's my close friend.
Don't do two parts at the same time.
You shouldn't have gone to the woods.
No one sees my tears.
Tom fell asleep again.
She likes you very much.
I'm glad you're still here.
These bottles are multi-colored.
Tom's never date anyone.
I'll tell them you've gone.
I'm listening.
I haven't been home since October.
I'm very happy to know you.
I didn't even forget about the congregation.
They had a wedding last summer.
He's helping me.
Hands down!
Everyone knows we didn't.
I thought Tom was never in Boston.
She learned to swim when she was five years old.
We asked the noise manager in the neighborhood.
I'm not gonna let you do this.
I don't think they heard us.
I thought you might need it.
Honesty is one of the virtues.
The next year, you'll meet him and do it.
There is no book in French in the library.
Every society is dangerous, especially that.
You could have stayed in Boston.
There's nobody there.
Can you write it down, please?
We don't think that's important.
No one understands you as well as I do.
Take care of yourself, you know.
You're gonna be able to jog?
You killed a woman?
We exchanged greetings.
Tom still wants to come.
I thought they weren't coming.
I don't carry the kind of animal suffering.
I think Tatoeba's a brake today.
Sally stopped her brother from cleaning the toilet.
In Mary's apartment there is a whole mess.
The conference is now under way.
Cartophile chips are good for your health.
I'm not as good as you.
I'm waiting for the birth.
I've never seen you so happy.
He made a deep breath.
I think Tom's right.
There's a hole in here.
You see the star?
Ask Tom.
Get the fuck out of here!
You used to talk so often.
Tom says he's not hungry.
That's always done.
Can't we take her?
An artificial satellite was released on orbit.
I'm absolutely serious.
Are you sure she's sick?
It's too simple.
What happens to our children when the nuclear war begins?
I told them the bank wasn't working.
Tom and I became friends soon.
He's got a problem.
I thought Tom was your best friend.
I'm so sorry about Tom.
Don't tell me what to do.
Documents on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about that.
Tom didn't tell us how upset he was.
I knew it was him.
Tom's working.
I'm not working today.
That's what you said last time.
I know it better than anyone.
I don't know what Tom's thinking.
I knew it was something like that.
You're hiding something, aren't you?
You're lying to me.
Tom looked very young.
The account shall be paid up to the first number of next month.
My French coward.
We need help.
You're afraid of her.
For me, Boston's cold city, not Chicago.
It was a victim of an attempted rape.
I can't talk about college.
Tom lives far away from you?
Why didn't I die?
The game is over.
You can check the karmans.
Tom's here yesterday.
I'd like to leave the call.
You chose not that man.
They took a good risk.
We have a white cat.
Maybe you'll never be able to walk again.
He was better before.
Tom wants to see us.
You weren't home yesterday?
If anyone can do this, Tom.
The meeting was cancelled because of the tiffon.
Tom was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2013.
On the way, she's got a high height with mollusks.
With grandparents and grandmothers Tom speaks French, and with parents in English.
I don't think Tom has enough money to buy a ticket.
Tom wasn't easy to find.
They're dancing!
I live with Tom.
I met them here.
You're not wasting your time.
Your problem is that you don't have patience.
Several events marked the 20th century.
Stop doing this, Tom.
Tom said he's not planning on doing this.
This university was founded by Mr. Smith.
I told Tom he'd come to Australia.
I think you could do that.
Tom said there can be no words about it.
He's getting out of bed.
The journeys are followed according to the schedule.
I paid for Tom.
There are many people who think that language cannot be spoken.
Why is Tom avoiding me?
Is Exam going to be today?
What motivates you?
He himself gave Lee his computer.
Put your hand down.
I was hoping you'd come back.
Do you think Tom would agree to meet us?
They say that anyone in America can be president, but it's probably not.
Tom never forgot Mary.
First, Tom's name is on the list.
What else did you leave?
Mary tried to calm down.
How long is the trip going to be?
How much is this trip going to Boston?
You didn't see that?
I need you to call me.
Tom never doubted that Mary and John met each other.
When I get rich, I buy a farm.
I gave him the money.
It's the neighboring country.
I called my son.
Why didn't she come yesterday?
Where can I sit?
You can't believe Tom told me!
I'll give you some more time to think.
Take it to French, please.
Take the cold table!
You need a cab.
That's how fast it's been.
Mary told me she loved me.
Tom told me what happened.
Kiss and kill.
I'll find her.
Did you think about what I said?
I'm very cold.
We're looking for you!
She loves everyone.
Compare your answers to Tom's answers.
Tom's weak heart.
That's why she'll have to pay for it.
I didn't know what to buy.
Can you put a karman knife on me?
Tom took his load off.
Did you see my dog?
Don't even try to do this on your own.
Nobody saw how you took it.
I'm half a Japanese.
Tom says he'll fix her.
You must come back.
We've already talked.
I can't believe I was finally able to do this.
Tom didn't know why Mary was pregnant.
Don't worry!
Why don't you just tell me?
What month is the thirteenth month?
I don't know which book to choose.
Tom didn't understand anything at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's going to a white boy's wedding dress.
It's the beginning.
I'll have to wait.
He was resurrected yesterday, not Saturday.
Anybody here with them?
They're watching over you.
How much time do you need?
I think Tom reminded me.
That's what we can do.
He knows about his shortcomings.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary's dressed in a black suit.
We ate in the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom never asks anyone for help.
Tom didn't say that to Mary.
It's okay.
There's a lot of prospects in this town.
What are you wearing?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to marry in the next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find a hotel.
She's not stronger than me.
You haven't told him yet?
She's got a double arm.
We can't force people to do this.
Let's get her.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I can't tolerate this color.
Are they sleeping together?
We're very grateful for that.
He can't believe he's still not married.
I didn't even know what you know.
I won't let her come.
We were welcomed by neighbors.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot at the bear.
I've never talked to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust him.
She's missing too.
I wonder why you need it.
I think that's suspicious.
I'm making a point that you didn't say that.
What are you doing on Friday night?
Tom's not the only one here from Boston.
Do you support me?
Why don't you like this plan?
I thought you were at work.
That's what you have to decide.
Are you ready to rejoice?
You're a friend or a enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
The winter is about to end.
I don't mean any titles or prizes for me.
Where did you find him anyway?
The meeting was delayed.
I know you.
Have you had a good time coming out?
Tom's drinking beer.
You don't want to do it. Don't do it!
Tom had a good job.
Is that good or not?
You don't remember anything?
I need enough.
Bring him a drink.
What do you want to be on these exits?
Get together!
He wants to be rich and famous.
She touched me.
He's afraid we're going to go wrong.
I can't call him home.
You had to apologize to Tom for your rude behavior.
Tom didn't tell me what the woman was.
The boy ran to his house.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Tom was a taxi driver when he lived in Boston.
It looks like an optimist.
He's not going to buy a camera.
I did my best to help him.
I'm joining you with her.
She's got the highest grades.
Tom can be exaggerating.
I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What color do you have for your child?
I'm in a hurry.
I work for the good of society.
There's people here who need your help.
You can do this.
I was a little scared.
It was used as a complete dome.
I'd like to heal.
Keep me books for a note or something like that.
I don't want to get out of the house tonight.
He'll be here today.
Cat's dead.
Only half of the nine now?
Tom went to the store to buy milk.
I'm not allowed to talk to Tom.
I'm not against you if you cook.
It's dangerous to swim in this lake.
I left my thumb last night.
Tom wanted to have dinner with me today.
Tom doesn't look very good.
She put herself in her hands to kill them.
Tom said he was glad you came back.
My car's covered with a deep smoke.
Tom doesn't know about my existence.
Tom found Mary's door open.
Lori's home?
I decided to marry Tom.
I won't make this mistake anymore.
I don't care if we stay or not.
I agreed to marry her.
I've been waiting all my life for that day.
What did they do to you?
He left the exam?
The plane came into the camp.
It wasn't him.
Do you have a friend on the list in Indonesia?
You might need help with her.
Mary's lost consciousness.
Tom wanted to play with you in chess.
Will you come with me to the concert?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had time, I'd be pleased to call you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where's your base?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do this for you.
"First," the robot said Tom.
Where are you?
I almost didn't die yesterday.
I'm sorry.
She didn't have food.
I don't think Tom knows how long.
They're running.
The road does not correspond to the number of vehicles passing through it.
You seem to be afraid of my dogs.
In the attack!
Look at the treasure.
You don't have to come to a meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new proposal as a message to the bottle: whenever it is transferred.
You're not gonna find a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
They all loved you.
We're relatives with him.
I have a virgin of your age.
I'm sorry I took your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I've never worked with her.
She's getting into her new office.
Let us take care of this.
I think you're sitting in my place.
I planned to do it yesterday.
Now a couple of oranges drink a drink, don't they?
My parents don't like my style of dress.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.
That'll be interesting.
I hit his boat and hit him hard.
Because what's worse?
It's worthless.
Can I get you a hand?
He's green.
Tom was shocked.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to break the cake?
Tom didn't lie all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about your goals.
The series needs to start to see when all seasons are gone!
Road accidents occur every day.
Where did you go to bed?
You were in Paris?
A prospector.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me a scarf hand.
The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I didn't sleep for two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You should find another way out of this situation.
Get out of here.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's just take a photo together.
I'm missing the exam.
They already knew about it.
You better go help her.
A football player made a huge mistake.
They're coming, too?
She sleeps like a young man.
Tom forgot to let the brakes go.
This song reminds me of a girl.
Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
The whole building was blown up.
Tom kissed Mary, and they woke up.
It's my cat.
Do you have any children already?
Tom didn't want to interfere.
They like Tom.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
Tom is a selfish idiot.
It won't let me sleep by night.
He was transferred to another department.
I guess you need help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let go of the cat.
I know you're all crazy.
Tom thinks excavating products is a sin.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place is going to be lost.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom about this yet?
I'll never hear you again.
I don't think so.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Let's go to church.
Tom's positor whiskey.
Was it hard?
He's responding.
I haven't met him before.
How long did he stand?
I need to see you right away.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
They're fishing.
I've been the same before.
Do you know the boy who's crying?
No one knew about it.
It's just amazing.
He said he'd never do that.
A thief steals a thief and a thief.
Don't you think Tom's a good sailor?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was just a thin man before.
How do we do that?
I can't believe Tom really doesn't want to go to Boston with us next week.
Don't let them go.
It's all right.
What day is it?
Let's give him another chance.
I just want you to accept me as I am.
I'm a normal guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Is that true?
Why don't you go in there?
Tom didn't say he'd come with us.
Tom died the day he died.
Tom and I must stay together.
I've only heard of him.
I'm not working here anymore.
What do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
Don't compare yourself with us.
I saw the car crash.
The window is here.
Tom is mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right for you.
I'll never pick my Pleisteshn.
I don't want Tom to see me like that.
Stay calm!
What's your favorite teletransmitter?
You want to go to the movie tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
It's Tom's day off.
Oh, my God!
I'm afraid you'll lose.
I like going to school.
I asked for help.
I'll be back to Canada tomorrow.
Thank you for your son.
Her father seems to be a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
Your dog.
What do you mean?
You can't share anything with that.
Tell him I'm going to go home to him today.
They need you.
It's Apelles.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Can't you see what happened?
I didn't want to worry about him.
The officer mustered up courage in his people.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm just thinking about trying something like that right now.
I don't understand very well.
I'm going to get a meat house first.
You're avoiding me.
Why did they do that?
Tom would have apologized to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many zones do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom soon became very famous.
All of this has already been known.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You shouldn't lie.
I know Tom's crying.
Mom, look what I found.
Interesting what Tom was thinking.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe she said that.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw how he looked at you.
Tom was kind of sceptical.
Tom must be home.
She was the one I thought about.
Tom showed the police his driving rights.
I wake up every month.
I told you I don't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to let them go.
It's apple acid.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new catalogue.
That must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go to the fishing tomorrow, I'll go too.
You're taking a job at home?
According to mythology, Prometheus had burned the holy fire to the gods.
Welcome to the world of physics.
I wish we could spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All passengers were able to get out of the bus before he got burned.
I want to help you deal with this.
You speak French better than me.
There's a lot of talented people in our town, but Tom doesn't care about it.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We're getting checks.
My bike's gone.
The stars were in the night sky.
I doubt Tom will win.
"Hey, you've got so much fun here." "My boy, he's trying to make it all..." "You and me, your Majesty, Hanon and his servants have captured the island of Cordea." "Hmm. What can we do?" "How can we write, how can Link get rid of Hanona?" "How can we do that?" "How can we do?" "How can I catch my sword?" "No." "A"? "A"? "The game doesn't!" --""" "The game is not." "No" -- "How do you see "A" and "No" -- "How do you see the bomb? "No."
You know who's gonna sing this song?
Your time's coming right?
I'll see you on Wednesday at 3:00.
I was at your wedding.
Tom's barely able to swim.

She's using a lot more success than I do.
Well, that's a tough question.
He did it himself.

I'm not running like a trolley.
I'm filming a movie.
He's got her love.
I wanted to see you again.
It's pretty high enough.
I don't remember how I did it.
I'm getting married next Saturday.
You're not coming with me to the concert?
Is it going to stay on the line?
I don't think Tom understood what he had to do.
Try not to cry.
Tell him to be here for half a third.
I've never been up to Fudzia.
What are you doing here so late?
She's not home.
I served in the intelligence department.
Kate's smarter than any other student in our class.

I like living with her.
Wait for her.
It's been a long time.
How's the new job?
Why do you believe him?
I know a little about that.
Maybe I should stay in Boston for a week or so.
Your key to me.
How much bigger do you need?
I see yours, and where are mys?

What's in the movie?
What is the advantage of this technology?
I think Tom's welcome.
They wouldn't let me go.
How did you do that?
I gave you what you asked for.
Boston has to look.

He made a weapon against me.
I was born in Boston.
I love fries potatoes.
So it was someone to tell his story.
You're old.
You've got a boring house.
I went away.
We're not gonna catch you.
We didn't do anything!
How many people died yesterday?
I'll get you brandy.
Forgive her this time.
Why do you have such big eyes?
I would like to ask you a few questions right now.
I only heard Tom playing piano once.
Do you hear me now?
I didn't order it.
Is he sorry?
They trusted Tom.

You don't think that Tom would kill himself, do you?
Her death was a powerful blow to him.
She's busy now, so she can't talk to you.
No way.
He likes it.
I just got involved.
I see men love women, and they give them only a little of their life; but women give what they please.

Many don't.
I gave her a letter of gratitude for her hospitality.
Who's the first number?
She said she wasn't very dead.
He slammed the tree with a torch.
How can you sit here and do nothing?

Use the smoke before it's ready.
I'm just eating meat.
I'm glad you came too.
When will you get your money back?

Mary is an outstanding artist.
I think he's right.
They all love money.
They went astray in the woods.
When was the last time you went?
I have a heart attack.
My father doesn't leave me in one movie.
I saw it as a boat tonette.
Instead of going to work, I spent the whole day at home.
I'll support you.
I didn't talk to Tom.
They decided to work harder.
It's not sold.
Who's your neighbor?
My dad usually watch TV after the wedding.
He's drinking wine.
Please, take off your apple pie, I've prepared it for you.
I mean, Tom didn't understand the question.
You have to stop her.
You'll make time for it if you come out now.
There were no special problems with Tom.
The darkness didn't hide it.
I invited him to work.
I'm sure it'll be easy to find a place.
I took from the headache two tablets of aspirin.
You're in my heart.
He took me to the last copy.
Don't laugh!
Love doesn't belong to anyone.
If you come to it now, you'll probably stop watching it.
I saw you in the park with Tom.
I didn't want to try them.
I'd better go find them.
My motorcycle broke down the road.
Tom made a seleph without a doll.
In what kingdom was this church built?
We'll soon be able to put you in jail.
I'm starting to think you're serious.
I'm not coming back anymore.
I'm sure Tom would be happy to help.
It's Joanna.
I made so many mistakes.
How can people do such things?
So I'm really sorry.
I like your eyes.
The rainwater runs through this hole.
I've always considered Tom a close friend.
I'm one of the girls who've got more friends with guys.
Don't worry, I have insurance.
He'll be here with me.
It's hard for my father to drink.
No one's offering you to take care of this.
He works in this company on Monday after the resurrection.
Mary forgot to stop the car.
I'm old.
Tom went with Mary.
Tom started laughing.
I'll call him tomorrow.
Tom has telepathic abilities.
Who's the nationalist?
Tom sat with John in one room.
I didn't want to swim.
He drank a beer.
In our time it's harder for a man to be... himself.
I'll never talk to him again.
Shh, Tom, wake up!
I'll keep my nose paychecks.
I did what I promised them to do.
I'm a new teacher.
They're all children.
She came out of her house and cried at me.
Did you take your medicine?
The hunters are very nice.
She doesn't trust him.
Time on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
You like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
You wanted to tell me something?
I doubt Tom's still worried.
You'll be better tomorrow.
What do you want to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Do you feel the smell of the pale rice?
That's not what happened here.
When will your father come home?
I get it.
Tom quoted Mary's book.
I'm trying to help them.
I'm just getting out of my soul.
Toma's patient.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom and Mary are not married.
It's trying to escape.
You're standing up.
We're champions.
Tom's deaf.
Tom said it wasn't enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring the salad to dinner.
Her hair is darker than the pot.
I'm just buying a soft toilet book.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom lives in the field between the door and Mary.
How do you know how much it's worth?
A board manager is a complimentary master.
Tom is married to Mary?
All the skiers in the park were busy.
Someone needs to tell her that.
I've got everything to do.
Vermont is on the border with Canada.
He had to live in a room with his brother.
I didn't imbecile.
You're gonna do it, right?
I can't heal.
He's got a brother in Tokyo.
The dynamics elected Alfred Nobel in 1857.
We have to get involved.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
You can leave if you want.
I know you shouldn't do that.
I suggest you let them go.
Take my glasses.
I've already talked to this student.
What is the chemical symbol of the bromistodial acid?
We have a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in the back of the bed.
I asked Tom.
That's why you need to talk to a lawyer.
I think you should do this.
Knive!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed as a courtman.
I respect his views, even though he disagrees with many of them.
The sky is in the center of the city.
Who sent you?
She tied him up with a sweater.
I don't think Tom wants to go with you to Boston.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
After nine calls?
You don't have to go.
Put him in the field.
If only I could come with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You don't get them?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We didn't have a chance to win.
Are you planning on staying long?
We had a quick meal, and then we left.
There's a big garden behind the house.
You're right.
Careful, don't ruin yourself on your feet.
Make every meal with soup.
I'm afraid to be one.
What did she do to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you actually call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He lived directly against me.
The bell was opened.
I brought the wine.
I'm not popular.
It's his first day at school.
I want to meet you before I die.
She's beautiful, too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I propose another strategy?
They died.
Big apples.
You didn't know Tom was living in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about it.
She's coming?
I need to go to the toilet.
I'm a doctor.
Tom listened with interest.
I think they're happy.
Do you understand Tom?
Let's go to the car.
You're kidding me.
She was interested in the taste of his loss.
A good trainer trains this command.
The tree is sick.
The trip was delayed because of a strong snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
What did you take from me that I don't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book?
It must have been you.
Mary left me in the bathroom.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
You live there?
What would you have done?
You don't know her?
I didn't ask if Tom's planning on doing this or not.
I'm falling.
I couldn't come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom's wearing a new suit.
Last year, she learned to ride a bicycle.
Help us.
I don't have to thank you.
Since it was winter, he didn't go out on the street.
I've seen my friend on the street.
How many houses on your street?
The elephants are made from the elephant bone.
I'm not a kid anymore.
"How's life, Mike?" "My name's Tom."
Her French native language.
It's a bad coat.
She stopped smoking.
Tom was married then.
I bought this book.
Innovation is its only positive quality.
My hobby is the collection of natives.
The boy Tom lived in Boston.
I didn't eat six days.
Can I tell them about it?
She kept quiet all day.
It doesn't matter what he can say, don't believe him.
I've gone further.
Tom and Mary hope their next child will be a boy.
Mary's always very welcome, and she has a nice kiss.
I won't let her die.
In all cultures young people are buried under the cobalts.
It's the best restaurant I know.
You could know a lot of them if you just listened.
What should I have done in that situation?
I'm sorry he broke you up.

It's amazing how quiet it gets when snow falls.
Tom helps women.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd be back.
For many people in India, cows are sacred animals.
I've got an idea.
I thought we could do it.
My mom was against me to walk alone.
I'm sorry, I didn't get you that way.
You know what you're doing, right?
You can't trust the machine translation.
She hit me, not him.
You won't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
This river is full of fish.
His success was nothing but a miracle.
We're with her.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had these symptoms?
He's released.
What did they say happened?
You couldn't leave the door open?
That's what you're gonna have to wait for.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's two older than me.
Tom knows they were wrong.
A mild climate in Japan.
Check again.
Don't judge Tom.
My mom finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let him do what he wanted.
He replaced the wounded game.
Tom said he doesn't believe that.
Our trip has been very smooth.
It's inevitable that once I go to France, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, it was almost noon.
It's just getting sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on taxes.
That's what he's looking at.
The rain stopped. You can open the window again.
I've never had that before.
I don't think Tom's gone.
I was going out when I called.
I don't have to endure it.
Always get in the way of the right.
We are asked to present ourselves.
I would like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
Maybe she's good, but I don't like her.
I can fire you if you want.
Tom told Mary she was wasting her time.
Do you still have this problem?
I never asked her.
Nothing weakens like a hot tub.
I don't really have much time.
How can I cancel my marriage?
There's a book on the table.
I'm sorry, I totally forgot about that.
You're not sorry.
She's my lover!
The sound of your voice is like a sweet song of cheese for me.
How's your marriage?
I thought Tom could help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?
Tom knew why Mary didn't like it.
My fingers were left on print glass.
Chemistry is remarkable science.
I feel that my French doesn't make it much better.
How can I get a passport?
Maybe you can help Tom.
Tom is the best drummer I know.
I didn't know Tom was your boss.
He needs you.
They're ready.
Tom didn't pay any attention to Mary all day.
Tom's got fat hair.
Tom doesn't want to sell the house, but he doesn't have a choice.
Let's get some more light.
I gave my sister a word.
It's my father's car, but she'll soon be mine.
You forgot what his name is?
If I had time to do this, I would.
You see the boat, Tom?
Big photo?
This medicine will help you.
Stop laughing.
I've got a bad life.
You know how I was involved?
Tom has become what he's been doing.
Someone trust me.
She's a "Sex in Big City".
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Get in touch with him.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do this?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
Christ works, stop!
Nothing compares to a stuck beer after a long day of work.
What happened?
Tom left his bag.
Here are a few interesting facts.
How much time do you need?
Let's breathe here.
Are you in the new boots?
You can leave if you want.
Did you find the book you wanted?
That's what my mom said.
She cut the grimson when she saw the dog.
He's not above me at all.
Stealing is strictly forbidden.
This Persian is beautiful.
You see?
Tom's not in trouble.
You shouldn't have gone to such a dangerous place.
Good job!
You've often said that.
Here's a few letters for you.
It is virtually impossible for a scientist at such a level to make such an important mistake.
He doesn't have any evidence.
You look bad.
He was a very good sailor when he was a young man.
I'm writing to a friend.
He's very good at playing tennis.
She put the students in the wrong direction.
She said she was a Canadian.
Don't talk to anyone.
And when did you come to tell me?
I didn't want to tell you that.
I filled the kitchen floor.
Go straight.
I'm too tired to think about it right now.
What house are you living in?
I told them it wasn't nice.
What do we live for?
Will there be rain today?
We know about her.
You could help us.
I don't drive a car often.
That's why I don't like the end of the movie.
Just get inside.
Just apologize to him.
I'm trying to protect them.
Tom did a great job.
I'm two of you.
I didn't know it was legal.
I love adventures.
Tom's in the library.
So you were in school?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who it was.
Why didn't you wait for us?
I didn't know.
Why didn't you drink with us?
You're good enough?
I've decided to forgive Tom.
I'm starting to enjoy myself.
It'll be a big snowfall tomorrow.
We decided to move to the next meeting.
She thinks it can prove it.
When was the last time you played golf?
Are we poor?
I don't know Tom's name.
We have the same dentist.
Not all Brazilians like carnival.
I don't think Tom knows what's going on.
Who did Tom sell his car to?
Tom's smiling.
I have to earn money so I can buy a computer.
Don't laugh at strangers.
I don't know them.
If you could choose genes for your children, would you?
That's why Mary and I have to breathe.
He's easy to sleep.
It could have been worse.
Tom did his part.
Tom doesn't know where Mary's key is.
What kind of book are you looking for?
I'll sleep a little.
You'll ever be there.
Tom's having a good time with Mary.
- You owe me money. - No, you don't.
He came up and stood on his knees.
You don't have to go there if you don't want to.
This song always reminds me of my childhood.
Did Tom do this for you?
I don't think Tom knows I love Mary.
He says he's rich.
Tom works three times more than Mary.
I drank milk.
It'll be snow tomorrow.
Isn't life amazing?
When it comes to preparation, no one is equal to Mary.
You're not yourself lately.
Tom lost his leg when he attacked the shark.
I'll drink it for you.
We'll do it as soon as possible.
Next year, I'll be three times older than you.
Can you tell me what happened?
Show me your collection of marks.
It'll take forever.
Tom's definitely above Mary.
Yeah, it looks like nobody knows.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.
How did you know who to give it to?
This dog will fit into your skin.
I fell in love with you.
It's almost winter.
I think Tom lied to me.
We're all very proud of her.
Tom's parents told him not to.
Tom and I were surprised.
I'm fine.
Tom decided to give up a professional guitar game.
Now I'm married.
It was a couple of times.
This time you went too far.
It's working.
You're going to meet Tom before you leave?
No wonder Tom answered.
We want to take the apartment to town.
They spoke French.
It's so expensive.
He won't come any more.
I didn't know what else to do.
They haven't slept yet.
Tom's a couple of holes above Mary.
I'm glad you suggested it.
It's hard to answer your question.
You don't believe her?
English is the world language.
It sounds simple.
Can I get a copy of these?
I just told him to leave Mary in love.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston when he was a kid?
Tell them what I told you.
Tom's looking for work.
Why do you need a baby?
Stay with me, Dad, I'm afraid of the darkness.
The situation is getting worse.
I choose where to taste.
Tom decided to buy a new car instead of a new one.
I just wanted to make you a success.
She's broken up.
I won't let you take my kids away.
Don't give them to him.
Run, and that's what they arrest you.
Mary said she was very tired.
Tom set himself up to meditate every morning.
Did you check your accounts?
He tried to build a short story.
A stone without a book, like a body without a soul.
Why did God treat us so badly?
What's your brother doing?
We need a volunteer.
Why is Tom so sure it won't happen again?
I haven't seen you in a hundred years.
I told Tony last night.
It's easy to make impressions.
You're old enough to do this on your own.
Aristotle believed that the earth was the center of the universe.
It's interesting that Tom actually meant it.
No one understands me.
There's so many stars in heaven, I can't read them.
They all came back and looked at us.
Let me see.
The white bears live in Arctic.
I told you I'm the best of all.
I told you Tom wants to go to Boston.
Tom doesn't have to ask for something in a couple of times.
So today, let's get the man who's lost in the bummer.
I don't know what I'm doing!
I would never do that.
Have you ever been to Boston?
He's a Russian fugitive, at least he told me so.
Tom's a third coach.
You'll stay long?
I'm not a woman.
She's got a great father.
The trip was over.
The house is beautiful.
I think I'm starting with a beer bottle.
You don't know Boston?
Orchestra started to play.
Mary was in a pirate suit.
It's not my wife.
Why didn't you mention it earlier?
Tom didn't want to be a bully.
He was born on June 5, 1970, at seven o’clock in the morning.
I'm afraid your plan won't work.
Jane and Kate are close relatives.
Tom's just a white meat.
Thank you for helping me.
We have all three rules.
She bought one of her own.
The guard didn't see Tom.
In recent years, Tom has been a remarkable asset.
I helped carry those bags.
They've got plenty of time.
Fifty-five is equal to seventy-five.
I live in this hotel.
I don't want to know anything anymore.
You still don't know what he'll say.
My hands are fixed.
I always stole a woman.
Finally, she did it.
It's a burning shame that they weren't saved from the fire.
We've got money.
Examen was split into two parts.
When are you going to tell them?
Tom didn't want to talk about his illness.
Hey, you guys are so cute here!
Reading the book is like traveling.
Tom saw Mary enter the store.
Why aren't you there?
Tom said Mary's almost won.
The Japanese would never do that.
I don't like Boston so much.
She's always writing letters.
I don't know who to consult with.
Turn left to corner.
Tom taught me to do this.
You can do a lot more.
Give me one, please.
I'm not bringing disobedient children.
That's what Tom bought me.
What you said, everybody's upset.
You're too small for that.
My parents have been married for 30 years.
She showed her talents.
I'd like that to be possible.
I guess you can't do this.
I thought I was alive.
Bob's next school festival will play a major role for the first time.
You must remain in shape.
I've been hunting seeds all day.
By the way, I realized he was an American.
Maybe it's a problem.
Was that a joke?
Be merciful!
Tom's down.
All my generations think of it the same way.
I live for it.
You're gonna be able to go to bed?
He's got a lot of lands.
Well, they're happy.
He told me he was very happy.
My dad's gradually getting excited.
You'll feel like home.
It won't end well!
He looked like he wasn't eating for a few days.
I didn't ask you to go there.
Who's Norman Finkelstein?
Get out of here!
If it doesn't sell goods at home, maybe it's a new way to get acquainted with girls?
Tom chose the coin.
Why didn't you go to your room?
If God doesn't, it's all allowed.
We're both called Mary.
I knew I had to get married for him.
Are you still at work?
New?
Don't take anything as well.
You're time.
They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please step aside during the landing and landing.
It was Tom and Mary.
We both love marine products.
I've been waiting for a long time.
I rejected the proposal.
You want to come with us?
Tom didn't.
I have too much time to explain why it doesn't work.
Nothing has changed.
You built all this yourself?
I'm looking forward to summer vacation.
Can you make this second?
From here on, he looks at it.
Woody houses are easily depleted.
Let's get him to dinner.
The song's still alive.
I want to go to college.
I know you've got it.
Blood is very comfortable.
I'll make this report tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's down.
I want to hear your side.
I'll wait for his coming here.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know the size of Mary's shoes.
I need to think about it.
The meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.
My name is Jose, we're friends.
You forgot to mention that.
We don't need it anymore.
Can I have something to eat?
Tom can do this without our help.
All ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who set up the meeting?
I'm such an innocent guy.
Tom wants to fix it.
I'm not going to have fun tonight.
Mary was the only girl in the hole.
What bird can't fly?
This has to be done.
Tom didn't answer right away.
Tom died in 70 years.
Life — It Is Worth Living!
Tom speaks French, too.
The creation of a transistor was a new era.
I'm not in love with Mary.
Did you hear what she said about Alexia?
You look like a girl.
Here's a few photos.
What's going on in ten channels?
I hate spinach.
Mom's preparing dinner.
Tom is a palmer.
What can I do?
She's a genius.
I know you saw terrible things.
I know a few Canadians.
He's willing to give up his emotions.
We were forced to know about his death.
Why didn't they leave?
I didn't see you.
You're just finding out clearly.
He had cancer.
You're guilty of what happened.
He's just like time.
I know where you're going.
You understand everything on the flight.
Let's blame him.
Let's leave it till tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he tells us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do this.
I don't like it.
The locker stopped talking.
On the writing table.
I don't want to be late for work.
You're not kidding anymore.
Tom was a busy smoker.
Tom's got a piece of paper.
It's hard to talk to Tom.
I was born in Finland.
Tom didn't want to help me.
Tom said he was worried.
Tom's not used to it.
I'm interested in who's gonna help him get a snowball?
I still don't know why Tom did it.
Do you believe in family life?
What the hell is that noise?
My son has a hereditary disease.
That's disgusting.
Is that snow?
I'll call you back.
He dropped the glass.
I don't know if there's a world where you can marry your dog.
The best protection is the attack.
She's getting married this afternoon.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it would be easier.
Can we help you?
Is that clear?
I had five avocados.
The Japanese live on rice and fish.
When are you ready to go?
The investigation began last year with the confiscation of human computer archives from the German city of Magdeburg.
What's life like?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
What did you decide you couldn't do?
We went back through Boston.
Who's gonna believe that?
Thank you for correcting me.
With the mind?
The stars appear at night.
Where did Tom get that hat?
They wanted proof.
Tom's got his car.
Tom can't get on the bike.
I'm not talking on TV at all.
Why did Tom come in?
Why did you want to be a teacher?
I'm afraid of wild animals.
How much more money do you need?
Mary laughed at the tears.
I spent $500 a day.
Tell them to go home.
No matter where he is.
They didn't make it in time.
Now seventy-seven.
I see you've been crying.
I want to know who told Tom that.
Tom got up early to see the light.
The dinosaurs died long ago.
I usually climb through one step.
Tom left that year.
I'm around the station.
Tom's a very good boy.
You're drinking?
Are you from Boston?
Put it on my desk.
Tom got out of the water.
I was very proud of that.
You were ready.
You know Brother Tom?
All the hunters can take off the eggs.
You'll pay for what you did.
I've got everything out of my hand today.
I asked them to stay away from that.
Only 30 learned to drive.
I'm glad he didn't hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed so long.
The kitchen knife was hard enough to break the meat, so I used my perforated knife.
Honey, I can explain everything.
You'll soon be able to adapt to a wooden life.
Hold some water.
You're no longer a child.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We're all cool.
There's a river deep in here.
Thank you from the heart.
I told you a hundred times.
I'm very cold.
I'm sure you should tell Tom.
They died.
Tom and Mary got drunk.
The writing of individual words in cases where they must be written is a major problem in Norwegian.
What are you doing with the rest of the rice?
She died ten years ago.
Tom met Mary a year ago.
Anything else you need?
We left soon after that.
This book should be read.
Tom and Mary made lessons to the corner.
I don't want to drink your tea.
You're always so romantic.
A woman can't walk — you can't walk.
I'll go after you at 6:00.
I teach him French.
I love learning other languages.
Mary's got eyes on her.
I'd like to know how long Tom's planning to spend in Australia.
You didn't know I couldn't do that?
How did you feel?
Let's give Tom a chance.
I like fruits.
Tom did it.
He's selling cars.
Are you still in touch with her?
"Do you think he'll come?"
Tom didn't expect Mary to win.
I hate sick food.
I'm here.
They shot at me.
She knows her husband's psychology.
We have to check it out.
Tom gave Mary a kiss.
He couldn't believe his eyes.
They took the first bus.
Let's wait till Monday.
Does anybody know them here?
Here, it must be a mistake.
He can't afford to take his leave.
I'm used to breathing.
Tom didn't want anyone to know.
How was the day?
It's your fault.
I told you when to come.
Of course, I kept my promise.

Let's get closer to the deal.
Tom sat on the stairs.
What else does Tom want?

I want you to talk to him.
You kind of said she was yours.

Tom was the only one in the pool.
I'm studying French on my own.
Tom couldn't answer all Mary's questions.
Tom is teaching my children French.

It's hard to live with Tom, isn't it?
Have you ever seen Tom dance?
Tom asked me for advice.
Tom started crying.
I'm sorry. I'm sick of her.
He'd never hurt me.
She wasn't sick.

You'll never get it.
Without your help it would be impossible.
No one can stand before Tom's promise.

Tom's birthday tomorrow?
That's why I came back so quickly.
I don't even know the words in Hungarian.

The only question is how much money we need.
You think it's possible to drink?
Go after that red car.
Don't you give me a salt and a drink?
Do you want to wake him up?
Sometimes I find it difficult to speak French.

You'll call tomorrow?
Tom said Mom never loved him.
Tom's weird.
That's why I didn't like this photo.
You haven't seen anything lately.
I advise you to go to the bus.
Let's wait until we hear what Tom thinks.
You're still coming?
You're too low.
Don't touch my car.
I don't remember telling you to close the door.
Who taught you how to ride a bicycle?
Don't forget to pay taxes.
Have you ever been to that restaurant?
I was hoping to meet Tom there.

Did Tom tell you about it?
The soldier died.
It goes there every morning.
You're not holy either.
It's an egg.
We were both scared.
It's hard on me.
We'll start without you.
I mean, it's not mine.
We already have one.
This is very dangerous.
You didn't exactly say that?
The head is usually nearly a pig.
Not everyone knows what to do.
I don't love torturers.

When I was a Canadian!
Be careful if you go out.
In your place, I'd change the tires.
I haven't been late for the trip today.
I'd be careful in your place.
People are very scared.

Tom told everyone to go.
In order for your shop to succeed, you have to sell people what they want.
Didn't Tom talk to you yesterday?
He likes to watch multiple movies.
Our wedding next Monday.
Where would you like to sit?
How often do you clean the boots?
Are you all the doors closed?
I like to go with Tom on a fishing trip.
I know you're careful.
No one in health would have done that.
What if Tom isn't home?
Do kids have to work?
I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.
I think I know it's that way.
They're the road.
Tell us what happened, Tom.
Let's wait till tomorrow.
I just called in and left home.
I don't need it today.
Your proposal is better.
Do you know how to tie the gloves?
No one asked your opinion.
I want you to apologize to Tom.
We have to wait for them.
You're so funny, you're kidding me.
I'm sorry, sometimes.
You didn't see my cell phone?
Your name and address?
We need more beer.
Tom left Mary a short message.
You should've started asking me first.
She watched him and other boys playing basketball.
Tom patiently stood in line.
Tom went to school with his feet.
Did you get up yesterday?
I don't like cold in the winter.
Someone's in the pool.
You're not yourself lately, are you?
Let's start as soon as he gets here.
You're a Czech?
I always treated her with respect.
Look at that car.
What's the blood coming from?
They're talking, she's a good doctor.
I could do this without your help.
Be firm.
You need to go there alone.
Tom lives on that beach.
You don't have needles?
You know what Tom's growing up?
You can leave yourself a scarf.
Before the birth of a nation in stores.
Three hundred dollars was not enough.
Tom ran into the water and drowned on that beach.
Tom will be there forever.
Frisian is a national minority.
Did you get up today?
Never raise your father's hand.
Did anyone else see you?
I'm ready, are you?
Who took my bag?
I was in the same class.
Tom's weak.
You're too young.
Tom's looking for you.
Tell him he shouldn't do this.
There was mail here earlier.
How could you kiss me?
Sorry, I don't know what to say.
Do I need permission?
Tom said his mom never loved him.
Tom told you his password?
Reese still left?
You already bought tickets?
We don't care how old you are.
Coffee today is something weird about taste.
No one called Tom for dinner.
Come on, let's try and get Tom there earlier.
You already did what I asked you about?
What if it doesn't work?
You've done everything already?
It really doesn't have to do with this case.
There were only a few people there.
I'm interested in where the eyes left me.
A man like Tom, love it's not easy.
My room is the same size as yours.
Bring them here to me.
It was a heroic effort.
Have you ever tried the words of Tom?
If she knew her phone, she could call her.
Tom's gone to court.
You're acting weird today.
It's fast growing.
Are you talking to your neighbors?
There's a beautiful way out of the castle.
Tom told me I wasn't in my business.
I have no idea what Tom's got.
Then he became afraid of you.
"What is this tree?" "It's deep."
Sometimes I don't understand my father when he talks to my grandmother and grandmother.
Is Tom doing this more than Mary?
Remember what Tom did.
He won't say anything even if he's being tortured.
Ask me if you don't understand.
I live on that beach.
Why shouldn't I tell you what to do?
How would it be better to say that to the emperor?
They say a big poet lived here.
"Can I have a drinking water?" "With gas or with gas?"
I thought it was just a warning and a punishment, but they punished her on the whole program.
Tom often admires Mary.
That's why Tom's gone.
The arrest of Tom was not unexpected.
It's a lot of food.
My younger sister did all the exercises and slept.
I pulled you out of the list.
Call us if you hear anything.
Many of us don't know what to do.
Are you a good French Tom?
Sit down there, please.
I must have stolen the key on the way.
I'm talking a little bit more Hungarian.
I was hoping to meet Tom there.
How many days did Tom get sick?
Tom, is that what the fight is?
That's why there's no bright flowers coming.
Tom couldn't hide his anxiety.
If you see Tom, please tell us now.
Tom likes tea, and so do I.
Please check your translation.
You should try again.
No one was laughing at Tom's joke.
There are many examples of this.
Yeah, you can go to the movies.
You can leave it on my table.
Are you ready for battle?
Have you ever played poker?
Remember: Patience and discipline.
I was faster.
She's the only woman I want.
You need to stay calm.
It's just a statement.

This flower can be.
Who told you what you can do?
Tom lives with a supermarket.
The fish came to the surface of the water.
We saw three men.
We don't need it now.
No one at the moment understood what Tom was thinking.
What clothes do you like to wear?
How many years do you know Tom?
If you're not careful, the police will catch you.
I used the knife when I cut my hand.
You're not like Tom.
Did you give her my address?
I don't like winter, so I have to choose from the warm bed.
That's why I love riding on a bike.
You didn't see my cell phone?
What are you eating?
As a result, he was able to save himself.
Some thought that the end of the world would come at the end of the millennium, others in 2012... but we're still here!
It's better to sleep than to drink a bird than a bull.
It's interesting what Tom would say if that happened.
Why should we lose?
I introduced Tom to my friends.
I want you to apologize to Tom.
Isn't it too early to work?
I've never learned Croatian.
What's your method better?
That's yours.
Show us what you've drawn.
I saw Tom about recently.
We went out of school together.
Did you find that replacement?
The sooner they do this, the better.
He's using silence tactics.
Let me drive you home.
Find out what happened to Tom.
I'm free now.
Tom hoped for the best.
There's someone else here.
I'm allergic to oranges.
What is the matter with you that you wait for?
Tom won't help us.
I can't live in Venus.
Check, please, your translation.
It's easy to make mistakes.
You don't hear very well either.

I don't want to have anything to do with Tom anymore.
Tom's been missing all the time.
Where did he learn Polish?
Tom's got a reputation for justice.
Good thing you didn't go.
You can take my car whenever you want.
Everyone doesn't know who Tom is.
Tomorrow's even better.
Start thinking, then talk!
Who lived in this house?
It doesn't look like you're so worried.
Our class has grown.
Sloans are strong animals.
Out of my house.
Crocodiles depend on their water supply.
She's running away.
Tom's sick, so he won't be there.
Tom's not sure what he wants to go.
Tom loves his father very much.
I don't understand my own feelings.
Maybe no one's gonna notice.
That's what Tom bought me.
It's Mango.
The correct answer was not obvious.
Put the trash in the skull.
Mary was born a trinity.
We've got the same idea.
Maybe that's why you just need some attention.
Tom died a year earlier than his wife.
That's why it doesn't work like Mary.
Let's hope we're not late for the trip.
Why don't we go early?
There's no one here. Everything's gone.
Why didn't your friends come?
You're always like that.
The meeting extended to half a third.
Tom and Mary were upset with each other.
He's trying not to go out at night.
Tom forgot it was a day.
I don't have anyone to leave Tom with.
I'm afraid I'm slow, please, support me.
I spent three days in bed.
I hope what you're saying is true.
Tom said he couldn't wait a long time.
Is that what you found?
Do you like it here in Berlin?
Everyone had bicycles.
Mary is my hero, not my mother.
You can't answer that letter.
You won't mind if I put my hand on you?
Tom didn't listen to Mary's speech.
Is that your tea?
I could do this without your help.
He's staying here in Boston.
Where's your cell phone?
Tom assured me he'd be there.
I'll take you home.
You bought it today?
And you will not be able to stop laughing.
I seriously don't believe that.
Good thing you didn't go.
I don't have anyone to leave Tom with.
That's why your name is not on my list.
I didn't know he needed help.
You haven't said anything to Tom yet?
Let's go to football.
Tom is there as a volunteer.
Come back in three days.
Talk to your children.
I do the same.
Tom said he can't wait that long.
How many books did you read at school?
I worked as a teacher for fifteen years.
You think Tom can't do this?
Did you see my cell phone?
You would have done the same thing in my place.
Tom convinced Mary to stay in Boston.
You have someone in your number.
It's starting to bother me.
Let's meet tonight.
Are you sure you can see Tom today?
Have you been to Tom yesterday?
That's why I didn't like this photo.
Did you hear that?
Go back to the first lighthouse.
Tom's got a demo.
It's all ours here.

Tomorrow I'll be 30 years old.
Why are you going so fast?
We live in the city.
Tom, I thought you were dead.
Did you get caught?
You were riding on a bike yesterday?
I'm sorry!
Can you get the fish?
I was hoping this would happen.
Do you really think Tom will help you?
What, you don't understand?
I'll ever be a famous writer.
Who built your house?
I hope Tom was punished.

You're not your own lately, are you?
How many years have you and Tom known?
Did you find anyone who could replace Tom?
Did you get anywhere today?
Tom doesn't have a lot of children's photos.
I'm sorry, but it's my rocket.

We need to try to do this in a different way.
Say what you want.
Life here is so expensive.
Earlier, Tom had gone to church every Sunday, and now he's gone.
My plan was simple.
Tom didn't see anyone there.
Time's almost gone.
Get out of this country.
Try to understand Tom.
I did everything we agreed to do.
The stone Tom looks like a pigeon.
The knife's good enough.
This letter is not obliged to answer.
Let's wait till tomorrow morning.
Look at my dog until I'm gone.
Maybe we'll see you soon.

Bring them here to me.
It's hot.
Did you notice how much Tom grew up?
How long have you been talking to Tom?
Have you seen Tom since?

It was a very expensive meat.
The fight was dishonest.
So we don't need our help anymore.

I'll help you, and I won't.
Tom wanted to take my car.
Last winter I read a lot of interesting books.
Tom betrayed us all.
For more than three years, I've been living in this palace.
Was that really necessary?
I have the same big room as you have.
We'll still see Tom.
The kid's got a little ear.
He plays with dogs every morning.
Who actually called?
Tom, can't you lend me $30?
Before I get out of the house, I'm always late.
It's interesting how many people there will be.
My daughter helps me get to the kitchen, she's a very good assistant.

Does anyone know about him?
Um, yeah, half here is made of half.

We're not doing anything right now.
Did you see my cell phone?

Someone's gonna have to tell Tom.
I'm only working in the exits if it's necessary.
Tom and I played on Monday in tennis.
I'm not going to listen to you.
Every time I see you, I must remember your mother.
We're done again.
I need to stop getting so drunk later.
How do you translate this proposal into English?
I know the way.
I took Mary for her sister.
We didn't know about that until yesterday.

You chose a present yourself?
Not all my friends like to swim.
We've gone a long way.
Did you find anyone who could replace Tom?
Why don't you ever be happy?
What are you doing there?
When you don't need people anymore, they just make you look like an old joke.
We're starting a new life.

Sometimes I find it difficult to speak French.
I'd do the same thing in your place.

We're out of ice.
That's enough.
She doesn't like anyone.
How long will Tom stay?
Would you like to add some milk to the tea?
You won't give me a salt and a drink?
This case is far from the end.
Is that a joke?
In the presence of the Chief, he should be considered as an employee.
I knew Tom would tell me everything.
You think they'll let us do this?
I never told myself that she stole my money.
I need to know why you bought it.
I've seen this movie a couple of times.
