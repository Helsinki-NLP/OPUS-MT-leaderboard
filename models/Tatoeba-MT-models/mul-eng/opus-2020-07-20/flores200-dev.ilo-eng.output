The modern ice skate sheet is two layers and there is a space between the roofs. With two roofs, it is easier to hold the ice sheet, even if it is similar.
Because beneath the surface is a curved curve, the roof is similar to that on one side or on the other side, and it is similar to that of the ice.
So this is why the scatters go right. If the cuts go to the right, the scatters to the left, while the cuts go to the left, the scatters to the left.
To return to their former energy level, they had to remove the energy source they had received from the light.
