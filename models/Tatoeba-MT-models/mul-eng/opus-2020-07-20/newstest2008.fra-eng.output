Inflation in Europe has fallen on food
The accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, the price increase in the 13 countries of the euro area was more important than the forecasts, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, indicated the Office of Statistics of the European Community located in Luxembourg.
The official forecasts indicated only 3 per cent of Bloomberg's communication.
In contrast to the US, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the director's interest rate by saying that the decrease in interest, with the increase in prices of raw materials and the decrease in unemployment rates, would lead to the generation of an inflationist spiral.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below but close to two per cent.
According to an analyst, it is the Catch 22 for the ECB: "It is necessary to discourage inflation" in order to no longer intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent is a record over the last 12 years and in Spain, it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has declined due to the rapid increase in food and energy prices.
At the end of cereals, the market share increased by 88 per cent and the soybean course has also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and milk products has also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world oil price increased by 52 percent and, last month, a black gold barrel cost nearly $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the inflation rate will go from 2.1 this year to 2.5 per cent but in 2009, it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the rate of inflation in 12 months remains around 3 per cent, however, the average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent in the next 3 to 4 months.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to decrease the management rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stay, the number of Fidesz (Young Democrat Alliance) participants has increased significantly since December. Since 2002, it has now had the largest number of participants, while Gallup (Social Research Institute) has never seen such low socialist support before, namely 13 percent.
For the faithful voters, the difference would represent, due to the greater determination of the opposition electors, more than two thirds (71 percent) support against the support of a fifth (20 percent) for the Hungarian Socialist Party.
According to the survey, the MDF (Fourm of Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Free Democrat Alliance) are below the level of parliamentarians: they support two percent of the population.
On some faithful voters to vote, the number of participants in the two parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate continued to deteriorate as compared to the above, and the proportion of those who judged that the country's economic situation was particularly serious has never been so high, it has risen to 41 per cent and 46 per cent in addition to the situation is quite serious.
After the most optimistic perspectives of the spring and the last summer, families are more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population is planning an increase and only one tenth is planning to improve the situation.
In December last, 71 per cent of the respondents, namely a majority who had never seen during the previous Gallup surveys, decided that the prime minister was doing his work rather badly than well.
13 percent of the polls have trusted or much trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent did not trust the Prime Minister, and 27 percent did not trust the President of the Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political change is the proportion of society, thinking that the satisfaction of the Prime Minister can be treated without change of government.
While 35 per cent of the polls wanted the Government and the Prime Minister to remain in office after the end of October, this rate is currently only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believe that the holding of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
On the question of the intention to vote, 60 per cent of the polls replied that they would certainly vote and 20 per cent of the additional said that they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to organize next Sunday", only 55 per cent of the polls would surely participate and 15 per cent would probably participate.
74 per cent of people would not be entitled to enrollment in higher education, 79 per cent would not be required for consultation and 84 per cent would not be required to stay at the hospital.
When we look only at the same proportions among the people who expressed their intention to vote at the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of registration rights, consultation fees and hospital stays.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by nearly twenty percent
The hypermarkets introduced in the Budaörs trade triangle maintained the average price increase of 16 per cent of the last year to the difference that this year's VAT rate did not increase.
Article of the Napi Economy (Economy daily)
This year, in the Budaörs trade triangle, the usual Christmas Panier also increased by 16 percent to an average, an increase of a net value of more than a thousand forints was shown in all hypermarkets.
The prices, "which were already involved" in the major food stores in December last year, have not increased sharply compared to the previous high base.
However, consumers are obviously shocked to see that the items bought purely below nine thousand Forints last year now cost more than ten thousand Forints.
The daily Panier in the sound hypermarkets exceeded 91 Forints, at least ten thousand Forint's psychological threshold.
And the highest value of the panel was 10,573 Forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
The prices of the Union and of the living fish remained almost at the level of the last year, but the prices of the dindé, the night and the pavot increased significantly.
In stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data from the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, bread was found in a kilogram of bread only 139 pounds.
The competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 Forints.
It was amazing to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the two-litre bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 Forints, so it was not worth 257 Forts of the assigned bottle.
This year, at the end of Panier daily, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora was the least expensive.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of his Panier daily by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by approximately 18 and 18 percent respectively.
By comparing the last year's coolest pane and the last one's smallest ones this year, we find a difference of 12 per cent while the difference between the last year's least cold and the worst of that year is 21 per cent.
Prices increased by 1,480 forts on average.
Last year, prices increased by 1,206 averages, while bearing in mind that the impact of the increase in VAT rates was already noted in Christmas prices last year.
This process has simplified trade, and the hypermarkets could not clearly determine which margin to apply on products as long as they were unable to predict the impact of change in consumer prices.
(If a trader calculates the rotation of a product, it is likely to lose a large profit on the market adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
As a result of the change in the VAT rate, the increase in the prices of the daily Panier was so excessive that the worst panel was more than 1,720 for the 2006 value, while the difference between the smallest ones was not more than 844 for the 2006 panties.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the fairest value of the basket was over 1,630 for the last year and the prices of the smallest for the last year also increased from 1,284 for the same.
As Christmas approaches, we have seen a catastrophic increase in prices, and in less than 20 months the prices of everyday consumer goods have increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH's data: for some first-needed food, the Statistics Institute has found a price increase of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, the flour and the oven.)
According to the Panier daily of this last year, this seems almost absurd as the price level of this product, already well over 10 per cent in the last year, has increased to more than 10 per cent compared to the base.
According to the indicators, flour suppliers take a position stronger than egg suppliers because they have succeeded in accepting the brutal increase in prices as well as by multinationals.
In the trade gold triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experience, most customers no longer look at the prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take the food of long conservation by pallets.
Wednesday mornings of important issues were formed in the caches of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, the number of business is less important in the province, many multinationals complain to research companies not even to reach the number of business planned, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer products.
Many hospitals make the economy of disinfectants.
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the misuse of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
The health conditions of hospitals, the lack of beds, the overcrowding of medical personnel do not help prevent infections, says the doctor in charge of the National Center for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals also make the economy of disinfectants.
There has not been a long time since an MRSA infection was diagnosed with János hospital traumatology.
The antibiotic resistant bacteria have been detected on a hospitalized man following a serious accident.
The disease was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injury of a serious car accident is from the hospital, but soon after it has returned because of an MRSA infection, and since then doctors have not been able to perform an important operation because of the bacteria in its body.
Until 10 December of this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resistant pathogen agent were reported to the National System of Noccomomy Monitoring, Karolina Böröcz, a doctor at the National Center for Epidemiology.
It is known that this is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen agent who has actually been registered in hospitals, and for the rest of us, we have no information.
About two thirds of infections (683 infections) have been caused by the MRSA, i.e. by the anti-methicillin-oxacylline-acillin-responsive golden staphyloc acids.
One third of the people are carriers of Staphyloccus gold (SA) bacteria in their kidneys without developing a disease.
The infections caused by SA (such as angina, amygdalitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, which are readily treatable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacteria, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a highly resistant bacteria that will rapidly spread into poor hospital conditions.
In the event of poor temporary or prolonged operation of the immune system, this bacteria may cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or septicaemia, on the elderly, small weights or weak organisms.
According to the director of János Hospital, there is nothing special about the MRSA infections, these infections are part of the hospital's daily routine.
There is no need to confuse the infection with the epidemic, there is no MRSA alone or there is no search for it, said Tibor Nyulasi.
SA resists antibiotics.
"These diseases are isolated, the care staff putting rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics adapted to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
In particular, hospitalised patients are examined if they are carrying MRSA, but the infection cannot always be avoided.
The removal of the sample is not in the mode
The vast majority of the infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogen agents, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs especially in hospitals and in elderly residents, hospitals should control hospitalised diseases and immediately isolate MRSA's portable diseases.
However, microbiological removal is not the mode in Hungarian hospitals.
It is important to know that the National Social Security Fund does not fund these reviews.
In most cases, only if the MRSA infection is detectable on the disease, the doctor in charge of the epidemiological center has declared the disease.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the management of certain infections and diseases.
Efforts should be made to target antibiotics, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take into account.
The implementation of microbiological removals is even more rare in ambulatory and basic care, Karolina Böröcz reported.
Many hospitals make the economy of disinfectants.
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA spreads from one disease to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put gloves and protective masks. However, important defects are detected in hospitals as well as in this area.
The MRSA is spread by infection transmitted by inhalation of gouttelettes and by contact. However, because of conditions in the Hungarian hospitals, the contaminated disease cannot always be isolated.
In addition, rooms are often full, beds are often too close to each other, while patients should be away from each other at least 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, we also note that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, are making savings on the disinfectants, lack of nurses, are numerous diseases, and the risk of contamination is even greater, Karolina Böröcz said.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures, the number of infections is less demonstrable or the spread of pathogens may be blocked.
Government Project against MRSA
The treatment of the MRSA infection represents exorbitant costs for social security cassettes, which is why we fight this infection all the time.
In England, for example, the Government has set up a programme to prevent or reduce the impact of MRSA.
According to the data published, this program is effective and the MRSA infections show a devastating trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) shows among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogenic agents (such as MSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, the author of a fatal accident, was not in trouble.
The official record of the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd rounding was drawn up.
It may be excluded that the Commissioner of the 22nd rounding, demissioning from his post since, who had broken a pit by causing his last Tuesday's death, had been in a state of irritability or darkness, had communicated on Friday attila Morvai, the spokesman of the Ministry of Public Affairs of the Capital after the relevant status had been established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before being released.
Last Tuesday, the former head of the 22nd round commission broke a 55-year-old man who was facing him when he turned, with his personal car, into the 22nd round street of Kossuth Layos. The man wanted to cross the road without passing through the passage for piketons.
(In addition, the fact that it was crossing the road outside the pedestrian crossing does not constitute an understatement condition, according to the Road Code, a vehicle which starts a storm must let the pedestrians pass.)
The pitton died after being transported to the hospital.
Following this incident, the Commissioner withdrew his position and requested his resignation because, according to the police communication, the incident had caused him much trouble.
The investigation on this case is conducted by the Park of Budapest's investigations.
Attila Morva also mentioned that the former Commissioner cooperated from the beginning with the judges responsible for conducting the investigation.
EUR 400 million additional for infrastructure
János Veres, Hungarian Finance Minister, and Marta Gajecka, vice-president of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements in Budapest with a total value of EUR 400 million on a credit line to support education, transport and the environment and energy infrastructure.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the financing of Hungarian transport and environmental projects from the Cohesion Fund with a credit contract of EUR 100 million has already been signed by the parties. This time, the signed contract concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement also concerns the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, the remaining EUR 150 million will be used later, following the extension of the credit contract.
The parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million for innovation, and the state budget will use this envelope primarily in the context of the research and development project to be implemented at Debrecen University.
In negotiations, draft line 4 of the Metro was also addressed.
The parties agreed that they would re-examine the possible modification of the initial contract when Hungary had finalised the details of the metro financing with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has allocated €8.4 billion to funding 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB shall grant its appropriations according to the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a period of 8 years without a commitment committee.
Bulgaria, the EU’s real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, and the attention of Europe as a whole has been turned to this country of the Balkans not mentioned in the past.
What, or who buys on this EU market that is always the least expensive but who will soon become?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in the real estate, Bulgaria is the most popular destination in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses on the market.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamproro and Vitosa and, on the sea side, Albania, the "Sabbles of gold", the "Côte del sun", the former Sozopol and Nessebar, but more and more are looking for an apartment in the Kavarna and Balcik region as well.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also increase the interest of the investors and they will also be increasingly able to buy in the less expensive area of Russia.
Sofia, capital, offers attractive opportunities as well, trade and office areas promise the highest amortisation rate.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of Europe's most attractive golf paradises and thus to be a priority destination, after the summer season and winter season, also in the two other seasons of the year.
The most cautious investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the region of Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy an apartment in Bulgaria are looking at the same time to change their life, their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more from Romania.
The Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. Along the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we usually meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers divide into three groups, says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who are planning to install are buying renovated furniture, at a price ranging from EUR 50 to EUR 100 million, or at an old rented house, at a price of between EUR 5 and 15 million, which is then refurbished.
The criteria are easy access and communication opportunities, the proximity of a large city, stores and, in general, that of the local doctor.
The second group includes secondary resident buyers (since December last, Bulgaria has been mentioned among the first 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who are looking forward to achieving a medium-term or long-term value.
The price of capital property increases without delay because of an increasingly strong demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years, they have increased by 21 per cent each year.
The increase in real estate prices is significantly greater than the increase in wages.
Fodor and six hundred Hungarians
According to Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Waters, the meetings of professionals will take place on Tuesday, but Wednesday, after official opening, the negotiations of ministers on the international climate system will continue after 2012.
Experts and political men from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap designed to define efforts to be made after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At present, there are lively discussions on this subject between developing countries and developed countries.
The United States also noted that they did not currently wish to discuss accurate figures, but that they were ready to sign an agreement on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 from 25 to 40 per cent compared to 1990 levels.
Another important issue of the Conference is whether developed countries are committed, without emission reduction, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on assistance to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a Governing Council composed of 16 members likely within the framework of the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF), Piac es Profit (Markhe and profit).
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister for the Environment and Waters, reaffirms the EU's ambition to maintain its role as a ship's vessel in global efforts to protect the climate and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by 20 per cent to the 1990 level, regardless of the success of the signing of the 2012 Agreement, and that it was ready to reduce to 30 per cent if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also willing to take appropriate commitments to their responsibilities and capacities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, Kyoto's signatory countries had totalled a decrease of 5.2 per cent and the total of 15 EU members at that time had committed to 8 per cent less.
Hungary has undertaken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared to the period 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfil its commitment, recalling the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The challenge is large in Bali because the long-term international climate policy agreement must be put in place within the two-year period, but the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce below the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system that was highlighted in the new IPCC report, international scientific bodies, which received the United Nations Nobel Peace Prize for Climate Change.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the increase in earth's average temperature of more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army recruited on YouTube
The British Army units, on the video sharing site, communicate recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with a view to becoming popular.
First, it is the British Air Force (RAF) that has been passionate about YouTube: the special units in Afghanistan and the video sequences on Taliban operations since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These registrations, with the help of small-scale cameras mounted on the cache, are controlled at the headquarters of the Air Force Operations in Kandahar and are then transferred to London or to the compatriots on the Internet.
The political message is irrevocable
Air Force soldiers have already spent 139 sequences on the net this way, and their "chain" has been viewed by more than 75 thousand people.
The Department of Defence has been registered as "defenceheadquatters" in early 2007 and has reported videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Department of Commonwealth Office and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission and Afghanistan
According to the original objective of the Air Force, videos were passed on the net to recruit. According to the Department of Defence, they also served to make the actual objectives of the presence of the army widely known to the public.
The propaganda published by this way is virtually worthless in relation to regular television recruitment advertising, which is communicated to BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant. On the contrary, it also inevitably carries a political message as it justifys the well-founded military operations decided by the Government in a special way.
The Americans made a game
The army is embezzled because, despite the carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos are passed on the distribution site that also presents soldiers' death: in the "official" propaganda films, a few hypocrisies, officers do not avoid talking about losses but never present the bloody side of the fight.
In addition, many videos were already on the net presenting operations areas in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out in a real mission, but the British army has only been engaged in carrying out these videos for a while.
The Americans are recruiting a little differently using the American's Army's game of fusion free of charge. In this game the player can be placed directly in the position of soldiers in a more or less real simulation.
Noël tombola and benets in departments
Monika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold an end-of-year meeting with her colleagues who will say goodbye to 2007 by taking benets and coffee.
Another department will organize a party with live music, another will show officials with a tombola and will offer a glass to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Festival, Christmas ambiance, concerts and buffet, thus enjoying power.
Public authorities are also preparing Christmas.
This year, the largest Christmas festival will be organized by the Ministry of Defence, but it is not the employees of the Ministry who will be invited to attend.
In Noël, the Orphelins, the children of the wounded soldiers will receive gifts for the missionary Christmas, members of the families currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The Department provides for a budget of 25 million Forints to create an end-year environment.
In comparison with other ministries, the National Development Agency (NDP) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will attend.
The GKM party will be held in the Future House with a total budget of 4,320,000 forts and, over six hundred large employees, three hundred and fifty are expected.
At this festival, the Christmas environment will be rigid, there will be actors and also a tombola.
The NFN Christmas cost 4,700,000 forts and was hosted in the National Justice Council building (OIT) with concerts and dinner.
The rent of the room cost a million Forints, the rest was spent for more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, an NFN service is invited to another Christmas festival organized with European money by the National Economic Development Centre, a supply management company.
The building of the Theater of the Gâteau was celebrated for these purposes.
This information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt because we failed to join the responsible.
Custom is not mandatory
The ILO building not only welcomed the NFW but also the Ministry of Justice and Police who, instead of a Christmas festival, organized a ball at the occasion of St. Luca on December 7.
The ILO has not made them pay for the use of its rooms.
That was five hundred people.
The party began with the Minister's welcome words and dinner was followed by a lively music evening.
Answer to the question of [origo]: having dinner was not mandatory for this ball.
Departments of Health, Labour and Local Communities prepare a super party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and party to its employees, in its walls, for 400 000 Forints.
On the other hand, Monika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite his colleagues to a Christmas party but to a working meeting at the end of the year.
Hundreds of people are expected to be invited to take a coffee and eat benets, the press service has been announced, the party will not cost as well as 350 000 Forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Communities, will simply invite his colleagues to take a glass in the hall of the Ministry of Local Communities and territorial planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will host a Christmas festival in its large room, where 436 employees are expected.
It is worth spending 2,500 Forints per guest including a buffet and a glass.
Since the arrival of Janos Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas each year in the same way.
Not only is the official nature of the planned holiday environment strengthened by the Minister's exhibition but also by the time of the holiday that took place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will host a reception on January 20 to celebrate the new year, the Christmas celebration will not be held.
The reception will take place at the Vajdahunyad castle, located in the City Bois, and according to the department's communication, 1,000 people per person are calculated for hundreds of guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are accompanied by a few welcome words from the Minister following a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate Christmas, they have communicated to [origo] their respective press services.
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas festival.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the event organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The strengths of the grey mega gather together
The trade union unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will be their committee on strike on Friday, which will be responsible for the coordination of the fixed-term strike on Monday.
Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and Monday, the day of the final vote on the Health Cases Act, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly lead to important gaps in the movement as rail traffic will be stopped almost entirely and BKV employees (common transport company) will also become rough up to 1 p.m.
The Link Syndicates will find out, Friday afternoon afternoon, details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The LIGA-MOSZ strike committee will also be formed, and will serve as coordinator of Monday's actions.
Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they do not reach agreement with the Government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote to the Parliament on the Health Cases Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health case law, unions will immediately withdraw the appeal to the strike.
On the contrary, if the law is voted, the strike committees will meet and then decide to take action.
According to the order of Monday of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the Health Cases Act was not held until late at night.
Due to Monday's drought, important gaps are planned in circulation: railways will stop work for an indefinite period of time and during the morning a part of the common transport in Budapest and more than half of the Volan companies are at risk of being arrested.
At the same time, at different points of the country, half of the road will also be blocked.
Many civil unions and organizations have joined the strike call, and the list of them has been updated continuously on the League's website.
Some organizations report that they have been crying for an indefinite period of time, others have declared a temporary termination of work.
Until Thursday after noon, the MÁV (Hungro Railways) and the Free Chemical Syndicat (VDSZZZ) have failed to reach agreement on minimum services, or, near Christmas parties, more and more are those who take the train.
According to current communications, the common transportation of Budapest will take place from the start of service until 13:00, Budapest's airport will run between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the Industrial Energy and Thermal Energy Syndicates of the League will be held four hours. The trade union of teachers and the democratic union of teachers have called for a strike to take place at 2 and 2 hours to 8 hours.
The National Association of Doctors will be arrested in all the country as an alternative, the Health and Social Sector Syndicate (EDDSZ) which is scheduled for the SZEF will be sent two hours of notice.
The most important of the four claims made by the League requires that the Government withdraw its proposal on health reform and submit a new concept to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating the deduction to be applied from the next year is introduced in several stages.
The third claim seeks a guarantee, in relation to early retirement before the legal age, which would enable the system to carry out its functions prior to 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Chemical Syndicat (VDSZZZ), attached to the League Syndicats, the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on secondary rail lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard has increased the risk of countries
According to the Division for Risk Analysis of Political Capital (Rish Analysis Division), the activities of the Hungarian Guard, which was established in August last, with the support of Jobbik Magyarszágért Mozgalom (Movation for Better Hungary) increased, in several respects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its “risk warning”, the company reports that, in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the biggest political risk is already that “in the short term of aggressive ethnic confrontations can result in the deterioration of the already existing ethnic tension between the population of the Tsigane and non-Tsigane of Hungary”.
The Research Institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy, which is likely to cause this situation, is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "public actors have held the public debate on the Roma case with representatives of radical and extreme political groupings which have based a political strategy on the difference between the Tzigans and the Hungarians".
The problem is compounded, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and aggressive conflicts are more likely to occur, they say.
However, according to the research institute, the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media to the activities of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly reduced Hungary's image abroad, particularly with regard to the country's confidence in the stability and democratic maturity".
They recall that, following a greater publicity given to the reorganization of the Hungarian radical and extreme rights groups since the autumn of 2006, many associations have been established in Hungary since the summer of 2007 giving the name "national self-defence association".
“The common tradition of these collections is that they are defined as a civil organization while they publicly declare the preparation of their members to defence missions (dangerous, national defence, order defence), armed if necessary, to increase, by citing police, military, or state incompatibility,” they added.
They noted that everything was going on according to the method that, based on the well-being of policy society and the parties, seeks to eradicate different political ambitions under a civilian dimension.
The emphasis on the character of civil society and the status of association is therefore not only to avoid the legal aspects of the registration of such associations in court but also to be a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activities of the Hungarian Guard are a factor that also increases the risk of nearing relationships.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries refer to the Hungarian Guard as a potential risk source and the ultranationalist political actors of certain border countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the Hungarian Guard's constitution.
This affects the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard, for example, is similar to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (NBN) in August 2007.
The many problems of Rome that have arisen in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are the origin of the Bulgarian Guard.
On the basis of these events, the UNCCD decided to establish a guard by stating that the organization's objective is "national self-defence".
According to them, for the last 17 years, the Tsigans have "terrorized" Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had led to lively discussions in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations on the establishment of their own resistance guard indicates an increase in the risk of ethnic confrontations.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not preclude the Hungarian Roma from reacting to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defence, we can read in the warning of the risk of Political Capital.
At the request of the telegraphic agency, Attila Juhász, the research director of Political Capital, said that the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year, and if events could have an impact on the risk change, they will inform the public of their opinion, as in the present case, by publishing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the days of the festival and, around the parties, it has become ready to reorganise the working days in which the number will decrease next year.
Festivals are no longer uniform in the EU and in the United States.
The Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holiday days as well as holiday days.
Days of rest are often related to religious festivals or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that ends, and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, the last of which is so much more so that the awakeners can rest peacefully.
Also, in one year, we have 11 red-marked parties.
The 15 March is a national festival, in memory of the 1848 revolution, as well as on 23 October, which is the memorial day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, on May 1st is the festival of work, and on November 1 and 2, we remember our family and our dead friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or other religious festivals rarely fall on a weekend, according to the calendar, he has become accustomed to reorganizing the working days in cases or only one working day before or after the red-marked festival.
It is true that we pay the price of long-term weekends by working or going to school on Saturday before the long-term weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has established a special regulation on the days of replacement of the previous days or following the festivals.
The Act extends to all employees and to all employees, employees and persons working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to services companies, institutions returning without interruption and service, by their occupation, and also for days of rest.
This year, the working days will be changed only around the end of the year: from 24 December, life ends almost all over the country because, according to experiences, most people do rather than spend extra hours or take vacations that they have saved for these purposes so that they can spend the days between Christmas and the day of the new year.
The next year many holidays fall in the middle or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days than that year.
The calendar will be reorganised for the first time around the work party to allow employees to stay at home for four days.
On Saturday, April 25, it will be a working day for a rest day on Friday, May 2.
Another change is planned for October 23rd: Saturday, October 18th will be a work day replacing Friday 24.
On the contrary, the next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, the whole world will take a break without stopping even if the day of the new year falls on a Wednesday.
Six subtle things that can scare your colleagues terribly
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that touch us almost more: these are things that "smooth" every day of a job.
The question is whether we are accustomed to these disadvantages or we are facing the challenge and we are deliberately avoiding the ambiguity, causing damage to others.
Examples.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you we called you from the marketing service," said one colleague.
What did you do for a date?
It is best to apologize and try to arrange things by calling the marketing service to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (it is the most current solution).
In most cases, the matter is settled with excuses.
Before having criminal explanations, it is helpful to reflect on how you can cause unpleasant moments to your peers and make efforts to avoid them.
Do you push something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more exciting than wanting to get a file, a office tool or a phone, and you don't find them anywhere.
You remember that guard you put the graph on the desk, but she disappeared the next morning?
Did you find out about your style that you thought you lost on your colleague's office?
Don't do anything to your colleagues without asking, but they have reason to be angry with you for having hurt their property.
Don't worry about it, put it in your pocket because it can be empathizing that it's gone and that you need it all the time.
Your colleagues' private life bosses?
There are no good ways to stop the forces that promote themselves.
Who did what, with who?
Why not?
Don't tell the whole world your information (suppositions) about the privacy of your colleagues!
If a colleague shares his secret secrets with you, don't lose his confidence!
Please include the information shared and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence, even if your colleagues are also present.
Did you just say you're sick?
When you call the office and tell you that you are sick under the pretext of a headache because you feel bad or you feel you need some rest that day, think that your work, your urgent business, your end-of-life missions must be carried out by someone else at your place.
Don't make jokes to your colleagues!
If you know in advance that tomorrow you won't work or that something can happen that would require you to stay at home, don't forget to prevent your boss and your colleagues from getting surprised by your absence tomorrow.
Freuding, enriching, phone
You're stuck in your work, but your colleagues' wealth is driving you madly?
You've become a witness to a phone discussion that you'd better not listen to?
Do not disturb your colleagues with colds, singing, high-voice discussions (which you handle above their heads), foot beats, big words or dissatisfactions expressed with high voice.
They can worsen even if your colleagues are not involved in a project (reading, design, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
If your work is not done for the fixed time, you forget to send an important e-mail or message, don't blame anyone for that!
Don't put it on the account of any chaos in your office or your ex-girlfriends!
Know if you have made a mistake and if this has caused inconsistencies for others, repair the mistake!
Ask how you could fix your mistake, fix the negligence!
Are you feeling too much at your office?
Adding a jogging and shoes is comfortable at home but they don't fit in the office!
Do not put comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Do not neglect, respect your colleagues and yourself by properly dressing you, and if your function requires it by wearing nice and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to answer the wait, you're no longer interested
We move slowly into the usual mouth in the morning.
At the same time, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin to which electronic effects are associated.
I'm going up to the sound.
The music changes rhythm and the low comes to accompany the tone of everything at the time, then a female choir has joined it as a real bee.
Mr.2 broadcast the song Wings of Love from Zagar.
The Hungarian music life has not put us in the mood for a long time with a good quality electronic pop.
But now it seems that the mouth becomes different if you listen to the new Zagar album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few new interesting products born from the Hungarian digital background, start slowly to change the overall image, and despite the new mode of the garage rock that opened the guitar, the Hungarian electropop shows that there is a new under the sun.
Balázs Zsäer arrived from Pécs and he played himself in the Yonderboi group before he left on his own way, perhaps because "there's no place for two feet in the same cage".
His project (Zagar) and his music, a jazz alliance, electronic dance music and pop, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of film tracks (e.g.
The season of Ferenc Török).
The early training in small clubs began to be known by a larger audience when the van2 magazine mentioned their first album in 2002 among the five most important discs in the Hungarian market and announced by Zaga, with Yonderboi, almost the only Hungarian producers who would also be competitive in the west.
Zagar and his entire group became undisputed "trendy" but no one asked them if they wanted to take this label well.
The group responded as necessary, released a new and better disk.
The album entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, recently released, can open new ways for them, although the title wishes to represent continuity with the years past in Pécs.
It was a line from the old group of Balázs Zsäer.
We are well with the reference to flight but on the side of air music now appears, following the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, the impact of rock and roll.
György Lageti, a singer currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the first album in the Millennium Park.
On the album, there is a real tube for the radio, Mr.2 Petõfi, which has been spreading from the popular music of the morning to the evening, began to introduce the songs of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian songs (underground Divas).
It's all right, then. (?)
hvg.hu is the position of questions by Balázs Zzzeger.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: Is your music well preserved for a certain layer?
Zzzeer Balázs: The music term for a certain cup doesn't tell me much.
For me there are two castles in the light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sound music.
Music is said to be alternative, underground can also be medicine and made only for sale and thus become commercial.
But a good pop song can be sincere too.
The attitude of reception in this spirit also works regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign public, is it that one or the other is more open to your music?
Zs.B.: In the outside, especially in the west the light music has more ancient traditions.
There, people go to concerts and not only young people of a decade or twenty years of age but also older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I am obviously happy to see people come more and more to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
For us music is not done to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important to concerts or the mutual influence already works, but it is understood only in the inexhaustible changes of the moment.
But I noticed that if you wanted to respond to public expectations, you wouldn't be interested anymore.
hvg.hu: Do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He worked alone and did a career in the West rather than in the West.
Zs.B.: We do not really follow his path even if some sometimes try to find traces in our music.
Instead, we are team players who trust the other's musical presence and the kids are spreading.
At first, it was quite inevitable that our music would be compared to that of Yonderboi because we are too many to leave his group and take another path.
hvg.hu: On the palm tree of Mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Love takes the first place.
Many are those who heard the name Zagar for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style you have deliberately opened to a larger layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't plan to make a tube to sell the disc.
This song means more.
We wanted it at the end of the album to try to detect the most difficult sounds and themes addressed throughout the disk.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six songs?
Why - What was the line?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a Choral of the type of gospel.
We had the idea of composed this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
The choir was composed of six members, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judy Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Nemeth, who was then baptized Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like this or did the girls change it a bit?
Zs.B.: This piece had existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought there was something else in this song.
The follow-up to the agreement drew the voice of the song.
I sang the same song the night the girls learned later.
I had it almost immediately and everything was awfully spontaneous.
I remember it galvanized me at the time, but of course we needed Divas.
With my voice, she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the disc and at the concert it also seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no one alone (except only one short of Judy Jay), they don't have a single role, they sing all together and they don't sing more than music, so music does not just accompany their song.
They were back on the scene, too.
Is that what you want?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is only technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary is that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says that we must forget a little of our ego, forget who comes from, who goes, or, just let these wings, the wings of love, carry us.
I wanted others also to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which songs have made you the most work?
Zs.B.: In fact, nothing about the music creation process has been more difficult for us in the mix.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I'm playing a concert piano, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work long, and then, little by little, everything was set up like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: This changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I've already "remove" this disc.
At this point, it is Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trader is at risk of billions due to its inferiority complex
A dissimulating fraud.
This is how his ex-employer describes the general company, owner of the Czech Bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost almost five billion euros for him.
But it seems that Kerviel is just a big player who wanted to equal his colleagues, and who, in addition, can never be considered incapable.
Unlike all large bank houses, he recognized in time the crisis in the US mortgage market.
"He's fragile," they let his superiors hear him call him the police.
However, if Kerviel's deposition is taken into account by the French media, including Le Monde, the transactions of this man have produced a profit of EUR 1.6 billion at the end of last year.
The crisis goes beyond the United States
"All I wanted was to earn money for my bank," he said in the deposit.
The last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to win half a billion euros.
In fact, he heard the occasion from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February, according to which “sub-primary” assumptions given to low-income customers or to those who had met in the past with reimbursement difficulties would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he did well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its benefits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
"Since I won my first half billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel trusts and adds that he has, of course, nothing kept for himself."
In all the questionnaires, the report has been incorrect in order not to be ignored.
He has succeeded in duplicating his superiors, although the Eurex race has begun to take an interest in his transactions.
Who's risking nothing
Was he afraid to find out?
Not at all.
"I thought the simple fact that I had got 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where's his willingness to risk so much?
He arrived at his post only gradually.
He had started working with the General Society in 2000 just after completing his studies at Lyon University.
His annual salary was about $111,000.
Two years later, he was already a trade assistant and, in 2005, he became independent with an annual salary of $90 billion.
However, he knew he would never win as much as the others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I knew I was much less considered than the others.
In view of my university course and my professional and personal course," Kerviel told researchers.
But soon after his entry into office, he won his first big success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won a half-billion euros on the decline in this title in London's attacks.
And the mechanism was started - he wanted more.
As long as you get, we leave you alone
"There was a bulge of snow," he said to the police.
But the superiors were at the root of everything, or rather, they doubted.
"As long as I won, they seemed to close their eyes."
But that's when it comes to the beginning of the year.
He loses a billion euros a day.
In mid-January, after weekend, he decided to hide the sum.
Monday, when he comes to work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost EUR 5 billion because of him.
And how did we find out?
He became suspicious of his absence.
"Last year, I took only four days of rest.
A trader who doesn't take vacations is a trader who doesn't want to leave his book to another," Kerviel concludes.
The Czech Republic on the occasion of reaching 365 billion
Yesterday, the Ministers of the Czech Government signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring EUR 14 billion (about 365 billion) to the Czech Republic.
This is almost half the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007-2013.
Nearly 125 billion core outputs of seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain some 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
The transport sector will benefit most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial means available to the Czech Republic in the context of these projects.
This money will be the source of an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a total of 90.8 billion dollars next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme, intended for SMEs and entrepreneurs, must provide financial means to encourage innovation within the enterprise.
Enterprises should obtain financial means for introducing new technologies, research in industry, but also for introducing new more efficient management methods.
To date, the Czech Republic has been among the new members of the EU's most successful beneficiaries.
The Tribunal confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for the former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal confirmed yesterday the 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for a fraud of $100 million (about 1.8 billion dollars).
But later he was released and was assigned to reside in his garden near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former head of this Central American state, in force between 1997 and 2002, will be or will not be again in custody at the moment, according to the AP agency, it will not be clear.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez will now depend on prison officers, or they will either let Germany end his sentence, or be angry again in prison.
Four years ago, the Court confirmed that Germany regularly transferred the government's money to foreign companies' accounts in Panama.
It was business companies and accounts were actually owned by members of his family and his closest partners.
A part of this money was invested in the funds that Germany had created to finance its electoral campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted
That's right.
The statistical budget was adopted.
What is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget made by this Government and accepted by the majority without the support of the opposition.
This year has passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech socialist party - ČSSD, because it is Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford to refuse it.
Contrary to the debate before the vote on the Government ' s statement of defence, this time there is nothing dramatic.
The House of Members has adopted no problem with this law, which, although most influential, is normally not.
There's a kind of paradox.
Whether we want it or not, each chapter and each article is the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is part of the policy, which is hidden behind the competition for power against government and opposition.
This latter is more media-active and is therefore more attention given to media.
Political men's disputes are much more interesting than broken figures.
The national budgets of the previous socialist governments suffered three worse than the current budget could not be fixed at the same time:
The first is the important part of the duties imposed by the law, consisting not only of deductions, but also social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" grouping the parties to the ČSSD and KSCHM.
The second is a weak economy, as a consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the lack of public finances, i.e. the lack of cities and communities.
However, this is not the deficit of the state budget, which is the biggest exception.
This is public and relatively controlled.
The real bomb will soon be the shortage of cities and communities.
Many mayors often issued obligations, which, in turn, depreciated their municipalities, in order to obtain money from taxes, tax duties and bank loans, from new sources of investment.
In the past years, they have been able to repay these debts by mass sales of distribution systems, including energy from the State as part of privatisations.
Today, they have no more of this source.
If we only take into account official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy has been through for many years, like the rest of the world, a phase of growth and ČSSD is not lacking to wait.
This was a unique opportunity for successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
Instead, they claimed the State more and more.
Other countries, with some exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a far more reasonable way than our Republic.
It is a monster honour that is largely on the previous governments.
We are part of countries which are, at a global level, the least threatened by poverty.
We therefore do not need massive social programmes that are, just in recent years, unfortunately unusually affected.
Although it has succeeded in eliminating some of the absurd populace expenditure, approved last year before the elections, if a decline in the age limit for retirement, and a reform of the pension system will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in this country and whoever will be in power, it will not be managed.
In extreme punishment, it can be said that political men in power will become bureaucrats who mechanically distribute the majority of the money imposed between retirements and social benefits.
That is why the current budget can't be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that makes ordinary costs rest at the costs of mandates.
The deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely useless if the previous Governments had not spent all the money they could.
If we really do not want that policies in power become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the State can only spend the equivalent of what it has to do with tax and tax rights, the peace necessary to prepare new reform laws.
There is only one of those who will gradually achieve a balanced statistical budget.

Banks want to settle the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the English, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to combat the financial market crisis together.
More than $100 billion will be placed on monetary markets through deposits.
It will be for banks to sell, through a system of deposits, interest rates for which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the United States Federation will send $40 billion in cash and will also provide 24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the Central Banks of individual States have decided to take action to prevent the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to solve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," writes Bernard Baumohl in his report to customers of the Economic Outlook Group.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 per cent to about 50 per cent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to outstanding loans, especially in the United States.
The analysts are still waiting for billions of other losses.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this approach, it is that they must really understand what can still be done," said economist AbN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central Banks fear that, if banks themselves will have difficulty access to loans, they will lend more money to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and put the US economy in a recession that could affect global economic growth.
The Central Banks made this choice after it failed to lower the interbank rate in London, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were always afraid of mutual loans, even though the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and England had reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a new downturn of interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting company.
Some analysts do not believe that the approach of the Central Banks will not contribute to the crisis, as it does not address the main problem that is the fall in the US real estate market.
President Klaus: The discussions of ecologists are incredible
Global climate change has been felt black especially in developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke about the problem of planetary warming.
This time, the criticism came to light at the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not white, he stated that the discussions of ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, this is not only the structure of the conference, made up of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the fundamental difference between the rétoire and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it is just a set of words, highlighting solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
When presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that his subject was of great importance to him and that is why he was so committed.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appeared in German translation, because he said, "I often find that the characterization of my opinions."
Now, interested people can read their positions without being disappointed.
Klaus reminded himself that although he was not a climateist, he still had enough provisions to make such a book.
In fact, it is an academic able to follow and appreciate scientific treaties, it has the practice of statistics and it is also economicist.
The major conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following themes: the climate is constantly changing, its changes are normal, therefore there is no opinion shared by all researchers on planetary warming, the effects of the current changes are neither too important nor too serious, so they are not too dangerous and, finally, efforts to influence climate change are useless, ineffective and unacceptable.
As far as the experience of a comprehensive regime is concerned, it is not acceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which makes it a dangerous threat to freedom.
In response to the people's questions, he explained several times that he was not against "a reasonable protection of the environment, but against an integrated environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the benefits they bring".
In Vienna, Klaus had already discussed this matter two months ago at Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people have failed to renew their driving permits in time
Six hundred thousand drivers left the deadline and failed to renew their old driving licence, whose validity reached at the end of the year.
We are the last day where people can still ask for the renewal, so that the authorities are able to grant them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Ministry was not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers would borrow the road without valid permission.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their permit to drive, especially those who no longer wish to drive.
While municipalities report a decrease in the number of requests for renewal of the permit, the authorities in the capital are subject to applications and the number of applications for renewal of the permit has increased this week.
Marie met about 2000 customers per day.
There's a hole in half an hour close.
In Prague, nearly 140.OOO drivers have not renewed their driving permits yet.
The delivery of a new permit takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request delivery within a short period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays a supplement of five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who will not be able to carry out the mandatory renewal of the driving permit by the end of the year and will acquire the road without a valid permit will be at risk from January onwards.
The debtor will be obliged to pay at least two thousand crowns.
However, the police can also deal with the crime by using a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the amendment amounts to 2,500 crowns.
According to previous information, it was likely that even a person who did not have to move was able to move.
She could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Department had called upon the authorities to moderate and impose no more than 1000 fines.
However, according to the Department of Transport's spokesman Karel Hanselka, no one is at risk of tens of thousands of amendments.
The driving permit is, according to him, a document which people can decide whether they wish to have it or not.
This is not like the identity card which, she must be valid without exceptions.
People who no longer want to drive should grant their driving permits.
It is sufficient to bring it or send it to the respective municipality.
The driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also obliged to gradually renew other types of driving permits.
Persons with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 shall be expressed in December 2013.
According to Hanselka, it is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Court reduced the penalties for the detectives agreed with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Konıřík, former police officers accused of conniving with the gang of David Berdych, will be sentenced to thirty and ten years in prison respectively.
The Supreme Court of Prague therefore condemned them by reducing their penalties for 1 and 2 years respectively.
In the beginning, the Department's detectives for the fight against organized crime were sentenced to 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's judgment, only one appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused of this case, he is only waiting for the verdict of the first instance.
However, he has already received other sentences of more than 16 years in prison.
He can't get more.
In January, the Departmental Tribunal recognized that there were 19 persons involved, and today the Supreme Court dealt with the appeals of 16 of them.
Since the beginning of the investigation, the majority of the defendants have questioned the charges by claiming that they were handling a case.
According to the Central Bohem Court, police members, after an agreement with Berdych, transmitted information from police sources to the offenders, covered the various arrests and helped the gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang placed 30 percent of the larcin in Opava and Konıřík.
In the case, there is a question of the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999-2001.
Much of the military flights in which the victims have, in most cases, been seriously affected by health, but also the abuse of power by a public agent and the prohibited armament.
In domestic investigations, the police have, in fact, discovered illegal pistols, knives with a steel knife, a viewer for direct laser shots or a missile.
According to the allegations, the gang has grown to tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from about a dozen people in this trial, the courts have already recognized other flights to Berdych and a number of others.
Other men in the area of Berdych are still explaining themselves to the court in another trial, some cases have not yet been brought to court.
The main audience has, for the moment, avoided Tomáš Póta and Maroš Šulej who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they await the final decision on their extradition in the Czech Republic.
The Price of the Replacement of Children: 12 million
Igor Veleba's family lawyer wants to get from Třebic's hospital a downgrading of 12 million more crowns.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That's why the lawyer at the Ondréj Dostal hospital is not absolutely in agreement with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, it is very high," Dostal said at the end of the hearing.
"To have an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report of which the opposite party has ordered the drafting.
We're going to check if he's at some interpretative value.
But we continue to believe that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostal stressed.
The amount should, according to him, be fixed between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family of Jablonov asked for a million crowns every month where she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, prepared for him by the University Hospital Centre in Prague-Motol, as a document to support the negotiations on demolition.
According to psychologists and psychiatrists, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different levels and depth.
The situation of stress was better supported by men, although they were faced with reservations that did not prevent the replacement of new generations.
Women, who remain less serene before the life of traumatism in the present and what is happening precisely at this time, have summarized the contents of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the hospital of Tříbič on 9 December last.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola in the Čermák in Príbiyslavice and Veronika in Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jablonov.
The governor of the region Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil surrendered to each 100,000 Crown families for reimbursement of the expenses incurred by the error of the Třebč hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in Czech Republic are bound by the Civil Responsibility Insurance Act.
In the event of a shortage, they must be able to land in the reserve fund, except for which they can request assistance from the manager.
So far, the courts recognized relatively low damages, and the amounts calculated according to the tables amounted to hundreds of thousands, except millions.
Polívka and the loss of the Kingdom of Valaisko (with Kingdom of Valaisko)
Bolek Polívka lost his debts on the subject of the sign of the Kingdom of Valášské (Royaume de Valáško).
According to the District Court judge of Ostrava, he was actually using the title King of Valaško for the first time, but the project was founded by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, the former actor's partner.
Polivka was not present at today's hearing.
But, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will call.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are on Bolek Polivka's popularity," Polivka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words of the Kingdom of Valaško just appeal to this actor and comics around the world.
Harabish is of the same opinion.
"We've been working for almost ten years.
He said he was looking for money and setting it up for events."
According to him, it's the money that is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They want to stop our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, Polivka was the first to use the title Valášský král (Roi de Valáško) in his television broadcast.
Actor Radoslav Brzoboheatý had ruled her king in 1993.
At the time, however, this had nothing to do with the project of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Haribish came with the idea of representing passports from Valášské Kálovství.
From a humorous action to the beginning it is a lucrative business and commercial activity, followed by creation, by Haribish, of the company Valašké kärlovství.
In 1997 Polivka agreed that her name and signature should be mentioned in the passport and even proposed payment holders on the price of the visit to her farm and theatre.
Who's gonna sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš has made use of the new idea, published by Polivka in the management issue, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polivka has certainly helped the Valášké kingdom project," the judge said.
She added, however, that the project's soul was made up of Haribish and his team devoted to the project in an intensive manner.
The collaboration between the opposing parties today continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized an official tour in Vsetín for Polivka.
But since then, conflicts have begun to accumulate between Polivka and Haribish, who have culminated in the deposition of "King Boleslav's 1st election forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Haribish, taken by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as the mother of Queen.
Then, in 2002, Polivka filed a complaint against Harabish and his company, asking that the court had refused today.
What could make the case clear, is the tournament for the throne and a half of the princess.
He should be coming out of a new king.
He didn't want the details and the date.
"We don't want to go fast in need.
it would be something like the King's defense in Slovakia.
The king would have been elected for a while.
Even Mr. Polivka can clearly sign up," Haribish added.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: disappearance of prejudices
In fact, I've never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its quality of rolling was nothing extraordinary, the quality of speed change, conduct and also that of manufacturing could, in some respects, be less than average.
However, currently there is on the market its successor, Peugeot 207, which is much better.
The more the so-called SW Combi goes a step further, the more I think about it.
When I was testing the classic hackback of the Peugeot 207, I complained for example of the space for the head on the back seats.
As long as you're done with the complaints because Combi's carriage means that even the big devils will be, in this regard, easy.
Let's see soon.
I'm going to call the inside very quickly so I don't say too much.
It's a little bit of a successful design, but it's just about the central tunnel that makes me look poor.
There, I'd like a little more inventive design, given that the car is so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when you can complain about sittings or too short files is a revolution.
The lateral guide has also improved significantly compared to model 206.
As far as space is concerned, the increase in the dimensions of the rail is also sensitive.
The Combi also sees the lack of space above the head mentioned above.
A buffer in the buffer
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage support.
I have to evaluate it as very readily accessible (also thanks to the pivoting ice behind) and a rather easy reach.
The blind spaces are filled with elastics of arrest which constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not conciliatory and can be extended as long as it is capable of having sufficiently heavy objects.
But let's stop at the volume.
According to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, this is a rather average number in relation to competition.
Apart from Škoda Fabia Combi, this category is the most sold vehicle in Czech Republic.
If we compare 207 SW to the new generation of the product of Mlada Boleslav, we find that Peugeot remains very sensitive behind, the difference is 52 litres.
When it comes to leaving abroad to leave, or rather to carry a push, this figure is almost critical.
However, if I had to reap the benefits, I would mention the bottom of the box after the rollover of the back seat files perfectly legally, or a very low margin.
120 horse-repared on four cylinders
The vehicle we tested was equipped with an Otto four cylinder engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And in fact, that's what should be like a 1.6 that makes a family hackback.
It's quiet, consume little and, above all, it's good.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Škoda that often gives the impression of having a pot of escape wrapped by a mirror, then I can only be enthusiastic.
Rates Perforated
The price of the vehicle is not accessible by all.
However, we need to be aware that we have tested a very well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4 litre engine up to 329 900 Kč is still legible.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is already sufficient.
The Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80,000 Kč.
But we have more airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic glazing, automatic command of the back windows...
In fact, the vehicle costs up to the account 531 900 Kč.
It's a lot, but try to add additional equipment to Fabia's price and you'll get a very similar number.
So he's more than just choosing the brand.
The integration of Slovak students into British schools is a tragedy
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is growing, causing remaining concerns about the evolution of local education.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans into a series of obstacles is currently under way.
British schools even note cases where conflicts between immigrants and indigenous peoples become violent.
The case of Kent of the North, where the ongoing opposition and immigrants of Slovak origin began to intensify, well illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The disputes, the chician and the bagars between the students were transferred to the relationship between the parents.
The situation is so far away that the police stopped in Chatham a Slovak woman who was hit by a bar to make a ten-year-old student.
The prisoner defends himself by claiming that the boy has been insulted by racist issues.
The police also had to take action following the attack against a Slovak immigrants led by two teenagers.
The young girls had reportedly addressed this man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we got home, a young man jumped on the bus stop and started to jump us up.
When I told him to stop, he answered by pomps and pears and then discovered his legs," a mother of Slovak students described another unpleasant adventure.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the survivors has gone to qualify for conflict with immigrants to fight for survival.
The above-mentioned cases show that the atmosphere in British schools between indigenous and immigrant populations begins to tend.
70 thousand Slovaks came to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And about 30 thousand Slovak students frequent British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful Caribbean island
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your spouses can be achieved if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches such as snow, high valleys, or a calm sea like a stick.
Palms and everything included with servers that offer you on the beach a pizza, ice cream or fresh cocktails.
The kitesurfing, the golf course and the roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you will not only find this list in its integrity, but richness.
But there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilleans.
In the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the base of their invasion of America.
Christophe Colomb qualified him as the best place the human eye has ever seen.
Havane became the warehouse and place of transit of treasures that the Spanish had flown and transported to Europe.
Then came the American age.
The National Hotel was built at the beginning of the 20th year.
That's Lucky Luciano, one of the heads of the American mafia, who built it, because everything that was a crime in the United States (especially under the ban) was approved and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients, there was, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-level buildings also moved cars, which belonged to the cult symbols of the last 50's, were on the broad bullevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near the Havane, and, in Cojímar, he had his yacht.
The stars of the business show and the political men of America as a whole left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguiita del Medio.
So, what about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguiita de la Havane.
In the bar of the National hotel, a luxury hotel, you will mix the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars are still traveling to Havana, because the jigolis and the imported gadgets have long since, in a climate where salt and humidity can be eaten.
Although the Havane, especially the oldest part, is quite depreciated, there are no other parts in the surrounding areas that are so beautiful colonial monuments that it has exactly below.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
As tourism brings money if necessary, its development is green fire.
During the last 15 years, new hotels have moved not only to Havana, but especially to Varader, on the coast of the province of Holguín, as well as on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique to the world and which will be appreciated especially by the amateurs of small trains.
The canne was returned from the plants extended into the sugars on a narrow road by small steam and engine trains.
Their rolling material has not been renewed for decades, and it can also be seen in the course of small locomatives where contemporarys are no longer only in museums.
Where's he headed?
Most visitors do not miss the most famous places.
So there is no need to write it long on Varadero or well on Havana.
Not to mention that in Hemingway's property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that whoever loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The valley of Vináles in the west of the island is one of Cuba's most picturesque corners.
An excavating vegetation lies on a halve.
Mogots, calculus, and rocks are raised in trade from the bottom of the valley, and, from the fertile land being taken in their nests, even its rocks can be covered by a very dense vegetable carpet.
The valley is the place where the Cuban tobacco is probably cultivated of the best quality.
You will be able to find the final form of this product if you visit one of the tobacco factories in Havana.
Someone may also find it interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was turned.
Trinidad
Ancient town was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It is the trade of slaves and sugar that brought him glory and wealth.
The wealth is rooted in the beauty and character of this city of reduced size.
The colonial Spanish architecture, highly influenced by later French commentators, has not changed in almost four centuries.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the mountain mass Escambray, is such a place as in the last 50's, there was no road that would link this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay away.
There was nothing built, and that's why we didn't do anything else, everyone was happy to have a roof above his head.
If there is more time than one afternoon in Trinidad, then it is worth seeing interesting places around, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the Sucreries Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música, who is breathing after the sun's fall and where the music is only in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this bourgade located in the eastern part of Cuba as the most beautiful island.
This opinion is, of course, already influenced by the way it goes.
The two roads that have taken place since Guantánamo have to cross high and dangerous mountains and cross almost unmarked areas of human activity.
UNESCO has registered the Eastern Republic of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the list of world heritage.
There is the best chocolate there, in the church, there is the cross of Christophe Colomb (in fact, she has seen the day nearly a hundred years after the Pearl of Columbus) and since the Colline where the old chateau-fort and the current El Castillo hotel are held, there are several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
With regard to coffee, rhum, cigarettes, the Sierra Maestro mountain mass, the Bay of Tyres and the Isle of Pinos, the Tropicalan Cabaret, the Holy Father of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of ancient slaves, a number of pages could be filled.
However, as it is rightly said, it needs to be seen once.
In Afghanistan, alliances are passive, claims Americans
The lack of troops and equipment required affects, according to the United States, the performance of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to defence minister Robert Gates, NATO should fly a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not as it should be, the representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country were agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing challenge of the Taliban movement, the eight States involved today are also discussing future plans and the coordination of alliances.
While the United States has called this week through the Minister of Defence Robert Gates NATO troops into greater activity, Great Britain sees the strengthening of the Afghan Government's authority and the intensifying of development assistance.
"The evolution in Afghanistan is perceived, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to enable residents to start a new economic and security development themselves," said the British Defence Minister Des Browne to the BBC chain.
Twenty-eight per cent
The activity of Afghans is, according to the U.S. Army data, the most intense activity in the last five years.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 per cent over the past year, up to 60 per cent in Helmand Province, located in the south of the country.
NATO countries have some 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, including almost one quarter in the southern part.
However, according to the United States, alliances have reached their absolute limits and in the organization and equipment of the troops.
In particular, they require other helicopters, soldiers and experts for training Afghan troops.
"We must seriously reflect on the specific objectives for the future period, as well as on how to achieve them," Gates said.
The NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop has made similar comments today.
"I am not happy about what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have almost twenty-four percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's not enough," said De Hope to the Reuters agency at the end of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo for three days.
Who's Passive
In recent months, conflict-related countries have also ruled as to whether all alliances are effectively doing their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized for its psychiatry.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, the fighting requirements they are subject to are not as strict as those in the South and East parts of the country where we operate," Gates said.
The British Sun tabloid qualified this week for German parasex soldiers.
"The Afghan fans discovered: the Germans play, while we fight," wrote Sun in a document filled with photos of German soldiers playing at the table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild was attacked by publishing the photo of a British team during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
The debt of the State will rise to a billion in 2009
The debt of a State over 84,000 Crowns is charged to each Czech State.
The total debt is raised at the end of September at 842.7 billion dollars.
The Government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion dollars this year.
As a result of a change in state budget savings, the Department has reduced the projected amount of 152.8 billion dollars.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic was raised by the end of September at 842.7 billion dollars.
During the nine months of this year, he has therefore increased to 40.2 billion crowns.
But since June, it has decreased to 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has thus confirmed its data on State debt since the beginning of October.
The charge of a debt exceeding 84,000 crowns per Czech.
Over the last year, the State has spent more than 111 billion crowns.
"For the moment, it seems that, due to a less important deficit for the next year, there could be more than a billion crowns border in 2009 alone.
The next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and a billion dollars," said the analyst of Patria Finance David Marek for the iHNed.cz server.
The forecast of Next Finance analyst Vladimir Pikor is similar: "There could be more than one billion in 2009.
The specific date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If the situation on the political scene seemed to change, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed in 2010.
But I do not expect this change," he explained.

The debt of the State is made up of central government debt and is mainly generated by the accumulation of State budget deficits.
The debt of the State is financed by the assets of the treasurer, income securities, direct loans or, for example, loans to the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal income increased this year by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion dollars.
The external debt of the State increased this year by 1.7 billion Crowns to 123.3 billion Crowns.
The debt of the so-called negotiated State reached the end of September 803.3 billion dollars, and since June it has decreased from 13.7 billion dollars.
The average debt exifiability of the State rose to 6.5 years.
"The total debt has increased annually from the first to the third half of 13 percent, which is, given the current good health of the economy, a very high figure.
It is interesting that the increase is mainly generated by interest rates where it reaches 20 percent.
It is bad that debt grows, but on the other hand, it indicates that it will have to negotiate when retirement reform comes," Piko said.
Better than expected.
It is based on the State debt financing and management strategy for 2007 that the Government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion dollars this year.
However, at the beginning of September, thanks to a change in state budget savings, the Department has reduced the estimated amount of 152.8 billion dollars.
The sum is essentially the deficit of the State's budget, which will in all likelihood reach 76 billion dollars this year, instead of 91.3 billion initially planned.
It is then the maximum resources provided for by the Czech Consolidation Agency, namely 13.3 billion euros, the 10 billion reserve for pension payments, the financing of state pension entitlements for 43 billion euros, and the reimbursement of the European Investment Bank's loans amounting to 1.8 billion euros.
She was compared today to a court in Khartoum to have appointed an hour in prison.
The British teacher who was convicted in Sudan for insult to Islam was sentenced on Thursday night by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and to expulsion, said his lawyer.
Britain was accused of leaving students from 6 to 7 years of age to give the name of Mahomet in a funeral while any representation of the Prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was fit for a beating of foot.
This 54-year-old British institution in office at Khartoum University in the Sudan was arrested on Sunday and charged with assault on Islam and seduction under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from students' parents to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story goes back in September, when this teacher asks his students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the class's holiday season.
“Today names come from the children’s mouth, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says the school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as the preferred prime name.
Mohamed is certainly the name of the Muslim prophet, but especially a very common name in Sudan.
The children then produced a book for the class with the photo of ours following the legend "My name is Mohamed".
He himself had no label with that name, but the problem was simply that of the representative of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who taught in the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew her well and that she would never do anything that could be offensive to a religious faith, "I regret it just because she asked the children to vote for a name," he said only of "an innocent mistake".
Opinion shared by many students of the institution who describe it as “very attentive to its students” and “who never talks about religion in class”.
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Great Britain, it is written in 14 different English.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way to honor the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we give it to a game, for example?
Of course, this is an interpretation question.
They did not reach agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiating session in Vienna.
Finally, the failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians ended Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last session of discussions without having been able to overcome their differences about the future status of the separatist province.
"It is sad that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the status," said European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was “in the game”, his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not expect violence at the moment, but we enter a very difficult period," he added, and it is relevant that "open tensions exist".
End of the mediation on 10 December
The Troika media, which group the European Union, the United States and Russia, will return to Serbia and Kosovo once a month.
The future of the province of 90 per cent of Albanophones could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediaman Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will submit their report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last round of negotiations since the Troika was charged with a new United Nations mediation last August.
Americans and Europeans considered their mediation to be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the Security Council from granting independence in Kosovo, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that date.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of onusian administration in Kosovo, the West feels that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina is ready to proclaim unilaterally if the Security Council does not intervene in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increasing autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," announced the President of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the Baden hotel where these "negotiations of the last chance" have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebels and the future Prime Minister of the province, regrets his regret.
However, he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade “was part of a past that led to murders and deportations”.
‘Effect domain’
Serbian President Boris Tadic felt that a compromise was always visible, maintaining the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of the province's independence.
In particular, Belgrade said to reduce a "domino effect" in a region still fragile by the wars of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
Mardi, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should be returned exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian alliance had a veto right.
"The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word"
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end up as they began: to the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of the Albanians would be "contested" with the West.
Bush draws an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced at the opening of the International Peace Conference on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas were willing to undertake negotiations immediately in order to find a definitive resolution of the 60-year-old happy one among their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do all he could to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must deplore "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, reminding both parties of their obligations under the "roadmap" for the peace they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, chaired by Abbas, would aim “to conclude a peace treaty that resolves all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues”.
This call covers the three major problems in the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian people: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees displaced from their homes in what is today the State of Israel in the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American President, Abbas stressed that future negotiations would be "globally and deeply" and all aspects of a regulation, including "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
On his tour to the court, Olmert committed himself to the future talks to be "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to blow them up in the run of 2008.
By the end of 2008, Bush set the deadline for the implementation of its Palestinian and Israeli "visual vision of two States".
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made a commitment in this sense to Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, which has been endorsed by all Arab countries, which offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a career in the history of the Middle East, especially because it affects the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", says Prince Saoud in his interview with Saudi capitals on the Arab daily.
The police are not responsible for the prosecution.
What exactly happened, Sunday?
As every time in this type of fact, official versions and Romanians are against each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the National Police Inspectorate's Survey (IGN) survey, a police car circled Sunday, less than 17 hours later, on Louise-Michel Street, in Villaers-le-Bel.
"It was not in intervention but in patrol, and circled 40-50 km/h, without gyrophare," explains a police source.
A green bike from the Kawazaki brand, "not approved, so not allowed to travel on the public road" (read below) and piloted by two young people without helmets, was "to a very live allure".
“She touched the police car on her left after a right-priority refusal,” said one policeman.
The control of alcohol on vehicle operators has been shown to be negative.
The state of the car (before deflated, tedious father-in-law, shackled father-chocks) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèrere de Givry, announced that he had committed an investigation for "involutive homicide and non-assistance to a person at risk" to the IGPN, in conjunction with the Departmental Directorate of Public Security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation of the IGPN at this stage had removed the responsibility of the police.
According to the judge, three witnesses of the accident, heard on Sunday evening, confirmed "the police version, namely that this mini-moto has arrived relatively quickly on their left".
Yesterday, a sort of rain, doubtless caused by the freezing of roads on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained in hiding when the police car arrived to freeze.
Vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsies yesterday.
What happened just after?
Yesterday, a roommate moved fast in Villaers-le-Bel, which said the police would have gone very fast away from the places, not getting help for the two young people.
The IGPN, however cautious, would also eliminate "all serious errors" concerning this point.
"It is one aspect of the most difficult investigation, which requires more research, which must be very careful," said a police source.
Freedom met with an eye witness from these few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows giving exactly on the scene.
“We are all now down, with my cousin who is infirm at the hospital, to try to rape them, tells this witness.
There was nothing to do."
He then saw "a police officer fully watched, who was beating.
Two others were trying to re-enact one of the young, and the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension surrounding the scene, and it seems to be true that the young people were present in the unexpected situation, the police were driven into the car by colleagues who arrived at the places.
According to this witness, the relief took place “about twenty minutes after the departure of the police”.
They also practiced cardiac massages, in vain.
"I won't let you say that police services have not helped young people.
These young people were rescued.
The pumpers arrived all the time.
Everything was done to try to save them," the prosecutor stressed.
The tension mounts in Pakistan
The Pakistani police repressed the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protested against the measures taken in the state of emergency were injured by the lacrymogenes used by the order forces, according to witnesses.
The latter have been repatriated by stone jets, harming the police.
At least 350 lawyers were interviewed.
Similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers, were charged and injured by lawyers.
Many would have been interviewed.
In Islamabad, lawyers from the Supreme Court Barrier called for a general strike and announced demonstrations following a wave of some 500 arrests during the week of opposition, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the assembly.
Other demonstrations would be held in Multitan (center) and Peshawar (north-west).
The movement of lawyers received support from religious parties grouped in the strong Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president urged the people to send flowers to the judges who had spoken against the state of emergency and the destruction of those who had made their prayers before Musharraf'.
''The promise of Musharraf has no more''
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly targeted by the measure of exception announced on Saturday evening.
It should be held in the next few days on the legality of the re-election to the President, on 6 October, to the indirect blow of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was elected and replaced.
''All of this to which our assistants are illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court',' said the Magistrate in The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army head and become a civil president 'no more' after the establishment of the state of emergency, said Monday the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
He left his military uniform waiting until 15 November, at the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that January elections could be reported.
In addition, the Pakistani Government has decomposed in the country under which President Musharraf would have been assigned to reside by his Deputy Chief of Arms.
More than one third of the large cases remain unexpected
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancy (24%) as well as unplanned or unplanned births.
Today, more than one in three (36%) is not planned, a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined) shows that forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth Act, which has liberalised the contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancy (24%) as well as unplanned or unplanned births.
The different methods of contraception, such as pill or sterile, still present a rate of failure of 5% to 6%, is estimated by India.
The liberalisation of contraception has also allowed a better "master of fecundity", according to the institution which notes that the rate of use of the pill in women between 20 and 44 years has passed from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births of ten would be well planned today.

Spectacular repair on the space station
It will take more than seven hours to work in space at Scott Parazynski and his international Space Station (ISS) teammates to perform the spectacular repair of a solar panel, which is essential for the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risk output that accumulated the memories of its duration, its distance from the living modules, the speed with which it was imagined, the "brickled" tools by the astronomers to perform the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when astronomers had decomposed the Discovery module, a large cylindrical room that would soon welcome European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see frame).
This module is a kind of set-up for laboratory modules.
But you need to be able to provide them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move an electricity production module with 17.5 tons of solar panels, already present on the ISS, in order to put it on its final position.
After moving, the crew started the redisplacement of the solar panels of the module with a depth of 76 metres.
And that's where one of the panels, which spread like gifts, was damaged about a meter by a cable that started.
Deployment has been stopped so as not to cause further damage to the panel.
The astronomers, who were originally supposed to perform a control exit of the Discovery vessel, then to repair another solar panel that was defective by the rotation system, were forced to use the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who was chosen to carve over 30 meters long of the ordered arm of the ship added to the station to perform repair.
It's one of the best spacewalker in Nasa.
Large, resistant, very fair, it has the very developed torso and long arms.
Thus, at 46 years of age, this trained doctor was responsible for "operating" the solar panel "damaged".
After careful inspection of the damages, he cut the false cable and installed types of "athlages" on the damaged area.
He was helped by a second spacewalker staying near the sand and, inside, by other astronauts, Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, an insulated hockey channel to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "brickled" by the astronomers on the station's side.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski expected the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of his tools and restoring the inside of the station.
After noon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day of detention before today, seven astronomers did not return the Discovery vessel for a return on Wednesday.
The title of EADS fined in Bourse
The EADS action is currently under way at the Paris Round, after the Aeronautics and Defence Group announced that it would have to spend between EUR 1,2 and EUR 1.4 billion to face the A400M delays.
EADS will lose 4% to 21.96 euros at the Paris Forum.
The group was required to review its operational performance forecast for 2007 following the delays generated by the slow development of the A400M engine, which provides for the inaugural flight of the aircraft.
The cost of the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is estimated to be between EUR 1,2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus, has announced the home of the European manufacturer EADS.
As a result of these burdens, EADS will be obliged to announce new performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 when submitting its next Thursday quarterly results, adding it without any more figures.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the delay of six months.
In order to remember, the operational result of EADS fell by 86 per cent in 2006, mainly due to delays in another programme, the one of the very large porter A380.
Initially, the Group planned a first delivery of A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The selection of the status bar
There will be no delay on Sunday at the end of the sessions: the Russians will make a massive choice for the party of President Putin, Russia.
Confirming their desire for stability, or for authoritarianism, after a very complicated campaign.
On three days of legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today addressed the voters a message on public channels, already registered but the content is kept secret.
It is made up of Russia's Union list head, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is declared shocking.
Yesterday, the president left nothing to be seen by receiving foreign embassies, happy to deliver a new burden on the accused West - his theme of preaching during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we want honest, transparent and open elections, free elections," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from the account.
She calls for an intensified campaign of pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Zioganov says that there has never been "no fair elections, even in the time of Elstine".
After the repression of the last week's demonstrations, the former champion of the world of chess, Gary Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, remains forbidden to visit according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have kept the mind of the Soviets"
Following these without delay, two more open issues are being identified:
- Who's going to be in Putin's office?
The Official Journal published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidency, on 2 March 2008; the candidates reached 23 December to make themselves known.
He was elected in 2000 and completed in 2004, Vladimir Putin could not fulfil a third consecutive mandate.
But no successor will arise.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the most powerful Russian party who would choose the Government and the President?
Whatever it is, to the legislators like the presidential authority, the power of triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mind of the Soviets, they do not feel masters of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov, of the State University of St. Petersburg, says that civil society has been delayed in this Christian country five centuries after Europe; the famous Community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine re-examined with the model of a patriarchal state, fully accepted by the population as much as this new patriarchalism was not followed by terror, but by some economic austerity," says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians are “renouncing their personal responsibility” which they had briefly demonstrated after the URSS was released.
"And what good thing is it to think about?"
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 heads of Russian regions) direct the local lists of Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonyms of chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name of which the Russians will no longer vote for extremists.
A 54 - year - old teacher, 54 - year - old Tamara Tcherednichenko, concluded: “What do you think?
Those who are in power are not too wicked, why should they change? ”
A Long Memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, Bad Arolsen's national archives, which trace the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are free of access.
The 47 million files of archives, placed on 27 km of line at Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were so far only available for a "humanitarian" purpose, that is, individually and nominally, on the request of an old victim or his legal assistants.
The 11 States responsible for their management - Germany, France, Israel and the United States agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification of this Agreement by all States is completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitivity Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow research to be carried out "including on the movement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, a number of States, including Germany, opposed the opening up of these nominee documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of certain victims of deportation.
The records of concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo were collected after war for a practical purpose: finding civilians deported or subjected to forced labour and, if possible, giving evidence of their detention, to open the way to their compensation.
Still today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to wait for these documents," said Mr. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free exchange agreement in 2008
At present, indo-European bilateral trade has already reached EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
EU Foreign Ministers had given their last green fire to the European Commission in April to engage in negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asian). Indo-European bilateral trade has already reached EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th EU trade partner, according to the European Commission figures.
"A free exchange agreement will greatly double the two economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million Europe's prosperity," Peter Mandelson explained.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the ten first products exported by India, explained the European Commissioner. Asian and European genes exchange annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "10 billion euros of services", said this week by Daniel Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, reiterating that bilateral trade has not "not yet achieved its potential". The EU and India are returning to New Delhi on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering 10 billion books in five weeks
The Bank of England has said that it is likely that the current return of credit concerns will be reduced, and has announced an offer of ten billion books at the base rate of 5.75% in five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
"In order to ease the concerns under which the financial market conditions will be particularly closed at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organise their liquidity positions during this period, the Bank intends to provide an important proportion of its reserve contribution for the maintenance period starting on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," she said in a communication.
The bank states that 10 billion euros (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12H15 GMT, at the base rate and until 10 January.
This is the first time it seems that the BoE is placing on the market liquidity for five weeks in an open market operation.
These usually take place one week.
The BoE adds in its Communication that it is "ready to take other measures to maintain the rates" of interbank loans on a daily basis with its basic rate.
The interbank rate per day was 5.829 per cent Wednesday.
The rate for three months was 6.6 per cent, a higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the sums on the market by the Bank of England have been at an important level of criminality which has discouraged banks from taking advantage of it.
According to some Chambers, co-sponsored by the evolution of the book course compared to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts placed on the market by the European Central Bank at more favourable rates and with a more secure discretion.
UMP and NC reject the review of PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused to discuss articles of the socialist law proposal on purchasing power, which was equivalent to a rejection of the text.
In a socialist "neighbor" (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text referred to a dozen measures taken by the national PS office, including an increase of 50% of the premium for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a check-out or renting.
UMP and NC voting against the review of articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was held following the general discussion that led to exchanges, sometimes vifus, between majority and opposition to Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
The PS file manager Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the fullness of its proposals in the form of amendments to the draft corrective financing law considered by the Assembly next week.
A New Festival Sees the Day
As a result of numerous novels on the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter announces the Vienna Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the British producer Melvin Benn's Republic Festival.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who has, no more or less, inspired the current movement of festivals in America," said Charlie Jones of C3 in Billboard.com.
C3 is produced at the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is an excellent destination for the campsite.
The festival should be held from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres to about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Also known as Mean Fiddler, director of the Republic Festival, Melvin Benn, is one of the world's most respected festival producers.
In 1989 he took the reading Festival to the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and in 2006, the Republic Festival founded the Festival Latitude of Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury of the most inspiring event he's ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn work in parallel to give the region a European-style event.
“Our planes chose Philadelphia as a market and worked together with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the center of Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
“Our discussions with the city and the Commission were motivated and excited by this project.
Unfortunately, we are involved in policymakers because of the current administration, continued Charlie Jones.
"Happyly, we have been able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are about to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will eventually serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at the Grand Park in Chicago, after being marked in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals are held in the urban environment.
"Melvin Benn's European model is a campaign festival, while we have more space in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of the festival to the European and urban in the United States."
Vienna is near midway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Community of Vienna, including the mayor, actively supports the holding of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but says "that they are interesting enough to allow you to invest in such an event and to welcome a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the reception capacity of this festival is “too great” at the invitation of 80,000 people from Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed at the time they went under pressure.
"Vineland will be a great rock, but music will be varied, hoping to attract all sorts of viewers," says Charlie Jones.
C3's partners, who received the award Top Independent Promotion of the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faced the Terminator
It's not easy to arrest Hollywood film plates in Montreal when no other than Terminator is against it...
This seduction mission is part of the delegation's functions.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, condemns the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the "Governator" pads?
"It must be prudent, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to provide those who will judge the best," he says.
The Course at Festivals
For the moment, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of the film from here.
The course to Oscars is started.
It will be of all the festivals of the West Coast, whether of Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, the question of presenting the Quebec Films, putting them in value and ensuring that the performers are interviewing.
The December Age had a beautiful wine at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Québec also presented four long and four short trips to the American Film Institute Festival this month.
Will there be a year's end row in the race? Experts divided by the sub-primary crisis.
In less than five weeks of the end of the year, investors are already shaking their hands while waiting for the arrival of the traditional end-year rally.
However, this year experts are not as certain as this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in spring usually has a positive attitude.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts based solely on statistics, since, given the current context, there are uncertainty about markets, at least in the short term. "
Although they are not partners to take advantage of the season in the last weeks of the year, these experts note that "the bourgeoiser market is fed by liquidity, which is willing to invest in the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the impact of exit to quality values both in the long periods and in the shorts".
To this end, they believe that the exchange will have a rather side-by-side behaviour, with no exception of voltility "in particular because we do not know the impact of the likely decline in the federal rates, given the high level of gross and the risk of stimulating inflationist tensions"
Javier Barrio, responsible for sales of GDP in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say there will be a rally.
"That's not the best thing," says the expert.
Ibex, the Spanish bourgeoiser index, has lost nearly 4% since 8 November when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year to 16,000 points through the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to retirement schemes that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert knows that things will be a little different this year because he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the end of the Constitution festival (December 6th).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For its part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inverses Banco, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a re-enactment of the index that could be caused by information coming from the European Union regarding the impact of the credit market crisis".
The analyst hopes that those will be positive.
The analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading Ibex to new maximum costs.
Solana, from Intermoney, says "This year the great values are coming back for him."
The expert would include the two large banks and some manufacturers in the portfolio "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
As long as Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco, ensures that the houses will be from the bank and the industrial sector.
Constructors can also benefit from this rail, where they are located.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other structures such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," explains the expert.
cyclic consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to increased sales in the Christmas season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do so well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times seven years
During the last seven years, only two occasions during December was a lower month.
The authentic end-year round took place in 2003, during which bourgeois markets came from the crisis caused by the perception of the technological bubble.
This year, during which Ibex 35 recovered 28,17 per cent, the month of December recorded an increase of 6,68 per cent.
It will need to see whether 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for the moment Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it succeeds on its final year line.
The People's Bank will open 200 open offices 12 hours a.m. on Monday
The People's Bank has decided to renew a large part of its offices.
In total, 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These sugars, which will operate under the Max People's brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish agencies, since it is the first group that has decided to start working on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies up to 20 a.m. and to open on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 20 a.m.
Another group has also repeated several times that it would like to extend the hours of its subsidiary, BBVA, even if it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about concluding an agreement with trade unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening a afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the experience of the People's Bank will be decisive for other agencies to join this initiative that coincides with trade times.
That is exactly what the People's Bank is looking for.
Attack autonomous customers who travel in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and trades in selected streets to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies implemented throughout Spain for about 18 months, as it is not about opening new agencies but about a renewal of existing agencies.
To that end, the organization will modernise the branches already in the commercial areas, adapting them to the customer profile of the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the watches is accompanied by a different design from the interior of the sucursal and a new design, more current, with more bright colors.
Bank trader Ángel Rivera ensures that this renovation does not involve large investments, but the recruitment of staff, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine by agency.
The agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The People's Bank has already tested its initiative in three Madrid agencies.
And the experience has been positive, as Angel Rivero explains.
The streets of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and the Grand Vía of Madrid are the streets to have been chosen, and with apparent success, according to Rivero.
The People's Bank currently has 2,500 subsidiaries.
And 60 others working under the Mundocredit brand, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very wide hours, which open even Sunday and holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies, they will not copy the BBVA model, where several of its agencies have a large non-financial potential for their sale.
' We do not want to compete with our customers,' notes Rivero.
At the moment, they reached an agreement with Telephonica to sell mobile phones, with an external staff at the bank.
Double Telecinco for the first time the value in Bourse of its Antena 3 rival
We're here.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a delegate of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday at the conclusion of the bourgeoisie market, when he found that the chain he led doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One single aspect of his joy was: 'which hurts me, it's not the fact that we're going to increase, but that we're going down,' he said.
However, he stressed the fact that on a low market, 'we have fallen less '.
Telecinco finished the day with an increase of 2,54% last night.
This gain stabilizes its loss by 15.66% for a year.
The value in Exchange of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% in addition) thus reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg's data.
Its Antena 3 rival, which dropped 1,52 % yesterday and has increased by 40,5 % since January, costing half, 2.193,46 million.
The value of the other communications companies involved in Bourse is 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million in the case of Prisa (the editor of Cinco Días) and 1,779 million in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, comparison with Antenne 3 is the fact that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is what we are able to do, on the same market, at what price and how we pay it in terms of hearing. '
Telecinco announced last week that it would become the first television channel this year to exceed 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the branch that manages the group's advertising.
In order to make this announced data real, the television channel should record an increase of 3.6 per cent in its advertising bill compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
On the other hand, the net invoice of Antenne 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net TV revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution of Telecinco in Bourse is the important payout he has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the benefit among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio may vary after buying 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
' We have made the official commitment to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always made much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to whom we have already given titles with 33 per cent of Endemol '.
According to analysts, the market now gives signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers has recently reduced his estimates of the benefits on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009, to 7%.
This is due to the decline in expected income from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
The same company has reduced the expected gains from Antenne 3 to 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
It's the first time I've ever seen.
The Ibersecuritys company recommends buying the two values based mainly on its significant profitability of dividends and its long-term long-term long-term potential.
It's not like I'm here.
Caja Madrid sees more Telecinco (cumulative) than Antenne 3 for multiple attractions and business growth.
It's not like I'm here.
JPMorgan: it recommends examining the two cases as there have been similar threats (a satisfactorily market and a bad economic climate).
Congress approves the transmission of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of the Congress of Amendments incorporated into the draft Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with a view to its entry into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members and senators to negotiate and concentrate best regulation capable of ensuring the protection of investors and in detail regulating the activities of the agencies for the effective functioning of the markets.
The Mifid, which amends the Valuation Market Act, involves the modernization of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the powers of the Heads of the National Commission for the Valeurs Market (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the different leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will allow financial consultancy services to be provided both for special social reasons and for natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consultancy companies (AFI), which merge value companies, value agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of financial instruments operations, so that it is possible to add multilateral trading systems and internationalisation systems to regulated secondary markets, which are faced with competition from current exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment services companies to disclose on the market information on the key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management forms and requires them to keep a record of all operations they perform in order to facilitate the control of CMMV.
Through the Congress's Economic Commission, several amendments have been added, including one that points out that titled debt will be considered as a "complex" financial instrument, giving rise to the high risk for the investor, which has been demonstrated with the debt of American high-risk mortgages (substantiated).
In addition, they benefited from the transfer of the management to legalize the functions that graduates in the Economy may have 30 years after the adoption of the Royal Decree limiting the professional functions reserved for the economists in 1977.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the media, which will work for an enterprise, which will not require the authorisation of the CMMV and which will be able to provide its product marketing services and attract new customers to different investment firms at the same time.
The Harmonised Consumer Price Index increases by five decades in November, up to 4.1 %
This indicator, which is used after Eurostat for incorporating it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance on price developments in Spain during November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing comparable data in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as that employed for the Harmonised Consumer Price Index, but using various methods of statistical modelling to estimate information that is not yet available for publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, since it must not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be disclosed on 14 December next.
"IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
The second vice-president and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said that the increase of 4.1% of GDP in November was a "time figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index would continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes explained in the Congress's Colloirs that "although the figure is not good" the difference in Spain's inflation over the monetary union continues to be "more or less" than in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than during the previous month, when the Government did not face such a high increase.
"We are experiencing a figure of around 4%," recognized the Minister for Economic Affairs in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros in three years
Northern Rock's deposits fell by over 50 per cent to 12 000 million pounds (16,800 million euros) since the mid-September crisis and had to be used for emergency credit to the Bank of England.
At the time, it had collected a few records of over 25,000 million books, a figure that was gradually reduced in two and a half months due to the mistrust of its clients and despite the 100% guarantee of the money the Government has provided and will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would name the organization with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to take around a quarter of British banks' incomes that will be deposited in the next three years to obtain these 18.000 million remaining books until the target of 30,000 million is reached.
The Magnetic Group Richard Branson, known for its creative campaign in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million books (about 70 million euros) per year in advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named this week the offering of Virginia's association, with three other companies, including her favorite to save her from the bank.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard has stopped today early this morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the People's Party) because of its alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
In addition, one of the city council's secretaries and the chief police officer of the municipality was also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced me from May to May Juan Morales, the current right-wing Member, and until then the municipal councillor of the mayor, who, according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the Chanye SER, could be the 'manor' of this treaty.
Officials continue to exploit the municipal premises and those of the Urbanism Council, and there is no distinction between the possibility of new arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect of the traffic of urban corruption discovered early this week, was convicted.
As he pointed out yesterday at Chanye SER to the lawyer of the Member 'of the People's Party' Juan Morales, he was arrested by leaving the Home of Morales with important documentation in his possession on the tram.
In addition, according to the sources of the investigation, the subject of the investigation is the alleged arrival of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of a urban agreement with a construction company in Galice to requalify 200 hectares of land.
For the moment, there are eight people arrested.
Bono agrees to be at the head of the candidate of the Spanish Socialist Party for Tolede and to preside over Congress if they win elections
The former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be the head of the Spanish Socialist Party for Tolede for the next general elections and to be president of the Congress in case socialists will receive the general elections.
The Spanish socialist party's organization secretary, José Blanco, and Bono even announced it during a press conference following the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive justified the offer made to the former Minister because "it is important to rely on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
Furthermore, he stressed that "yes seems to be" that the political man of La Manche will be the candidate of the Socialist Group who will preside over the Congress if the Socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of the Congress, who, on 15 November last made public his decision not to present themselves to the next general elections and to abandon his political career in order to devote himself to combating climate change in the university framework.
The former Minister recognized that the President of the Government had not stopped insisting that he should return to the political pre-trials since he left it two years ago.
In addition, he noted that, although the citizens already knew who would be the vice-president of the economy if the Spanish socialist party received the elections, his party wanted to announce the President of the Congress in a "transparency act".
If it reaches the post, Bono hopes to transform the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or criticism" and to make "it looks more like the citizens".
"Sometimes it seems sad that Madrid's only place where we can't speak peacefully and quietly is Congress, the President of the Government of the Senate has been interrupted 26 times at times."
In the same way, he had words of condemnation for his current president, Manuel Marín and "not knowing how to do it" and he did not want to do as if he had already taken his position to avoid falling, as he noted, in what his enemies might consider as "a domination".
A Climate Promotion
Since the movement against climate change is subject to unmerited persecution as well as the sceptics of its predictions and those who give priority to other political and social battles, it must show a fair consistency.
It is much more the case for a leader of the movement who is the President of the Government as Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach is a duty to explain why the action, or inaction, of its Government has made a decisive contribution to whether Spain is at the head of the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who are responsible for non-execution, in which sectors it has produced, and why its Government, the one with the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spanish what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizens' habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy economies will be forced to do, what economic consequences this will have.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay for saving the planet.
But there's no explanation and there's no explanation.
Just because it's about sacrifice and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are imputable.
Costs, unsatisfying and threatening for the accounts of companies and individuals.
Up to the 1st century of the essence proposed by the Spanish socialist party seemed to him literally so dangerous to Zapatero that he was impressed by the night.
It is to say that it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With words of impact, committees, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman is so useful for the electoral campaigns that he does not speak, who does not complain and who does not demand, invites meetings and inspires the trend.
As long as this is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and who does not claim that we are moving on a bicycle or that we are refrigerating with the possibility.
The mayor and chief of the local police of Totana arrested for a alleged trauma of urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcian localities of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the Mary and a suspect hotel entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, have reported the sources of the investigation today.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and was taken to the city hotel, where there were many agents, who were also present to the Urban City Council and the municipal management company of the Industrial Sun and the Accommodation.
These three arrests are accompanied by six arrests last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land for urbanization so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 dwellings after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are involved in the judicial investigation, which is taught by the Totana Court No. 1.
The first six prisoners have been brought to court today.
According to sources, the former municipal councillor of Totana and currently autonomous parliamentarian of the PP party, Juan Morales, is the subject of the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a property agency currently registered in Totana, was involved, as well as the former municipal councillor's current firm, who lives in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonauur, agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the wines would have been carried out.
The investigation was carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Gendarmerie, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, carried out 11 inspections, the majority of companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
So one person was arrested in Totana, in fact, the owner of a very well-known airline company in the region, who may have played the role of the intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired 2.2 million square metres of land that have been requalified and its project would be expected to double the population of the municipality, which currently accounts for 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are engaged in real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages Vigo parkings in Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico streets; Hogartel, which is concerned with direct marketing; Precomiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction materials.
Things That Happen

It's not like I
Our Finnish correspondent provides us with a comment on yesterday's most important journal in Finland (certain in the heads of information PISA above the educational level in the world), the Helsinki Sanomat, referring to what they published on November 18, the same day when he appeared there, carefully, the criticism of the book Blackburn:
"The content of the course of Philosophy interfered with public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The dead man, a Baccalauréat student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Philosophy Education Council, Pekka Elo, called for teachers to adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written on the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat and said that studying Nietzsche is not necessary in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in lycées."
It's not like I
A colleague provides information on the introduction to the Criminal Code of Crimes on Internet downloads:
A. The downloading of a song would be a sin of a six-month sentence of one year.
On the other hand, the flight in a CD Store for a value of less than EUR 400 is considered to be only a mistake (Article 623.1).
B. The flight in a store for a value up to EUR 1,000 is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for download (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you want a car and you make it 40 hours later, the penalty is lower than that imposed for download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less important to participate in a baggage than to participate in the traffic of compact discs.
Participating in a tumour bager involves a three-month penalty per year (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and CD traffic would involve a six-month penalty for two years.
(Article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered to be less serious than downloading a film under article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without author's permission is more criminal than the distribution of pornography to minors (article 186).
Finally, if my colleague is in the truth then someone's exaggerating.
I'm sorry.
My medical doctor spoke to me about one of his articles on foreign research: 'The money produced by brain activity, especially if others received less '.
In other words, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was conducted through magnetic resonances at Bonn University, and the results were published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, director of the study and director of the neuro-cognition group of Life&Brain Institute: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed".
The researchers noted that when the two persons claimed to receive the same payment, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, the activation was larger.
I don't know if this conclusion would require so much science.
The Balkans Prosecutor
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has consistently continued the war crimes of the Balkans since the Public Ministry of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which is located in The Hague.
Its mandate ends at the end of the year and Carla is angry with the love, because the main officials of Srebrenica's murder - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims are dead - former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic are still free.
Their names are in this list, which the Swiss documentary Marcel Schüpbach takes his title, the list of Carla ' (2006, not designed exclusively in Spain), with the speed of a police strike, following the work of the Swiss prosecutor in Belgrade, New York, who continues to expel criminals and pressure the governments involved to retreat the circle.
What kind of insurance do I deserve?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of any left-hand side, involves an important expenditure that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, driving age, civil status, type of vehicle to be secured or used, among others.
Having a car is the main one.
And that, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
And it is even harder to choose the vehicle model than to choose the appropriate car insurance.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurance company.
This undertaking is made up of an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the premium granted and, in exchange, becomes responsible for the obligation to pay the compensation in case of a fine.
The first is the price of insurance, which is determined by different factors, such as age, sex, driving age, civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the type of use it is used, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that the higher the likelihood of an accident is higher, the higher the rate to be charged is higher.
That is why people over 25 years of age and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower rate of sistros than they are.
In the same way, by using censuses, companies have concluded that married persons tend to have fewer accidents than celibate drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
As the frequency increases the probability increases.
They are many variables that insurance policymakers take into account when setting the price of the premium.
That is why the driver must carefully examine the situation in order to choose the car insurance that is best adapted to his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or more insurance types, so that, in addition to adapting to the insurance characteristics, it offers a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 must face various disadvantages when entering into a contract with insurance at an affordable price, such as low experience in driving and age.
Although the ideal for being well-insured is a risk-free insurance, other more economic options exist.
The most predictable drivers can choose for insurance any risk with franchise, so that they obtain cover of insurance at any risk but at a more affordable price.
This form of convention implies that the customer pays part of the amount of the left.
"The part of the left-wing amount that the customer will pay will be established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher than the amount will be low," said Luis Noguera, the first European official in Spain, online insurance mediator.
Another option is third-party insurance, so that the client will ensure protection against damage caused to third-party users, but by those caused by their own car.
In addition, it would be covered against the flight, fires and vehicle loss.
A council.
If you are less than 25 years of age, try to be careful and avoid the sidewalks as far as possible, as this will affect the bonus, which may reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A grant is a reduction in the basic rate owned by the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic rate.
"Banctions and sanctions will depend on the company and its benefits.
If the company had had a good year, it could be allowed to increase the subsidies ", explains Noguera.
Over the past 25 years, this has made it easier for drivers to pass a contract with insurance, as the rate of skimming is reduced through the accumulated experience.
That is why it is preferable to choose insurance at any risk with franchise.
"Only young people can't benefit from the experience of an accident after an accident," the director of the European company in Spain ensures that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of conduct, once the fear of the news has passed. "
However, if the client is married but has not yet had children, it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at any risk, as long as his economic situation allows him.
Marriages with children are considered by the insurers as being people with the lowest degree of synergy, as the majority will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be a risk insurance with franchise (may be EUR 300), or a third-large insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insurance is available at a high level of bonus.
"They have a more detracted behavior and have a greater purchasing power to allow the luxury to assume a more important quantity of franchises," judges Luis Noguera.
In the case of deductions, a risk insurance with franchise is preferable (which is EUR 150) or a third-large insurance when the insurance is available at a high level of bonuses.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of leftover circumstances, but also because it represents an important expense, that is why it is essential to study the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
Celtic will seek to win a point in Milan to reach the finals
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow have joined the next Tuesday in San Siro to look for the point that they lack to achieve their respective objectives in closing the League of Champions, as it serves Italians to be the first and the Ecossais to classify themselves.
The Italians have completed ten points and have already qualified for the fifth day through a zero match in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgov has nine points, but it still needs another point to make sure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfifia who has four, is not going ahead of him.
These two matches of Group D will be held one week before the sixth day ends, as Milan AC has to discuss the semi-finals of the World Club Cup in Japan on 13 this month in search of a place for the end of December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the zero match at the Giuseppe Meazza Stadium seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out victorious, because the Italians will not want to specialize in them, and the Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it will be the first and will ensure a better crossover in the late eighths.
A failure of Gordon Strachan's team could be sufficient to classify if Shakhtar Donetsk does not get it, but she will not be able to computer on it only because with nine points the game goes back to Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who got (2-0) in the other direct hole.
Thus, the Milanians will try to compensate for the evening for the Ecossais, who had a good hope to class themselves for the eighth finals for the second time at the League Championships, after having been beat during the last edition by a Kaka goal during the extensions (1-0).
While waiting for the victory of the 'rossoni' triumph, the triumph would only return to Shakhtar, where Celtic would lose, to classify for the eighth finals in order to continue the union of the UEFA champions.
And it is that Benfifia, although it is the last and no longer possible to pursue European competition, could be the third place with a winner.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tournament in Vancouver
The Spice Girls started in Vancouver, Canada, before some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the group disappeared in 2000.
' Posh Spice ' (Victoria Beckham), ' Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver Stadium that the group meeting was "extended".
About 20,000 people have posted the tickets to attend the concert, which is the subject of a video that tells the story of the group that became violent at the end of 1990.
The World Meeting and Tournament coincides with the launch of a new album that repeats their main success as well as two new songs, Headlines and Voodoo, published by EMI in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls are mounted on stage by showing the bracelets that the 'posh Spice' couple had offered them, British footballer David Beckham.
The sport was in the public that filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had forbidden it a few days earlier.
Before the show started, Victoria Beckham noted that the British football player "did not see our costumes, so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think of the show".
' Sporty Spice ', who is part of the group in 1998, "because of differences between us" and who has caused the group to be dissolved two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a press interview, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw people's feelings changed, the feeling for Spice Girls changed.
And I didn't think why, I'm happy to have made a decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting she left nine years ago.
The singer also noted that in time, "the things were arranged and that we appreciated them very much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl appeared for the last time in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV TV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special plane from Virgin Airlines.
When they arrived at the airport, a baby army waiting for them.
They count on her five seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will be in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and December 7th).
They'll be in Madrid on December 23.
The new gas case between Russia and Ukraine rejects the alarm.
A serious debate on the gas price between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of impact on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (U.E.) are carried by gas pipelines, and each pipeline is closely monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increased the fuel cost, it would increase transit rates in Russia.
Last year, an alteration between the two had resulted in a decrease in supplies to the countries of the United States.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurs after the Ukrainian Government and Gazprom, a Russian gas-owned monopolie company, had tried to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas provided in Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would increase, as planned, its prices in Ukraine as soon as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
The analysts stated that this would involve Ukraine, an increase of 40% of the import costs from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the negotiations, remembering that we are a country through which most of the gas passes," announced Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh to the Reuters press agency.
"The fluctuations in gas costs would certainly be related to our discussions on transit taxes (to Western Europe) through Ukraine"
The last major change between Moscow and Kiev occurred in January 2006, the interruption of the gasprom supplies for Ukraine.
This has led to the fall in exports to Western Europe, resulting in price increases.
The Russian gas represents a quarter of the supplies of the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, even though most of them are still under development.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies with the gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health must control its foreign employees.
The Ministry of Health must improve controls on its extra-Community employees to check whether they have criminal records, the Committee of Auditors said.
The general auditor's warning, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland, was involved in the attack at the airport of Glasgow in June.
In addition, Mr. Black expressed his concern that the Ministry of Health had no specific data on the number of overseas persons employed.
Its report has also been drawn up by other decision-making controls, which have been correctly carried out on a sample of employees of five health authorities.
The Auditor-General checked the extra-Community staff following the attack on the airport of Glasgow.
Bilal Adullah, 28 years old, a doctor of Iraqi origin at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after having slept with his jeep in the doors of the main terminal.
He was part of three doctors who were filmed in Old Bailey in October, suspected of being involved in various car bombing attempts in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff, to be some of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and working permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Department of Ecossais uses the Ecossaese Disclosure to carry out criminal checks, the Agency has no right to obtain such information outside Great Britain.
Among the many warnings, the General Auditor-General's report now states that the committees are now obliged to deal with the Office of Criminal Control, thus allowing employers to take control over various countries.
“Although we have discovered that some information about staff has been well verified, this has not been done at all times,” the report announces.
Mr. Black said that the Department of Ecossian Health had carried out most of the pre-employment checks that he himself would do, but he added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved in order to ensure that adequate information on certain members of the overseas staff is available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Ecosse, stated that it was “very unlikely” that pre-employment controls could identify employees who could commit future acts of terrorism.
He stated that "the report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently carried out are well functioning in the health system and that these warnings are not certain that they can bring some added value."
The Scottish health authorities have declared that 1161 foreign people, made up of most doctors and nurses, are employed.
However, the Auditor-General stressed that these figures must certainly be revised to increase, partly because of problems with the identification of members of the staff with a fixed-term contract, who could choose to remain in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current health control procedures in Ayrshire and Aran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian are all appropriate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Government of Scotland is currently reviewing its policy and pre-employment control system for staff other than the Ocean of Health Service.
The Secretary for Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was eager to carry out this work following the terrorist attack at the airport of Glasgow."
She added that the Government of Scotland, together with the health committees, would carefully consider the warnings contained in the report that should be published next month, and would be committed to ensuring a better implementation of recently updated pre-employment controls, which are valid for all employees, including foreign personnel.

Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 soldiers to protect the sites following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
Citing a statement by the Minister of the Interior, the newspaper stated that 18 persons arrested belong to a cell led by a “mission launching expert” who was infected in the country.
It was said that the militarists were planning against the eight-mission band in the kingdom.
22 persons among the detainees would seem to have committed the murder of ecclesiastical and armed forces.
The Government asked the churchists to do more against the Saudis in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda's soldiers fighting the Allied Forces and the Muslim Shiite Government in the United States, considered to be heretics according to the strict line of Saudis Sunny.
Al Qaeda's activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clergymen have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that governs the government.
Soldiers, encouraged by appeals against the Western Saudi Government, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda of Saudi origin, have targeted foreign residential areas, government property and energy supply sites.
Important efforts have been made by the armed forces during the last five months" declared the word door of the Minister of the Interior to state television.
Among the prisoners, 16 members of the Median are organized into a "mediatic cell" to promote "takfiri thought", the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals who support the use of violence against unbelieving and apostate Muslims.
Of the detainees, 32 persons were charged with subsidizing the military.
Venus's climate could reveal the future of the Earth.
The scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a beautiful planet to live.
The data from the European orbital vessel showed that the planet is certainly two times smaller than the Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the nearest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those of Earth, and could even have been inhabited.
But the greenhouse effect from carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion caused by solar radiation associated with a slower rotation led Venus to any other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is excavated by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a hot surface to melt the cloud.
The findings of Venus Express, the European Space Agency survey, which studied the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of the Earth's potential future due to catastrophic climate change.
Professor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "We begin to understand the reason why Venus's climate is so different from that of Earth, even though the planets in them are practically similar.
"Our new data enables us to establish a scenario where thousands of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, possibly even with a living area."
From the rich uranium secreted by the police.
A kilogram of radioactive material, apparently of uranium, was stolen by the Czech and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer stated that three persons had been arrested and that the material was currently analysed.
He did not confirm that it is a good uranium, but revealed that the market would have a value of $1 million (£480.000).
Open to All
Mitt Romney declared not to be high as a presidential candidate, to answer the questions of a good snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidates at the presidency finally agreed to participate in the debate on You Tube, during which many ordinary voters had recorded their questions, subject them to candidates.
Wednesday evening, November 28th, none of the questions raised were as ridiculous as it came up with another debate on You Tube, when a nice man asked the Democrats their position on the recovery of the planet.
This time, however, questions and answers were very much reflected in the conditions of the Republican party, who were candidates for the next elections.
We don't know what criteria, CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose You Tube's clips to show the candidates.
But the first half of the debate, the longest on one theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strongest subjects for the Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they heard interesting things: The region had raised approval waves when the candidates expressed themselves in a large way.
The toughest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is head of important early elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to relieve himself of the fact that he was comfortable about the clandestine immigration during his mayor's mandate in New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, to employ the clandestine immigrants at his home.
The two combatants became particularly happy when they were asked whether they would be willing to promote an "admission" (providing the prisoners a regular status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Congressman, have succeeded in deepening this issue.
None of them have the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have begun to fight immigration before and more intensively than others.
In general, candidates, at least with regard to immigration, have the same opinions: more rigid boundaries, and zero tolerance for immigrants.
This subject, coupled with the concerns raised in particular by the issue of toxic games produced in China, or of other fear of the outside world, encourages the Republicans to forget, or minimize divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly disturbing when other issues were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr Romney discussed whether to put water into the nose should be considered torture.
One of the participants asked if the candidates believed in the whole of it, in the contents of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to say that the Bible is his favorite book, even if it is not about to believe in the history of Jonas and the whale.
Another interviewer asked whether Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
We did not expect to see Mike Huckabee, - in Paul's position in Iowa during a recent election, thanks to his long-term Christian conservativeism - to declare that the death penalty is painful as necessary.
When we insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus is too cuddly to present himself to the election.
The human race remains unsolutely open to all.
Mr. Huckabee's remount in Iowa coincides with recent progressive research of grants conducted by libertarian Ron Paul, and the syllables during the Wednesday debate.
These two are emerging from the baby, because the two protected parties do not agree to decide who is the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unifys the part of good time and convincingly thanks to a message of success on the Americas that so approached the leaders.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of the Workers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to sleep; even if he was fired, the situation wouldn't change.
In view of the tendency of British scandals, this is not particularly judicious.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel invoices of politicians, no extra conjugal foot dues.
But this is what a revelation indicates that a rich man of business would have been masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), which the party would not have declared: A new battle with Gordon Brown would have happened well.
Two months ago, the prime minister took a step back in his election project, falsely challenging British intelligence claiming that the polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such Vince Cable, the brilliant liberal leader of democracy, said that the terrorist Mr. Brown had transformed Stalin into Mr. Bean.
Northern Rock's arrest, a bank in difficulty on the crack board, showed a lack of guidelines and medical judgement in case of an emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative burden.
A trio of generals in retreat launched a revolution among the Lords, protesting the reduction of military expenditures: they declared that being a defence minister was a part-time job for them.
At present, the suspicion of false donations by David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of the Workers (and his former head of oversight) have led to their resignation.
None of that means that Mr. Brown is heading instantly to the exit.
Governments can, however, reach a point where it would be impossible to rule.
People don't like politicians, and they don't trust them, but they usually leave their doubts behind when a new government comes to power.
It seems clear that a prime minister cannot improve things, not even rule for a long time, when he is at risk of suspension: the public administration is no longer functioning; the cabinets of ministers are balanced; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government is becoming defensive and without any purpose.
In a sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot be a beginner.
Although he would like to refer to Tony Blair, he was also his superior employee.
The problems related to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr Brown's decisions taken when he was Chancellor of the British treasurer.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair's injuries, such a long investigation into the funds of the party's "money accounting for the members of the House of Lords", the voters might think otherwise.
But the difficult situation facing Mr Brown is not so tragic that she's in the air.
The gaffes are not as demonstrable as the members of the Tories party believe.
Like Mr. Bean, there's no victim or scroker.
And the solution, although painful, could always be to establish the Stalinian trends of Mr Brown, in favour of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new political data scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special person, comparing his gifts with charity, said that he did not want any public recognition of his welfare.
He may have his opinion, but that's not his decision.
The laws against the anonymity of major policymakers are clear, and they exist for a good reason: the public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who declared himself to be in the course of the programmes of Mr. Abrahams, not knowing that this was illegal, would therefore have to be questioned, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, who was responsible for the collection of grants that had spoken of suspicious data in October.
But so far, Mr Brown has not been involved: nothing can be said that he has been in the course of these trends, even though most of the payments made have been made following his arrival in the government in June.
So far, the prime minister has done half of it.
He quickly condemned the legislative failure of his party, but did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making authority is based on a course he knows well, to appeal to a committee of inquiry on this issue made up of a widow to the resignation and judge.
In this case, learning lessons are not complicated.
And if the law has been abolished, it's the police's source.
In addition, there are many other things Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Public Standards, without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on the financing of political parties.
This would force the Labourist party, in a moment of weakness, to cooperate with the Torians, which could lead him to reject his particular financial report with the confederations; in short, a rather expensive pill for such a partner as Mr Brown.
But he should face some divisive facts.
Some of the conservatives now have a good advantage for the elections; they have two years to regain the electors, and the only way to gain a victory is to demonstrate an irrevocable integrity and strong competence.
Scrooques of cards.
Would the mortgage crisis pollute the US credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see attached nagers, turn around.
Now that the US real estate market is going through a critical phase, the predictors look at the US credit card market.
Goldman Sachs' analysts believe that losses related to credit cards could amount to $99 billion if the contamination spreads hypotheses to other forms of credit to the consumer.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in the rates of costs and insolvency, which measure the shares of the unrecoverable balance or which are, more than 30 days after.
HSBC announced last month that it had taken $1.4 billion in its credit to the consumer, partly because of the lack of card holders.
It's just too fast to panic.
Costs and insolvency are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% of the third quarter is almost one point compared to its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change of laws in 2005 to the United States, with regard to personal banking, caused a broken down of banknote archives, which, in turn, caused serious loss of credit cards; the number of files (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if the terms of the loan were to be used.
The industry also announces fixed rates of payment, which will set off the monthly end-of-life sum that consumers need to adjust.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is strong enough despite the parallelization of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the emission volume for 2007 would be 25% higher than last year.
The direct links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market are certain to exist: consumers could prefer to increase their savings now that equity real estate loans have disappeared.
However, card issuers pay more attention to the flow of species than to the value of heritage, and therefore the loss of real estate prices did not necessarily result in a change in the credibility of investors.
They could even benefit credit issuers.
Consumers' contributions to the payment of mortgages fall if property costs less than the value of the loan; therefore, credit card lending would be a priority to reimburse all.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with greater flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or change credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid recovery of actions.
"We will not wake up one morning and reevaluate all the loans." said Gary Perlin, director of Capital One.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a resulting decline.
If the lower prices of real estate and a contract in the credit market lead America to recession, the industry will certainly face a difficult future.
Take good care of the dorsal nags..
The British bankers complain about the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were supposed to witness their roles in relation to a fraud committed by Enron's former financial director, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, complaining that they had no faith.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were first declared innocent of seven alleged fraud charges in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial fraud to increase the pressure of their employees.
They should present themselves to the Court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by U.S. Justice Ewing Werlein Jr., they all declared guilty of committing a fraud.
The three former Greenwich NatWest branches, a PLC branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland, have become famous throughout Britain because of the two-year extradition procedures.
In the United States, their case remains an issue pending for this investigation following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges against them in 2002 revealed to Fastow that he was the subject of the government's investigation in the aftermath of Enron.
The charges against the bankers, including the "three of Natwest", were declared to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a false scenario with Fastow and his ex-branch, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a branch of an Enron-controlled partner, who was the founder of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him to call the banking procedures.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had valued its interest in the branch as nothing, but the three British already knew its value.
A company controlled by Kopper purchased the interest of the branch bank for £1 million.
Bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as an interest for this company.
According to the charge, Fastow had falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its operations in the branch.
But in fact these $20 million are gone in the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers would have received $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow applied for his active role in two conspiracies in Enron's debulgation.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow was sentenced to six years' imprisonment in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is imprisoned for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released after payment of $1 million each, which required them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, before the seventh largest national company, in the banking sector in December 2001 after years of accounting calls, could no longer hide its billions of identitys or even propose its cheap specs.
The collapse has resulted in thousands of licences, more than $60 billion in market value losses and more than $2 billion in losses for retirement plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and former President Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skinling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against the Law for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes have been dropped because of its death due to a heart attack last year.
We're not alone, we're out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream plane, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel autonomy to fly without the Moscow scale in Los Angeles, part of $54 million.
But that's just a little change for some Russians.
"He can transport up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"Even if no one really needs so many seats that it is more than a family use plane or the president of a company."
Mr. Firer was present at the stand at the Gulfstream last Friday at the Millionaires Salon, a consumer-incentive organ for four days, held in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their positions, hoping to attract the interest of the new Russian rich for their products, leaving yachts on their way up to 50 cents full of diamonds cars.
Mr. Firer examined a brilliant orange porsche, exposed on the side of his stand.
"This is a nice car, but nothing compared to our product" he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private airport market."
"With a boom of oil, the Russian capital seems to roll in black gold, such as Dallas"
"We have lived the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans have become so rich and have landed in Europe where they would be regarded as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, senior student of the Department of Russian and Eureka Studies at Harvard University."
Like the Saudis in the 70s, the Japanese in the 90s, the Russians are emerging as the world's largest expenditures.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in Klondike.
This week, in another location in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry enabled Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to follow up on the sale of luxury goods to markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billion dollars worth of $282 billion, according to the list Forbes listing the richest people.
In addition, two thirds of the wealth consists of 103 billion Russians, totaling $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists of the economic and financial research centre.
(the World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
“ There are hundreds of millions in Moscow, and that is why we are all here, ” said Mr. Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London bijott.
She participated in the salon for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, the Soho Bijoutier Group.
“ Women are all well-prepared and men are worth a fortune. ”
Walking in the hall, Sunday evening, the two real estate agents on their 31st, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 declared to be their clients, millions.
"I looked at the cars and tried to choose between the Infinite, Mercedes and Porsche," said Melle Yumatova, who knew her high-end dress as a red taper such as Joan Rivers.
The salon seems first to look at the new rich, the kind of Russian brand buyers willing to make the hole in their mouth to come to an enormous store where Cadillac Escalades, platinum cannifes, Mövenpick glasses, personalized billboards, Dubaii apartments, and Gund temples.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"the Russians are interested in defining the most expensive brands and the best ones," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat on the Royal Hall of Manufacture of Dutch Porcelain Delf, in front of a wall table of Raimbrant on blue carts, made his hand.
"it is certain that Russians are more interested in bling bling"
In fact, sellers have stated here that Russians holding old capitals (10-15 years are too old according to Russian standards) have already passed logos to a limited edition brand that could not be sold in the hall.
Nevertheless, thousands of people, millions of people, millions of people, or tourists, are exposed every day.
And some even buy it.
During the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the PDG of King Koil's lits, declared to have sold two sets of apples, cashmere, and a coat of golden sons.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 motorcycles, a company that runs cars with the latest critical alarm systems, also told him that he had sold to a million Russians, the orange bright Porsche, for $170,000.
On Sunday after noon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that personalizes luxury cars, said he would sell three cars similar to those for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be decorated with Swarovski crystals so that it resembles a wheelchair.
The seven of four costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants reds made of auroch skin, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not drive heavily with such pines," said Karapetiian.
He will certainly keep her in his garage with 30 or 40 vehicles already »
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian stated that the expression "munitionaire Russian" is not in the order of the day, given the increase in the price of the real estate here.
"If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in kind," he said.
"There's more than you can think"
Those who are not millions can at least feel this emotion when they go to the state of the Continental Alliance, a Russian parent company.
The company raised four stops representing the British telephone booths, filled with a lot of counter-attack dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionnaire Hall.
Passive arrests to launch billboard masses, ask their friends of photographers on their cell phone, in the beautiful environment of this fake rich or well-approaching a few million.
“You see, here in Moscow, the world can feel a millionaire,” said Mr. Karyev.
Unsatisfied homicide surgeon in New Jersey
It was thanks to Ronald Livingston's guard when he watched the restaurant's live bathroom just a little Healthier and observed an ambulance that was about to stop at the gates of the White Cape Cod on the West Scott Avenue.
Then comes the police patrol.
and then another.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop," said Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, said Wednesday.
That's where I realized someone was dead.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a management performed by an unwelcome cosmetic surgeon, who has not yet identified the police, resident at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Melle Arroyo's death, but they are confident that the results of the toxicological tests that will take time, but which should help to resolve this mysterious death that has exposed the high levels of Newark's police.
Melle Arroyo was the assistant of the police director, Gary F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and his voice was well-known in several departments.
She was loyal, very hardworking and tenacious," Mr. McCarthy said about Melle Arroyo in a telephone interview, Wednesday. »
"she was like a pit bull"
"it would have done anything to protect me"
Mr. McCarthy said that Melle Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, an ex officer of the Newark Police who worked for the Committee on the Control of Alcoholics, and that she left two children aged 14 and 11 years, as well as a beautiful daughter.
Eileen Walsj, speaking from the Union County Park, Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives were trying to determine whether Melle Arroyo was killed because of an unauthorized surgical operation.
"It's an opportunity to consider."
"the investigation continues."
The authorities declared that they had arrived at her house at 15 p.m.
and have found Melle arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little more than a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Melle Walsh could not confirm whether Melle Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to understand whether part of the house was used as a medical office.
Mercredi, no one opened the door at Melle Castro's house where a fan of roses stood in the middle of the cemetery before, and a Dalmatian refused behind.
A blue bead called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for the kitchen bathroom and for perfumes, it was thrown into a hangar, next to a door leading to the ground.
Two bicycles all over the area covered on the sides.
McCarthy stated that since his arrival in Newark 25 years ago, at the New York Police Department, Melle Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping him to sail into the new city and abandon his established political culture.
"she said "you must pay attention to this," he said.
"She was here when I arrived, and still there when I was born.
"It Was Taking Away"
The United Nations hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce the rates associated with the world boutique.
The actions were expressed by the two sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm the terms of the credit, thereby reducing the rates of interest promised by the appelling statements of the Vice-President of the Central Bank.
Boursier markets explode in London, New York and around Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Ben Bernanke, president of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide should be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in the financial markets.
Mr. Kohn, in his clear efforts to reassure the markets of irritability in view of these new credit-related tensions, said that recent turbulence has partly "inverted some improvements in the functioning of the market in late September and October.
In the event that this heavy turbulence was to continue, this would increase the likelihood of further rigid financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a sign that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital in the US markets, and that further reductions in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These notes have also allowed Wall Street to calm down with even worse news on the US economy, such as the largest drop in real estate sales for the month of October.
The impact of this financial storm was increased following the Bear Stearns' statement, the Investment Bank, announcing that it would license 650 persons, i.e. 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs of compensation for the heavy losses incurred by the Parises in the loss of real estate loans.
Only 20 posts are planned in London where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones increased from 331 points, or 2,55%, to 13.289.40 while the largest index, S&P 500, took 2.65%.
In London, FTSE 100 took 165.5 points, or 2.7%, resulting in 6306.2 adding more than 39 £ to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 took 2.3%.
Previously, the recovery of credit difficulties in the markets has been in line with the strong demand for a sale of three-month fund balances over the European Central Bank, which has broken these loans to European trading banks at a high rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the FED and the ECB and to inject funds into the London financial markets resulting from credit tensions has led to three monthly loan rates "Libor" for the British banks, leading to their higher growth since last September, to 6.59 per cent following a strong increase since 12 November.
England faces a call for judgement in relation to the criticisms of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We face two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the winner no.6 for the British in Candy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as wide as the first Test against Sri Lanka, which will take the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the electors, who was here exceptionally to help Peter Moores, the chief coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make his decision, and because the Office of Hugh Morris, the Director-General of England, begins to complete the application forms to become a national electorate, at least in part.
The one who does not come to win the n°6 dosard will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport is also.
It is never easy to identify what allows a man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach the lowest level, sometimes by lack of chance more than by lack of ability.
There is only a cricket that selection is difficult because eventually judgment remains subjective.
Is it a good time to wake up Bopara?
Is that right with Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, choosing between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both, new frameworks having obtained good diplomas, professionals, should be promoted: but there is only room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the fair level of a cricket unless at least one chance is given to him?
The figures are important in the decisions, but also opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket must capture the captain's eye, while he must take the door and a batter must be lucky to touch the cricket one day.
But catching the eye of the electors is much more complicated.
Many have done better in the last season, for example, James Anderson, who seemed like some to play the first test, even though Stephen Harmison had declared himself fully and continued to be trained to serve.
Anderson took 32 first class doors on 33 towers to get a place.
Chris Tremlett took 29 to the same average, but both have already lived their time of glory at the highest level and hope to offer yet.
If it's Shah or Bopara who's gonna play in Asgiriya City, that's just an opinion question.
This choice could either cancel or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Garreth Batty played in each test and succeeded in the first, with five doors and 40 useful towers, but this was Paul Collingwood, who also struggled to emerge, who succeeded in becoming the primary critic of the Test, despite the fact that his two hundred marks against Australia can still be estimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at the Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and will contribute to Shah's greatest experience in the absence of young Bopara.
The two have good arguments.
In the favor of Shah, its brilliant and considerable start to the innnings of the 88 Test in Bombay, 32 percent of the first class against six for Bopara, which is 22 years younger and is excellent for launch.
But Shah did not make ten rounds during his two internships in May against the Caribbean during the Lord's Test, his city of the Middlesex player, and that, the immediate rejection by the electors when Vaughan is again in shape, claims his place for the next match, it seems to have been so obvious in Bombay.
Unlike him, Essex's player is happy to live.
Nothing scares him on a cricket field and he grew up when he was recently captivated on a 4x4 in a presentation by Volkswagen, a sponsor of England.
He reported only slight injuries, he was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone and call Alastair Cook, his remote crew, to ask him if he had seen this?
Bopara is far the best fighter, his flying wing allows him to perform the services he will want, and he beats him with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right moment is another.
Can it be the true art of the selection?
I'd rather give Bopara his chance, which doesn't mean that Shah shouldn't apply if, like the tea leaves suggest, he'll be playing this weekend.
The buses bring people to work, and fight against al Qaeda.
The first bus full of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, passing these refugees without money or visa renewals, or others who hope that the city has found normal.
Some have returned to fight the militants who have distanced them from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 people transported in twelve bus vans of the official government, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because I saw the TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is stronger now."
"They say that Mahdi's army is no longer committing crimes!" he said, referring to the Shia militia of the Ecclesiastical militant Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to stay away for the moment.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher in the Amariah area dominated by the Sunni, returned with his two children, because he could no longer renew his Syrian vision and because the regime prevented the Iraqis from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariah called him to inform him that the United States-supported militia had allowed Al Qaeda to escape from the west of the capital, and invited him in.
One of Jordan's new arrivals was the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home in northern Baghdad because of an attack on the grenade after he had forced the citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me to put in place an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I'm going today," said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many say that they have been attracted by the growing accalm of capital since the American troops arrived, and with the aim of continuing training of well-armed "citizen groups" and working with American soldiers to defend their neighbourhood.
But others say that they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the decline of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have been in the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old, father of three children, expressed the suspicion all over visas for exile as Nuri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, who would have asked the Syrian government to limit people to enter the country.
More than two and a half million people would have been from the country due to sectoral deaths.
"We did not have a problem until Al-Maliki arrived in Syria and encouraged the Government not to look at the Iraqis anymore, in order to force them to return to Iraq," Sunni said.
“ I can’t trust a government that supports criminals who burned my home when I’m part of it. ”
The reduction of violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis were evacuated from Shia and vice versa, creating places where tension is lower.
It is feared that a Sudanese flow of refugees will no longer increase sectoral tensions and reduce fighting.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest federal state is engaged in vocational training, and it is even shining by the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained for the first 50th time to a non-Sarrois, that we are not French" - it is the slogan that the smallest federal state, by self-determination, shows for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Sarre training system, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economy in Cologne.
Thus, already traditionally, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The University was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies by double, or a triple degree.
It bears witness to the high rate of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
Sarre also leads the children of the country to higher schools in higher than average - many of them without a university in Gymnasium.
"In Sarre, we benefit from the professional training system," says Axel Plünnecke, a training expert at IW.
More than one in five earns their degree in a professional school, so Sarre is located at more than seven points above the national average.
The possibilities of combining vocational and academic training are also relatively well developed.
In view of the number of residents, the double course is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and growing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has dropped from one third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Sarrois Education forced higher schools to a marketing campaign in engineering sciences.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a spokesman from the Ministry of Education.
The Government has thus introduced comparison tests throughout the federal state.
In order for children to start learning faster, the last year of the crisis is a rule of law - a model which, in the course of other federal states, also coincides.
Only future comparison studies can show if students' performances improve in a sustainable way.
In PISA studies in 2003, the rate of risk students decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
In total, however, Sarre has not improved as much as other federal states.
The bazaars are getting better.
And in the great challenge of sarrois, knowledge in foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - we could even get points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbor is mandatory in the Lycaes - even if the sarrois are not French.

In Venezuela, the exhibitions will soon be tic-tac rather than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will re-mount the chronometer of a half-hour in the South American country.
Chavez eventually became a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela communicated to her, as a new law, the exhibitions will be arranged at least four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country receives a timetable that is not in any other state of the world.
The former U.S. Chavez justified his position among others by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of full-time arms.
In addition, Chávez announced Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, as a matter of arrest.
The right-wing nationalist announced that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not have relations with the head of state, nor with the Government of Colombia.
"I can't do it, already only because of my dignity," said Chávez, who has a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote on Monday's referendum.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The starting point of this debate was the decision of Uribe to withdraw from Chávez the mandate for negotiations on the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "stirred to the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticized Thursday Chávez.
In Spain also Chávez is in every mouth.
A new mobile phone sound in the country: "Why don't you call" is the phrase that has already been downloaded over half a million people online.
It was pronounced by Spanish King Juan Carlos, who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was excited by the constant interpolations of the left-wing populists and who told him to stop.
A low salary threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong conjugation, according to a forecast, a real low-value of salary threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all kinds of reasons to explain their prognostic pessimism.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should expect a real reduction on their payroll for the previous year in 2007.
"The failure is due to the low wage development, to the increase in the added value of the Tax and to the amounts of food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for the Macro-Economic and Conjuncture Research, in the newspaper "Bild".
New burdens could also be involved in insurance and unemployment insurance for the employee.
The Minister for Finance Peer Steinbrück said in the newspaper "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the projected decrease in unemployment insurance of 3.3 per cent for the new year was certain to be correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be found in the embargoes to request the Federation of Credits or Financial Assistance, according to the SPD Policy.
It was Tuesday that the price explosion of food products and hydrocarbons had increased the inflation rate to its highest level for 13 years.
Overall, prices increased by 3.0 per cent from one year to another.
Venus is the hell of the Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere in life, Venus is more like the Earth than it was thought to be: the "Venus Express" European space probe has discovered light in the atmosphere and wind turbines to the pools, like those that appear in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed there are clarifications on Venus.
The "Venus Express" European probe today has shown - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: the vegetarians on Venus emit about 56 kilometres of cloud cloud, reports Christopher Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine " nature".
According to the famous cyprine theory, the lighting would have made life on Earth appear: the clock would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, a stone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If there's life there, it must have been a very old date of history," explains Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
Today there should be no shortage of living things on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times more dense than on Earth, and there are sometimes 500 degrees of temperatures.
"Venus may be the hell of Earth, but it remains a jewel," said Russell.
Why Venus, which is so much like Earth in size and size, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the key question of the ASE mission.
The beginning of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venus's research, since no probe has been on the way to explore this planet for the past four decades.
According to researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several articles of " nature" do not only highlight Venus's uniqueness within the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighbouring planet are more numerous than the first.
Thus researchers have found, in addition to the already known wind turbines in the North Pole, a cloud turbine in the southern Pole, which runs even faster.
The phenomenon reminds the air corridors in the earthquake in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni de l'Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale and Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second planet of the solar system is almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The qualified planet of stars in the evening or in the morning rotates around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns slowly on itself: one day it will last 243 days on the ground.
Although Venus, with a temperature of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, does not remember the Earth, scientists assume that the two planets are made in similar conditions.
On both sides, the water gathered and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but lost in the space on Venus.
And when carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth in the form of carbon, it is on Venus most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands the end of the party's request for Dalai Lama's reception to Chancellery.
It was indirectly critical of the SPD due to attacks against the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's appearance and is the great coalition of Closure's wish for Dalai Lama's home.
"We must not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," Köhler said at Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding of the Dalai Lama's reception by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even if I have respect for differences between cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, the President of the Federal Republic emphasized, but he defended Merkel against the criticisms that it would organise a new Chinese policy.
The German Chancellor has not taken its distance with the traditional policy of one China alone.
"China knows you too," Köhler said.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had expressed his discontent with Dalai Lama's reception and had been attacked outside the CDU's ranks.
Steinmeier was particularly concerned about the CDU's "development policy" in foreign policy.
After Dalai Lama's welcome to Chancellery, violent irritations began to appear in the German-Chinese reports.
Thus, the Chinese Government not only ordered the German Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to the information provided by Spiegel, also welcomed the dialogue on foreign ministers' strategy.
The head of the Government of China Wen Jiabao now demands German Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize that the reception of Dalai-Lama was a mistake.
China refuses that European political men receive Tibet's spiritual head in its official functions, so Wen Jiabao supported the Chinese position.
The words and deeds of Dalai Lama would show that he was trying to separate Tibet from China and other Tibetan regions, including other modern provinces.
Schäuble guard against emotes like those of France.
Street fights with the police, shootings, fire cars: Wolfgang Schäuble guard against the emotes like those of France.
All must be implemented so that social satisfaction in Germany does not spread in the streets by violence, the German Minister of the Interior has demanded.
Barcadas burning, censors shooting at the police with shooting rifles: after the heavy embers of young people in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosion does not also occur in our home and ceases to be violent.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "New Press" in Hanover.
All young individuals would not be able to get out with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the Federal States and the Communities had already worked hard to reduce the problems, says Schäuble.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"The summits of integration at the Islamic Conferences show its first success already."
But it would be too early for an end of the alert.
Schäuble notes at the same time that in the German bananas, there are no sociological problems or the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the Parisian agglomerations in the north, young people were delivered to serious street fights with the police during the last few nights.
In Toulouse too, public cars and buildings burned.
More efforts to integrate the German Government were required by the President of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
Taking into account the emoluments in France, Kolat kept against the "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
However, there would be a need to act.
Kolat highlights the fact that the unemployment rate among young people under 25 years of age above immigration would be higher than the average.
There should be more space for training first.
Korat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective."
The President of the Turkish Communities, however, added that social control in families was more important in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigration do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged: "But we must be cautious even."
It should "give young people the opportunity to participate in work and training".
While waiting, in the Parish suburbs of Villaers-le-Bel, everything remained very calm during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was operating the area with projectors.
The authorities in position made three arrests, as well as some burnt cars and villages.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1,000 security forces has brought peace.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced by the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit to Faubourg.
On Tuesday night, about 80 police officers were injured at the shootings in Villaers-le-Bel.
The next night, the trouble broke out in Toulouse.
The emotes emerged after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Park, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The utopic entry of the Chancellor shows that the coalition has finished with the background - and that there is nothing to wait for.
In which country does this chancellor live in justice?
After its disappointing intervention in the general debate of the German Parliament, which was catholic and poor, it must be said that it is not here - not in the country which should, at last, be governed by it.
The challenge of too much focus on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel by a harsh and presumptuous sentence.
It's provincial, she said and just showed that she doesn't want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, it has made it visible to all the extent to which this challenge was true.
There was neither practical interest nor strong feelings for the country's problems to be felt.
In place, Angela presents herself as a cloud: a perpetrating politician, who was in foreign policy and who even stayed in the closet.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, it is still pleased with the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how climate goals should be achieved in our country.
Even, self-reliance - having been so modest, the head of the CDU would have rejected it two years ago.
Now it collapses into formulas all the facts, that growth would affect people.
It thus destroys its pragmatist image, which solves problems instead of improvising the world.
But in the winter of Angela, internal policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty in children and underpaid workers?
He's got a few words for that.
In this regard, it reveals the number of times when she makes laps when it comes to family housing.
Here, Merkel needs three steps to pronounce a specific half-word.
She's stuck in an unknown land, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the discussion of Youtube of Republican candidates to the presidential office, the two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, are engaged in a tough battle - and now they need to fear an outside candidate.
The pressure of candidates has already fallen on the first subject.
He would have made New York a "refugee to the clandestine" challenge Mit Romney to his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This was against him by heavy accusations: "I would say that his own house was a treasure for clandestine people," Giulian answered and called on the former governor of Massachusetts to have employed immigrants without papers.
The candidates are against the attack: as the Republican base does not have any formal favors, eight candidates to the presidential office serve discussions on CNN, first of all, in order to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur films that Internet users sent via YouTube are more painful than those of fans.
"It's with this sort of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power," John McCain launched his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to claim an immediate retreat from Iraq.
Romney also makes the lesson powerful by Vietnam's Veterans, when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of questioning where the Christmas is simulated.
However, the fact that the important topics of the campaign are moving away from the war in Iraq and the discussions on torture are reflected in the reactions of the St. Petersburg joint hall in Florida.
Whether the conservative values are sold or the future amounts of taxes are refused, the awards vary in the audience.
That's where they show up once again where they live the weaknesses of the two favorites.
"I made a mistake at this time," explained Romney, and apologized to the base and the television audience to be still a party to the abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, goes into a relaxed noun when asked for his opinion on the literary interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf ruled for the first time in civil.
One day after his withdrawal as leader of the armed forces, the man of Pakistani power Musharraf was invested as president.
So eight years of military domination ends.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was invested yesterday for a new five-year mandate.
The Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony directly to the Presidential Palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf has sworn to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the United Nations.
Mercredi had handed over his army leader to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani and had thus been subjected to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after taking power by a pusch without blood, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of the civil state.
With this withdrawal from the position of commander of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf described on 3 November.
Shortly after his investment, Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Prosecutor General Malik Muhammad Qayum, and will meet another West requirement.
The Supreme Court of the country, which was occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with the judges of its ranks, had rejected all appeals against the contested re-election of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed in the tribal region of northern Waziristan in an attack against a military convoy, and four others injured.
According to the instructions of the military spokesman, a bomb exploded in a street near the Afghanistan border.
Krautrock's fathers are coming back.
The Supergroups of Germany of the 1960s react: the three members of the Harmonia Group again took their consoles in a concert in Berlin.
For their return there are records of their great success "Live 1974".
Already at that time, they were better known abroad.
The intended feeling is then produced in the form of three Masses announced at the show of the evening.
Each has his little bottle in front of him, his cable and before all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, at 63 years of age, works in a white shirt like snow.
It is spread to the left by Michael Rother, 57-year-old and with a portable computer and a guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire audience, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73 years old, is running on his console.
Everyone contributes to noise, including a Beat.
And sometimes this adds to an alarming lack of traditional music.
This does not seem to be too much for mercenaries themselves.
The fact that the Harmonia group replayed some of Krautrock's amateurs made sure that some of them were married again.
We have the right to throw it out here: targeted surveys show that, of course, the name is reasonable in the collective memory of the pop, but in no way is so durable that this group has been in pain for 32 years.
But why wouldn't Germany also have the right to celebrate its live legends in the 1960s?
More and more than what is commonly called "Krautrock" has become more and more in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry discovered Echo's prize to the Survivors of the Cologne Can Group for their work in 2003, the German pop interviewers were seen in the room.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the Panegic Elegance, the surprise had no more limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother saluted on the scene of Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of homelessness and transfiguration in the unknown is the only and the only one.
The memory is of this fact already taken by Harmonia, because the trio has only existed for two years and that during this period, the impact power felt was much lower than what was then assigned to it by others.
Moebius and Rodelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We play first in the cabins below the Berlinian scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had recently settled in Kraftwerk and was finally named as a guitarist with Neu!, who was at the time perhaps the most radical German group.
By 1973, however, he was following the musicians of Cluster in exile in the Weserbergland forests.
There, in an old Weser farm, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Ideologically less than in the "Common I" community, where Roedelius had the right to torture himself as a nurse.
A rather artistic existence like Spitzeg.
A fan of the Coral Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for the art was found in the powder.
Most of the time, harmony is far away from that.
The first album is called "Music von Harmonia", and the following is "De Luxe".
Because also serene and modicic music, the group suffered material misery.
The harvest of the dead tree did not serve alone in self-search.
The "Live 1974" CD that appeared was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a public record of almost 50 heads, as well as some thought to be remembered.
Rother was released at the time, and he wanted to force Harmonia to train himself from time to time.
It was an immoral requirement for Rodelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother atterrit in the spheres of esotericism and ensures his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen" (Flamming Hearts).
Cluster is re-initiated in the twenty-four years and has been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
We have the live album of Griessem in Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Grönland has set the goal of maintaining Krautrock as an independent German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been destroyed on this occasion as Roedelius's personal work.
Harmonia's physical resurrection took place at the World's Cultural House in Berlin.
Publicly subsidised, in the framework of the Woodtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, old punk and author of the booklet "Krautrick Sampler".
There is also the inventor of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire flow margin of the influence of Krautrock would be marked with respect to future pop music.
The empty space left by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's phrase is in the living room in the middle of his single voice: "The only true music, you listen to the future."
There are photos showing producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white images of tool cabled in baser serve to train the legend.
First, the three veterans are again busy in improvising.
But more by collecting microphones into the ear and battery, to take off the instrument of soundless sounds through self-contained instruments.
Today, electronic music is like electronic music.
The three in large technical finers.
At the same time, there's nothing going to change the home's choral.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we are all excited and excited under the cloud of sound, and we sing at a beautiful moment "Aaaaaaaah" with an emphase.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
He's never been a rocker.
The roots were less searched in the blue than in the music conservatories (Can), in the technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the output of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who creates "68" is not entirely wrong, and also Harmonia is no longer allowed to get upset by it now.
But what goes most of it will be covered in minutes on stage.
Where does music begin and where does it end?
It can fall on the nerves of someone (?) or give away away moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is not just a cynic.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Death Peace", two films re-examine the war of the Balkans.
But they both don't agree.
Either the projects are too much on the action and on the exchanges of insensitized shots or, on the contrary, they are too alarming.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: some Karadzic and Mladic war criminals are always hiding in the Balkans mountains, but it is just there, in the backmost countries the most brutal of Bosnia's war, that actor Richard Gere was then found.
We had recently lost sight of the most beautiful man in the 20s, because too many nice and fun roles in women's feelings movies and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism have aroused his desire to show himself.
Today, Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at when even "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes shot (Why should today's films be as long and confused as collective conventions of locomative drivers?)
He gives a great representation full of eyes: in the main, his reputation as war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the fate and industry of the films were not so welcome: a man who has his best moments since behind him, but who, even as a monument in ruins at his descent, has kept sight of the remains of his former charm.
In spite of this, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Death peace", which also came this week, the endless follow-up of films on the Balkans war.
"Death peace" can be quickly done: the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serb of Kosovar French-thirs, in which one of the two still falls quickly in love.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs here are not once presented as the only causes of all evils, this film also spreads that a TV film is losing too fast in the action and the exchanges of insensible shots.
This remains a sort of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without driving but with a war in place.
On the contrary, we can look at the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", because there has never really been a real film on the war of the Balkans.
The story of the three U.S. war reporters, who are in a position to strike the high criminal of war "the return", could have become, with another realist and another scenarioist (both Richard Shepard), at another time, a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories look like a surprise: two men go into the woods to do something that soldiers can't do, and for the two men, that becomes a trip in the mud.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we just don't let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynic with a heart, as we are presented at the beginning.
No, the script must assign it to extend a romantic adventure with a Bosniak then murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad when reporting it, in the space of the last five minutes, by an accelerated procedure, results in the failure of NATO, the CIA and all the world's prize hunters in five years: to catch the war criminal and leave it for a fair vengeance to the Muslims.
It is so bad that the International Court of Justice of the Hague should be prosecuted against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has too much human concern.
He wants to claim that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects Americans and French (they must be extremely agreed) that they do not lead the chaos in an intensive manner due to secret political agreements.
But the intended good and the evil are this time so similar that a famous poem of Brecht comes to our mind.
He speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the table of work of the poet: "Compassing, I see the veins of the grunfled front, clearly: how tired it is to be evil."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such dark heads, but those who ignore what it's hard to be good.
The problem is not limited to the sort of films on the Balkans war.
Recently, it was reported in this journal that all Hollywood films on Iraq were large flups.
We can add: there have never been good films on South Africa yet.
What is worth every time: when a star trains on a crisis shelter or on a mine field, he succeeds in doing something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arkette, "Jenseits go to Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are just too close in time.
Whatever it is, decades have always passed before Hollywood can turn a good movie on the Holocaust with "The Schindler List".
Some films must still be mutilated - those who today use classical works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have never been celebrated together at their time as executives.
But maybe we know today too much about the world's conflicts, where each hecatomb comes directly on two screens at the same time at home,
And this angers the scanners for the lack of sculptures they need to tell us good stories.
"Be or not" or "The dictator" have actually become so good because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know what point the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
It may be necessary to have the artistic view of sarcastics and distance from Romance Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historic novel "Dictionnaire de Lemprière" and the war of the Balkans, he replied, "This has nothing to do with the fact that some things never change."
"The big cities will always be terriblely dangerous, men will always be killed in a horrible way and war will always rule in Yugoslavia."
Von Beaust collects criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The capture of the mayor with Hamburg's candidate for the Summer Olympics has resulted in the policy and economy of critical virulents.
Many want to continue fighting for the Games on the waterboard.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of opportunities.
The principal director of the Chamber of Commerce of Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a resignation as "missing for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project has deployed as much motivation in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this objective, the political-sporting elite could not be maintained in the same measure."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new starting point in the longer term, "which takes as a starting point another modified agenda".
The Mayor Ole von Beust has remained faithful to his previous statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg who decides a candidate for the Olympics, but the German Federation of Olympics," said Von Beaust at WELT Online.
It refers to the expected decision of the Federation of Sports in December on Munich's application for winter games in 2018.
This preference means for us, that, in the period of time that we had planned until 2028 until then, we will have no chance."
However, the dream does not definitely belong to the past, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
The impression would be that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to stop an opportunity by doing the projects now," said HSB President Günter Ploß.
A withdrawal of the application would be further contrary to the statements made by the Head of the Senate at the time of the full meeting of the German Federation of higher schools in sport.
Below, Von Beust would have qualified Hamburg's application to the 2015 universities as "no substitute" for the Olympics in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Schools of Sport was first appointed as a candidate city in the past weeks named Hamburg.
The SPD section of the mayor told the Senate not to use this precious time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Small Grasbrook has been rejected by the Senate for years because it has played the map of the Olympics and has excluded the construction of dwellings," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always claimed for the Small Grasbrook an integrated plan in the Olympics and subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have placed exclusively on the "Event factor".
The 2012 Summer Olympics candidacy would have a great enthusiasm for its part in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg had broken against Leipzig.
It's not the Warhols caches.
The one who links Swedish concepts and falls into wood, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast shadows on the Warhol's work list.
A large part of the twenty-four Brillo-Boxs of "Type Stockholm" listed below are contradictions.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned a few months ago the authenticity of the British Boxes of 1968 by Andy Warhol, the internal research of the Moderna Museum of Stockholm today leads to a disappointing result: the six Brillo-Boxes, the former director of the bridge Pontis Hulten in 1995 at the Moderna Museum, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundred Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm", which are traveling on the international art market.
The ancient history is covered, a deconcerting presentation of artistic and curative products.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Bryllo-Boxes" in New York, which is based on the red-blue-white design of the "Brillo" soap cartons.
A exhibition of his work at Moderna Museet was presented in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - of hundreds of Brillo cartons made of cardboard: They did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It was not about art works here, but rather about their models, exhibition examples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wood caches in Sweden, which were not yet exposed to Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of today speak of about fifteen wooden boxes that would then be legalized in the history of art and castles, as the original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol authorized, with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have reached sales of over $100,000.
The problem is now that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum, however, later claimed that about a hundred wooden caches had been produced and exposed in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol had then been awarded.
In fact, 105 Hultén caches were produced in Malmö only in 1990, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, director of Moderna Museet, examined, along with six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three other Swedish private collections, of which two were made in Stockholm in 1968: their stratified panels were first printed and printed, then applied with a paint brush in white oil.
The text of copies dating from 1990 reveals that the painting was directly applied to the stratified panels, using a painting roll - it is no longer a oil painting, but an acrylic.
"These cases have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes," said the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York no further decision has been made, the Moderna Museet will class the six cases in its collection as copies/exposure material."
Already in July, the Board's Authentication announced that it would investigate the "hard charges" that will be raised in the case of powdered soap boxes.
But since we've been there, we've had an inexorable silence.
Manille's Rebellious Soldiers Give Up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers leave, the same ones who have been withdrawn from a hotel in Manila, and who have demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who appealed to the President for corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not respond to any blood flow.
Faithful soldiers in power had not before taken over the hotel with the help of lacrymogen gas.
The twelve soldiers had been dragged away for hours in the building.
About half of them were held in custody before the courts because of a failed pusch attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He uses the audience to sneak out suddenly with about 30 sympathies.
The military police, who normally had to monitor them, appeared to have been deserted in favor of him and joined in his office.
They entered the Penisula Hotel and requested the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The loyal forces in power blocked the sector around the hotel.
The President held an urgent meeting of the Security Bureau.
The National Security Council, Norberto Gonzales, condemned military action.
"People have enough," Trillanes said.
"We call people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who had run before the Scouts Rangers elite unit, said that other units of the army wanted to join in the course shortly.
The criticisms of the regime had called for a great demonstration against the President of the Mercedi.
Its government has been surrounded for months by threats of corruption.
Manille's financial district has already been the theater of some 200 members of the army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurrection is broken almost 24 hours after the army refuses to join it.
Since 1986 there have already been at least seven attempts by Putsch against governments democratically elected in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes the main shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has ensured more than 20 percent of Versatel's telecommunications company.
The average price per action is EUR 14,46, as the company reported.
Only 20.05 per cent of the social capital would be held.
We've already been sped up on a rocket before.
The option would remain open to increase participation in Versatel.
With this not to speed up the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet communicated.
Just before, assumptions had already been made regarding an entry, after the Berenberg Bank increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 per cent to 15.1 per cent.
The credit institution would only hold the money for a third party, which is reported on the market.
The Watch, United Internet had already acquired a 10 percent share in Drillish mobile phone company.
As part of an increase in capital, Drillish put in Exchange 17.4 million new shares of EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet has purchased 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL products and mobile telephone.
"We strengthen our partnership," explained a United Internet spokesman.
The two companies founded the MSP participating company to absorb Freenet’s competitor.
At the moment, the two companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent share in Freenet, and do not use their right to invest 18,49 percent more in Freenet, trusted the United Internet Thursday.
However, both companies would leave all open options, especially increasing participation in SA Freenet, have been learned.
The United Internet and Freenet negotiations on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
The poker still difficult to predict on Freenet which lasts for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2.9 million clients connected with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL clients and full subscriptions.
The United Internet and Drillish Holding has so far held a direct participation in Freenet of 6.01 per cent.
It was now agreed that Drillish would bring about four percent additional.
The right to purchase 18,49 per cent of the Vatas investment company had already been decided in August.
