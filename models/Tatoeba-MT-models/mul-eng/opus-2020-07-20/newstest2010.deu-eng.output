Barack Obama receives the peace Nobel Prize as the fourth US President
American President Barack Obama will come to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to take the price of peace as the fourth US President in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medals and a check of $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House will arrive tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the Norwegian Metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he makes a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five members who have chosen him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The presidential couple then arranged a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
The next day, the visit will reach its peak with the ceremony, where Obama takes over the prize price.
He receives this as the fourth US President, but only as the third one who takes the price directly from the office.
The White House has already warned that Obama will speak at the price of the Afghan war.
The President does not want to raise this issue because he knows that he will take the price as a president who will lead the war in two countries at the time of the war.
The war efforts have been strengthened a few days ago by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which none of its critics forgot to mention.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the gold medals, the diploma and the check over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to spend money for well-being purposes, but he has not yet decided on a specific characteristic work.
The event programme then proposes a banquet with the President and his wife, where the Prime Minister and 250 other guests are also present outside Norway's King and Queen.
From the beginning, Obama was very opposed to the price.
For example, he pointed out that he felt that he didn't deserve the price at all.
Several times he also repeated that the price is not only for him, but for all those who want the same values as he wants.
Immediately after the announcement, he pointed out that this was a "demand for action" for him.
Natural protection is charged with the repression
The Leitmeritz Police accused the presidents of the Civil Protection Community Leitmeritz because of oppression.
In several cases, in the past year, he filed professions against some construction procedures, and for the recovery of his profession, he asked the investors for money for his goods, said the leader of the police, Alena Romova.
The president of the Leitmeritz Nature Protection Community, Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in jail and he's been sentenced to three years in prison.
The sorting mill container in brünn doesn't smell good
In Prague, people can sort the drinking packages, in the South Sea resorts you will find the sorter-mul-container again and again.
And in Brünn?
There you had to book a few minutes to find the suitable molltons.
I do not want to claim that waste collection would not work at all.
But I wonder if the radicals are not concerned enough about this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brinn is located in the waste stream in the Urwaldlaga, not only because we as citizens can always provide only paper, glass and plastics in the sorting container, but especially by the number of multons for such wastes.
Have they ever tried to remove PET bottles in a collection basket, for example?
It's an art, especially it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I've found casually so far is the market place against the wounded gans.
Mr Onderka should not be proud of his colleagues, but that is too little for me.
In addition to the fact that waste collection is not honey in other parts of the world.
That's why all the rows of my friends don't even sort the waste out.
Out of loyalty.
It's too far for them to go to the multons.
I'm not surprised.
I have offered myself after the party to remove a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on the Konicova Street, I have seen no color mulchtons in sight.
Fortunately, I arrived on the road to the right place.
But the powder loved almost over.
But that's still the center of Brünn, which represents the whole city, isn't it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetic are likely to call the brüner socialists.
They prefer to buy the city an Eishockeylagi, which makes us suffer throughout the Republic, rather than buy a few multons more and offer the sort of other raw materials for a cleaner source.
I'm glad I could confirm my acceptance with official statistics after I've been looking for a long time on the Internet.
According to the data provided by the ECO-COM company, Brünn is indeed the worst in the entire South Sea region.
The Paroubek budget has taken away the money for pensions and sickness.
After the left party, despite the government's view of farmers and officials, no money is available in the budget for rent, sickness and construction.
But not for public servants or for the international court.
This causes even more problems that will be in the government in the second half of the next year, says Finance Minister Edward Janata.
When social Democrats and Communists have spent the money raising for some groups, they calculated that the government would spend more money on the emotional expenditure, pensions or on the quality of the disease. "This is just an increase in the problems in the future, mining," says Janata.
Credits pay considerably higher interest rates, and money needs to be restored at some point.
Too much to choose, why the state cache is empty.
If social services or costs are not reduced for the state operation, the taxes shall be increased.
For all those who now gave the left party more money: the fireworks, the teachers, the farmers.
And later on for their children.
In order to eliminate the interest or disease from their account 1.8 billion people need no fear, they get this money.
But in terms of the price that the State owes itself even more - in the next year, not only 163 billion dollars will be lost in the state fund, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janato, the apology will grow faster and with these also costs and benefits.
The state will need the money for the balance, then it will no longer be sufficient to increase VAT only slightly or to cut the maternity money as the government did in its face-fixed package.
As a result of money laundering in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will also be needed in the coming year for the development of cars and railways.
It is too much about the sections won in the competition that cannot be redesigned and redesigned, if any.
They get the highest, which is not even free.
This means neglecting or setting up thirty large construction works, which is also threatened by the creation of Europe, warns the speaker of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solve the flow of money in salmonically - it attacks the CEZ activists where the state is owned by the majority, and from which the money will be protected in the transport fund.
The problem is that the height of the dividend is never safe and it's not always an infinite source.
In the last year, CEZ 18 billion was released into the budget.
Each year, the dividends will pay the environmental damage payments, the pension account will be filled and this money will also serve as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
In addition to this trend, the actual budget deficit at the level of 5.7 per cent of GDP is in line with EU rules.
However, this does not end the carnival of the fluctuations.
Nearly three billion pay the budget for various damages to the victims of communism and punishments or for the use of the judiciary, even for the construction of buildings.
If the state comes without this money, it's not safe.
It's a good luck game.
If we lose an international court war, we must pay it as well, Janata is clear.
The Minister will then have to save the resources or attack the government's bidder.
One hundred million are also missing for the two billion-year-old project "State Fund", which should enable the individual authorities to monitor on-line what the money is spent on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find the money elsewhere, the project had to be stopped and sanctions would be imposed, Janata warned.
Your next smartphone will manage two operating systems
The Americans plan for the future with a phone that allows the user to switch between different operating systems by pressing a single key.
The proposed plans look promising.
It's enough to press just one key, and from Windows Mobile it's going to be in less than a second in the Android exchange.
This is exactly the opportunity for the American company VMware, which focuses primarily on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles at the same time on the phone.
You can switch between these, you can separate these into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, stated Srinivas Krishnamurti from the company VMware at the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in the last year of November and was introduced for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of Smart Phones is not a fiction.
VMware successfully introduced the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM storage, at the same time running the aforementioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full practice.
The VMware company is now working with European and American operators on smartphone virtualisation and is expected to come to the customer within 2012.
The hotel's owner holds a short walk on the mountains.
Sleeveless tracks don't just worry about the residents of the Riegenge Mountains.
The missing snow also attracts people from ordering skiing in hotels and pensions.
That is why you can still get free rooms for all winter terms incl. Christmas and Easter.
Our pages are often visited.
People go through the offers, fix the prices, but among them they are afraid to order binding orders.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if our opinion is to be on snow or "on matsch" after this year's Christmas party, the information sports operator Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, asked.
Anyone who wants the silver-silvester suspension in the spindelmülmüll is exactly following his suggestions should no longer hesitate with the order.
Anyone who prefers saving and who only comes to second place to the quality of the stay can try to wait a few days.
The spindelmülmül hotel owners offer mainly weekly meals for the day of the silvester.
I think they'll try to sell them for a while, but then they'll have to follow, and they'll have to go in for a while.
And then the free rooms will be cleared quickly, dear Jandura.
Free beds in all winters also always offer the Travel Office Intours in Vrchlabi.
Now most of us are interested in the Christmas week that has not yet been sold.
In our offer, about half of the places are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some more expensive Christmas holidays for the last moment, led by the director of the Travel Office Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Silver Day in Rieggengen mountains can also offer the Vrchlabi Travel Office, but there are less free places here.
Good paragraph also finds the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter terms are sold averagely.
In this year, the interest in winter stay is also adversely affected by the fact that there is always no snow in the Riegenge mountains.
People wait for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the year in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks are broken within a week, the Christmas will also be sold, i.e. skifert.
Turn around and something better than in the last year it is possible to own the rooms in the hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We're about five percent better than last year.
On Saturday and Christmas, we have just a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in January, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The Omnia Hotel is also located at the central park in Janske Lazne.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain free on Christmas nights at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne.
In January of this year, we were surprised to see about 60 per cent of us at the time.
A bit weaker is between February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in the stay in the Riegenge Mountains is also increasing, led by the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
On a larger snowfall, the Riegengeberg hotel owners wait between them.
On Thursday it should rest and if it comes down, it should be snow on the mountains.
But then again, Jiri Jakubsky informed the Czech Weather Agency of the location in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repeating is the mother of courage
It is almost comical, with which student diligence Barack Obama, the president, with his call from the complainant, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghan question, which he himself held for the stupidest.
When he finally expelled his suspected Afghan doctor, it showed that he had written this over the copy paper from the Bush-Iraq scenario for three years.
Not only that he used the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Forward Path" without saying.
Three years ago, he himself criticized the Bush idea - fresh troop quotas in Iraq, which was hit by the civil war - as a "unresponsive and charistrophic decision".
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, which is based on the recommendations of the military, was the only possible and thus very successful that today in the news about Iraq, it is no longer possible to speak.
The noise Bush was not improved by this, because he objectively left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than it was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barak Obama hopes that the miracle will continue.
In order to stop the troop contingent, the military again asked him, in particular the commander of the Afghan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordination custom, strongly criticized the harmful protections in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to be able to turn the situation into a better one.
The President delayed three months, but he did not come up with a better idea, and he wanted to help the General with 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has printed the pledge for another 5,000, even though he has originally calculated at least 10,000.
The biggest problem with the entire Obama strategy is its intention to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to complete this process within three years. The entire Obama doctor is leaving more questions than answers.
Some doubt that half the rise will have the same effect as the measures in Iraq.
Despite the brotherly war in recent years, Iraq's society has been structured relatively well, and its leaders have respected the values.
The Afghan situation is caused by the counter-indication - no one can leave and no agreements will be held.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are accustomed to change their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even if they have been formally founded, will only continue to be able to build rails, which will further increase the patriarchal tribal ties.
The difference between the different ethnic groups is uncommonly complicated, especially because of the uncertainty of the relationship that continues to worsen the influence of Pakistan and Iran.
The creation of a "tradable State", which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time zone of Obama's strategy promoted by its volunteerism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and is now at the edge of the explosion.
They believe that the small soldiers who have been thrown into the war row over the "Morning" can only create a miracle here, a really romantic soul that can't be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date set for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible because the Taliban will assume it as the indirect state of the American Netherlands.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the Europeans to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is on the decline.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the safety of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindu Mountains.
Another possible factor that can influence the situation radically is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on Iran do not work out, a very serious question arises for the United States whether the problem is not to be solved by troops.
This question must be answered during the period in which Obama wrote for victory from Afghanistan in the Americas.
However, each solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only trust bottle for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years to the presidential election and therefore there is still enough time for it to reach another strategy, if it were to be a total case.
The manager of the Bank Goldman Sachs won't get a prize bonus anymore in bar
The leading executives of the American Bank Goldman Sachs won't receive a prize bonus this year anymore.
This was announced by the company that responded to the sharp criticism of its pay practices.
A group of 30 top managers is obtained instead of the cash shares, which can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn from the managers in the event of excessive risk.
Goldman Sachs, according to the Reuters agency, puts himself at the top of the efforts to connect the Wall Street Premieeboni with long-term performance.
I think the Wall Street is aware of the direction it has to go, led by the former banker of the JPMorgan company, Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of the criticism after she had spent nearly 17 billion dollars for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of the premiumboni over the course of this year is likely to exceed 20 billion dollars, despite the measures presented today.
The high premiums in the banking sector have become the biggest political issue in a number of countries at the beginning of the financial crisis.
The United Kingdom reported on Wednesday that it was intended to charge the banker's bonus, which exceeds $25,000, with a tax rate of 50 per cent.
Similar steps are being taken by France.
In this year, women have won the Nobel Prize in all news, except in physics.
Five record women today in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustav took this year's Nobel Prize in the fields and for literature.
In addition to the four scientists, the German author of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has received two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their Landsmann Jack Szostak for research in the chromosone field.
The price for Chemistry has been received by Israel's Ada Jonathan along with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for clarification of the Ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureatin gave the Nobel Prize for Economics, which American Elinor Ostrom and her Landsmann Oliver Williamson had received for analysis of the economic report.
The only professional category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao for research in the glass phaser area and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for CCD chip detection, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax devices or astronomical remotes.
Each of these awards has received the diploma, the Nobel laureate and the certificate of the acquisition of the prize.
It consists of ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are multiple awards in each category, the price of the money will be divided below it.
According to tradition, American President Barak Obama has received the most expected peace Nobel Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged the contradictions of his appointment because he was only at the beginning of his journey, and in addition, he stands at the top of the country, which leads two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations for the fight against world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janatoto looks forward to his return. Klaus invited him to the castle.
President Vaclav Klaus receives the Minister of Finance, Edward Janato, who thinks about his stay in the government on Friday, because he is not in agreement with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form that he was released by the Assembly on Wednesday.
It is accepted that the budget and perhaps the stay of Janata in the cabinet will be the subject of the Friday event.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the state deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The President-in-Office, Radim Okvat, informed the meeting.
About his further stay in his function, Janata wants to negotiate with the Premier, Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget rule, which is now signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should have a deficit of 163 billion dollars.
In Parliament, however, on Wednesday, the Left Party proposals for money laundering were approved and the money increased for state officials, for the maintenance of the social services and direct payments of farmers.
The Government has opposed the proposals of social democracy that it covers the budget deficit.
Between the left party on the one hand and the government, the class and the right party on the other, a more sharp internal political dispute arose, thus raising the questionnaire on the further work of the Fisheries Agency, which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed in the morning.
Critics argued that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, would practically liquidate the package of savings taken by the fisheries government in the autumn, and that, according to their understanding, the State debt should be terminated.
Claus, who can sign the law on the state budget, but he does not have to explain today's debate morning with the entrepreneurs that politicians have been wasting their time on the "sustainable deficit" of public finances.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government that could build on a wider consensus of political parties.
The ODS president, Mirek Topolanek, pointed out that the budget is generous, and the government should consider its further existence.
The ODS chairperson, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the office office with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party is obviously no longer functioning.
Premier Fischer referred to similar words in the edition as "strong claims".
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek statement that the state deficit was serious that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year and exceeded the 200 billion dollars.
Already Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claimed that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unattached" of the world shows much from the country, its fight and victory despite some criticisms that the main role was being played by an American actor.
The story tells about sports, racial relations and about Nelson Mandela.
The relentless fight against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is in his life story of the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the nine-year-old Mandela to show him in the Eastwood film.
Another significant role is taken by Matt Damon.
I told him, "When I play you, I have to meet you.
The two-year-old actor who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the "Million Dollar Baby" box was already the leader of the movement to get rid of the slave, from which he has become a slave holder, a strong president of the United States, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but only rarely someone who lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African stateman was in prison for his active activity in completing the apartheid in the South African Republic for 27 years.
He was set free in 1990 and for four years he was president of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unblocked", and at the same time is the name of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The demand was how to speak
The film portrays a real event in which Nelson Mandela, together with the captain of the South African Red Cross, Francois Pienaar, has been united in order to unite the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people are still racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can give his people some through the sport, so he decides to join the rupture players that belong to the outside world.
Finally, the South African team rose to the world Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring Mandela's history to the quinoleinwad.
He had no other goal than to play this role as far as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to speak as he did.
The actor said that if he and the politicians were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela to eat with him at night and to be behind the scenes in front of him.
The most important thing was for him to shake Mandela's hand.
I've determined that if I shake your hand, I take your energy, she'll be transferred, and I had the feeling that I know how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to be another person.
Matt Damon is in the film François Pienaar, the captain of the national football team, in which the white players have reviewed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hardy world.
It was a great surprise for him when he first met pienaar in his house.
I remember listening to the Turklingel that he opened up and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: 'In the film I look much larger'.
Despite the obvious differences in the actor's structure compared to their actual models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of the Director Eastwood "Invictus: Uncovered" and also speaks of views on an Oscar.
The film critic of the Dayly Variety, Todd McCarthy, concluded his assessment in the following words: "That was a very good story, very well executed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages redtoes.com, Invictus received 76% positive reviews.
Light mystery solved via Norway: The Russians tested a rocket
In Norway a special light effect was observed from an unknown source.
The Russian Ministry of Defence pointed out yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
However, the start was not successful again and the rockets that were originally supposed to be the backbone of the Russian army type "Bulava" will soon be the alpha of the Russian generality as well as the prime minister Vladimir Putin.
Nor did his repeated presence at the rocket test have a positive effect on the success of the tests.
Bulava has not been started at all or was damaged in the air.
In Russian newspapers it is already written about "Bulava" as a rocket that doesn't fly."
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This is already 13. Try, normal at the beginning.
Once again, technical damages have occurred on the rockets.
The engine probably exploded in the third rocket level.
This time, "Bulava" began from the atomic-U-boat Dmitrij Donskij, which sailed under the waters of the White Sea.
This rocket type enables the board from the U-boat.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an uncertain flying object was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that it is a Russian rocket.
On this occasion, the generality has maintained itself and claimed that it is not possible to speak clearly of a failure.
The first two levels of rockets do not fall apart and the third level was affected by the accident.
In the previous cases the engines were also damaged at the first level.
Even if no test start has been made without error, the Ministry of Defence's leadership is limited to six out of thirty.
The almost fifty percent success is therefore achieved by generality with optimism, and it is still claimed that the "Bulava" will once fly without problems and even ten hypershell atom bombs will be carried with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary fetisov signed an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow at 51 years of age.
The legendary opponent Vjaceslav Fetisov is again in a professional-eishockey game with 51 years.
The former world master, Olympics and Stanley Cup holder assists his team CSKA Moskau in the need, and it is probably already in the KHL range against Petersburg.
Fatisov, who finished his career in 1998 with fourteen years, is currently President of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas was injured, we urgently need another opponent.
Fatisov has been trained regularly and agreed to support the team.
We only need to clarify a few other formalities, the AP agency invited the coach of the Moscow Club by Sergej Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous Eishockey player is only about a game.
I think Fatisov is one of those who can affect the moral of other players, leading players Nemcinov up.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice floor, he will follow the AP of the oldest Russian professional iceckey game.
In the NHL, the legendary Stürmer Gordie Howe has played a whole season for Hartford for 18 years and was able to write 15 hits and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful Eishockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven World Championships and also triumphed in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected success in the NHL, where he twice took Stanley Cup over the head in Detroit.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the Eishockey Star Room.
Hyundai gave the trade unions back. All over the hour will be raised
The business management of the Nosovice Automotive Factory Hyundai agreed with the company on the suspension of all hours.
Because of frequent scheduled hours, the company has announced the strike preparation on Monday.
This was confirmed by the talk by the car manufacturer Hyundai, Petr Vanek.
However, the business management wants to share with the trade unions a Saturday evening this week.
We must not present our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, 19 December, voluntary overtime was proposed on the ground that two workshops would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered 400 CZK a bonus to employees who would work on Saturday.
They will also be received by the staff in the afternoon for the Saturday session of 28 November.
Vanek then decided to change the motivation of the staff for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime fee or they can take a vacation on 28 December and extend the Christmas holiday, Vanek took up.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday camp will be paid the fare and the average.
In view of the fact that the hours of the most urgent and burning point in relation to the demands and complaints of the trader which had imposed the production last week, the business administration decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the suspension of all the hours for the month of December, Vaník made a decision.
The staff of the car factory had been forced to work almost every day after the eight-hour shift for more than 2 hours.
From the signing of the Agreement, the string preparation has been withdrawn from the trade unions.
Further negotiations between the driving industry and the trade unions should be held on Friday afternoon.
The trade leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that, if they can sign up to the requirements and sign a common document, they would be ready to raise the alert.
The situation in the car factory has increased last week, on Wednesday, as about 400 workers spontan spread because of constant overhours.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and alleged fraud.
However, the business management held that employees must make the hours spent in keeping with the car delivery requirement.
The trade unions also requested that no sanctions be imposed on workers who had interrupted production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, trade unions are asked to reduce overtime to a minimum.
In addition, in this year, they demand the payment of 5000 kroner.
The Nosovice Automobile Factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
The series production was started in the company in November last year.
Up to this September, some 80,000 vehicles were manufactured, which currently accounts for 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also affects HIV virus
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new links that should link the spread of HIV viruses to the organization.
The main benefit of the improved substance is that it also works with viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
The fact is that the association with normal viral variants is not as strong as one of the medicines already available.
The AIDS disease cannot be healed yet.
Patients may, however, prolong their life and prevent the increase in HIV virus in the body.
However, its intake is accompanied by a whole range of side effects.
In addition, incomplete stress of the virus measurement has resulted in the development of sg. resistance viruses, which are no longer effective against the drugs.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way for replacing the virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances referred to as metalocarbons are active in the toxic substance responsible for the addition of HIV virus.
Metalcarbons are compounds of dust, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus measurement in other ways than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, scientists obtained new 'improved' links that were prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding on the virus.
Metal carbones have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multiphase caps consisting of hydrocarbons, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are combined by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Domestic and permanent virus
HIV-protease is an essential element of the HIV virus, which is indispensable for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV-virus column caused by HIV-protease, there would be no large infection particles.
When we turn off the HIV protease, we also turn off the virus in the patient's body, explain the scientists in the press report issued by the Institute for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe the entire series of connections in which two pairs of purchases (see tables) are linked by a short organic chain that is then systematically modified.
Something weaker, but more reliable.
The effect of this series of substances on HIV protease was tested in the Reagen glass, as well as their constant (resistant) variants that were obtained by HIV infected patients.
The effect of metalocarbons on the normal enzyme variants is not as strong as in the clinical drug use, but they do not lose their effect on the resistance inhibitors, against which the medicines used are often useless.
The unique effectiveness mechanism as well as its other characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical creation, makes the metalocarbons interesting for further research on the development of effective anti-HIV drugs, says Pavlina Rezacova, director of the laboratory for structural biology of the institutes for organic chemistry and biochemistry and of the institute for molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Battle for the budget. ODS went off to Fischer, who turns around.
The president of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, referred to the approved budget for the next year as "grainful" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should pass his opinion on their further existence.
The speaker of the ODS referred to the Prime Minister as "strong challenges".
It's probably time for the analysis.
The representative of ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the branch office, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party, is obviously no longer functioning.
After Necas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether he intends to support the minority in Parliament when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether he is going to stay in Parliament's office with the help of the links.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problems of public deficits is different in diameter, as Necas pointed out.
Parliament adopted the budget for the year 2010 on Wednesday, but with Left Party amendments more than 12 billion dollars.
Parliament has increased the money for state officials, for the maintenance of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The Government has opposed the proposals of social democracy to increase its budgetary deficit.
Chechnya should have an economic backlog of 163 billion dollars.
The ODS has left the hall before the vote, so it has followed the government's desire, as the amended budget is only a small version of the budget provisionary. Frase not clear
Disillusionment and insensibility
Minister of Finance, Edward Janata, spoke of his disappointment and a feeling of worthlessness, although Prime Minister Jan Fischer pointed out that the government is still considering the present situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janata were seriously threatened with his return to the case, the amendments would be accepted, the situation would be different.
According to the Czech TV, Janata reported on Monday after the government business at the Premier.
He indicated that he was superior to his further stay in the office.
That is why he is disappointed with the budget's interpretation.
In the meantime, fishermen have argued for the further fight against the budgetary deficit, so that according to Necas, social democracy (CSDD) nominists who had made the changes in the budget have done nothing in the government.
The Premier should also make it clear that he will come back if Parliament continues to adopt defisit-increasing laws, such as those relating to sickness and interest rates or to services laws.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS are not upset
That's the case of the Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by ODS have not made a mistake, Topolanek raised a text message from the United States.
It has been mentioned that in some ministries, people who are recognised as TOP 09 who voted against the budget are in a position to be represented.
Necas stressed that if fishermen decide to ignore the fight against deficits in the public finances, "it is entirely logical and correct that they are on the left side of Parliament."
Then he can't count on the support and tolerance of the citizens.
I have not thought about it, and if this is happening, then I will deal with it, said Minister for Defence appointed by the Democrats Martin Bartak to the journalists in Parliament.
At the European Council's meeting in Brussels, Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels every afternoon.
ODS returns to the wish of the primer
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote in Parliament on the midweek against the amended budget, if the Premier specifically asked the Members of the Democrats to allow them to adopt the budget.
We do not expect to be children of widow, we are not small children, so he then answered the question whether the ODS was not stressed in the political debate on the budget by the absence of the president of Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I didn't notice that my voice would be missing.
As soon as I forgot the mandate, I knew that in the next few months, in particular, it would go to the Bolsheviks of Parliament and to the destruction of all the positives, Topolanek himself reacted.
Following the new road plan of the CD (Czech Railways), less trains will be driven for about the same train price.
The Czech railway is completed or restricted from 13 December, but some smaller speed and local trains, other connections are strengthened.
The total volume of transport will be reduced by two per cent from the day of validity of the new roadmap compared to today.
Most prices incl. basic and customer fares will not be changed.
Several connection options in the main city include, for example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, which sets the railway for this route train of the Pendolino type.
The train will no longer be driven to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less fast trains are also driving on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, essentially reducing the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad.
The largest reduction is the railways in the Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz) region, totaling about eight percent, can rejoice at an increase in Prague and the environment.
Two nights will also be up on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis track and on some days a few weeks the operation of some fast trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis track will be reduced.
The biggest changes include the introduction of the new road from Milovice to Prague, while the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa to Labem have to move.
It is about the fifteenth road of the Esko front traffic system, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The distance to the main city will end in the target station Prague - main train station.
The CD will guide more links SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Supermerk/Jesenik will be driven within two hours.
With the pendolino, the passengers can no longer travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's account for regional rail: increase of 200 million
The fast-tracks are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, in total, the railways are received to compare the so-called liquidity loss in the next year of the next four billion dollars, as well as in this year. Local trains provide the areas, totalling eight billion dollars for them in the next year, where the state holds three billion.
In this year the regional trains are worth 200 million Czech crowns.
For local trains and fast trains, the railway has renewed a ten-year contract until now the contract has been concluded only for one year.
The railway commends the system, perhaps because it has not reached a price increase in the large majority of the rails.
To change, it only comes with incoming network broadcasts CD net and with cheap internet broadcasts eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card the price CD net is increased from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLiska will then depend on the dangerous route until now he was one and cost 160 kroners for travel between the towns of the region.
More than 50 people were arrested in the Philippines. The children were released.
Millions of people, including some basic students and their teachers, were present in the southern Philippines today.
This was done by the AFP Agency, which originally informed only over 65 graduates.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
It was held in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 milliliters reportedly used the hostages as a living shield in the flight to the police.
The local negotiating leaders are now trying to publish the rest of the gospels.
According to the AFP agency, the militias belong to the National Army (NPA), which is the armed group of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police followed the police because of the violence, which required the transactions between the two local families.
In the southern part of the Philippines, in the province of Maguinanao, was killed because of the recent massacre of 57 people.
Among the victims of the massacre of November 23, which coincided with the election of the governor, were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippines province and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested because of suspects of participation in the massacre.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim separatists are also active.
On Tuesday, however, the peace negotiations with the Filipino government again took place.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods comes into the American cinemas "Invictus: the Unconstitutional", which includes a part of the life story of the former president of the Republic of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid was given to Morgan Freeman, who had been elected by Mandela a few years ago.
Matt Damon received the role of the legendary South African champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar.
The film's cinema is also a response of critics as well as the public.
Nelson Mandela
His name was Nelson Rolihha Mandela, born on July 18, 1918 in South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sachar price, and in 1993 he and the Klerk received the peace Nobel Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are put in the film because it comes in the cinemas, which in South Africa, on the one hand, undermines the preparations for the world empire, but at the same time, the media are destroying the world's public with disturbing news about the rising race rate and the discrimination of the inhabitants from the black conquerors.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are primarily positive, despite numerous reservations against the occupation of major patrols with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of his own words on the new film.
I've been dreaming of this role for many years and prepared well for it.
Several times I met Nelson Mandela personally so that I - as you say - could receive his energy, he took part in the interview after the film's festival in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if with this film we can recall Mandelas's personality and his message.
It's a history of South Africa, but it's about every person, he added.
In the dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the British writer John Carlin's book, freely translated 'In the role of the enemy': Nelson Mandela and the game that has united the people, portrays the South African human rights defenders within his first presidential period.
Morgan Freeman strives to bring together groups of people, two race- and-one-year-olds, and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also plays in his role in the South African national tour address on the World Cup field that he won at the time of South Africa.
For the participation of the race in the dress, which is almost as holy as an act in South Africa, Mandela has received large ovaries decades ago, mostly from the white public, and has thus won the recognition of the white population.
The Rugbymeistry may have succeeded in bringing the people together again into a single people, led by the Rugbyby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa improves, it will only show itself.
The white South Africans, however, are skeptical, such as in recent interview for LN of Rugby-Fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The Mastership begins on 11 June 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers are burning for several 10 million crowns
The fire took place in the town of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the speaker of the district fire station Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units were caught at the fire.
Initially, the fire was going to burn the transformers, but later it changed its view and now the fire is removed with a mixture of water - foam and special solvents.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer-intercept.
No one has been harmed, which did not threaten the security operation of the management system, according to the company spokesman, Pavla Mandava.
The damage has been estimated to be more than 10 million kroner, and the damage will be made only after the fire.
The damaged transformer must be replaced by a new one according to Mandatova.
For over 10 years, Ceps has had nothing to do with society. Errors of this type are rare, they have been added.
The electricity supply was not interrupted, according to CEZ spokesman for Nordböhmen, Sona Holingerova, and the capacity of households, authorities and companies was not affected by the fire of the tram station.
A.G. Ceps is the sole operator of the steering system in the Czech area, the power lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It contains, renovate and develops 39 switch systems with 67 transformers that transfer electricity into distribution system and direction circuits with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jancura has a criminal case against three leaders of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, is today convicted of a violation of three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the South Sea region, Radko Martinek from the Pardubice region and the leader of the Olomouc region, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The complaint depends on the company's efforts to operate regional transport in some regions.
Finally, however, all regions signed the long-term contracts with the Czech railway.
All three leaders approach us and say that we take the roses out, so we have only subsisted the offer over the extent to which it was agreed with them.
They claimed that we are cheaper than the Czech Railways because we would know the prices of the Czech Railways that were closed last week.
There's nothing else left for us than to stay.
Because of this disappointment by the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he pointed out that he had evidence from all regions that they had taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Hasek holds the collection of punishments for the further continuation of Jancura's media show, which serves him as free advertising for his society as well as for his own person.
Of course, I am willing to defend my good name and the good reputation of my region, and I also call for more leaders.
I take it that in this case it will also be made clear that it is Jancura who manipulates the public and uses false and false arguments in the case of regional rail transport.
Jancura has already reported last week that he has invested several millions of dollars in the advertising that will be shown on the final step of the region.
He told the radio journal that he was reporting the campaign after Christmas, and that he wanted to continue after New Year.
He pointed out that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura, after the region agreed on the operation of the regional train with the Czech railway and had no comments on the order of 150 billion kroner.
According to Vancura, such conduct is legitimate and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of the traffic in the regions, he was threatened, according to Jancura, by a member of the CSSD.
The only reason is if we don't forget that we can lose the bus licenses.
He presented himself as the coordinator of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, said Jancura to the radio magazine today.
Immunization against pneumonia free and voluntary
Immunization against pneumonia changes the habit from January.
She should be the first to be free and voluntary for the families.
But now votes are being reported that the commitment will be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumonia are completed.
The Institute of Medicine has already established the maximum rates of vaccines to be paid for health insurance.
The experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
New Impfung
Ingredients free of charge for August-children
From January, children can be attacked free of charge against pneumococcals, which were born on and after the last year of August 2.
The condition is that they have not received a dose of vaccine.
Anyone who has started the vaccination in the last year or earlier must also pay further reimbursement.
The first dose of the vaccine must be given between 3 and 5 months of life of the child.
Already last year, a quarter of the families took their children against pneumonia.
The parents paid 1600 kroners and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
In turn, the experts estimate that the health insurances for the vaccine doses amount to between 300,000 and 450,000 kroners per year.
But they save the treatment that the children would need without infection.
So far, the state has issued approximately 500,000 per year for all the seizures of children.
The obligation was introduced with the so-called Janata package.
Pneumococcal disorders occur, but also severe infections, including brain tumors and blood loss.
Pneumocokine infections kill us in hospitals every year up to 28 children up to 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the obligation to influence children against pneumonia has been introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the imputation be compulsory?
At the same time, it is said that this imputation could be a future obligation.
As from January, this is to be paid by the insurance and voluntary.
For example, Rudolf Kalovsky, head of the Civil Society of Nahlas, said that the obligation would be better.
Its association will be long-term for the pneumococcal infection.
The experts at the international conference at which our association was involved were not very satisfied that we had voluntary immunization.
That's not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have achieved at least that.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the anti-pneumatic vaccination procedure.
At this point, we do not consider this at all, said his speaker Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its parts, the doctors claimed.
The president of the company of practical pedagogues, Hanna Cabrnochova, suggests that a voluntary imputation has its consequences.
If all children were infected, then you could think of the reduction in the number of relapses "In a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination has been launched as voluntary," said Cabrnochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to receive their payments against pneumococcals from the next year.
The vaccination against pneumonia is also in vain that it is paid as the first surface impact of health insurance and not from the state.
The insurance should issue the money for the prevention so that they can save for further treatment, Cabrnochova refreshes.
The doctors must buy the vaccines themselves.
However, a concern is attached to the practical medicines for the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original purpose, the vaccines should be purchased by insurance and then obtained by doctors on the same route as other vaccines issued to them by the State.
However, some of the members feared that insurance could be "the money from health insurance".
Therefore, doctors will buy the vaccines themselves and have to wait until the insurance is paid to them.
According to estimates, each practical doctor will have to invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum.
It won't even be easy, Cabrnochova says.
U.S. Artist's son participates in "Museum Diebs Stahl"
The son of the famous American Fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal 20 million dollars from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania Police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was placed in his car with trailers when inviting 90 images.
It's called Frank Frazetta Junior and another man had used a Bagger to enter the museum in the Pocono mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his performance of such artists as Conan der Barbar and Tarzan.
As reported by the news agency Associated Press, the artist stopped at the time of the incident in Florida.
AP quoted an outstanding police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family affair.
The agency reported that, according to a police statement, Frazetta Junior claimed, he was directed by his father "to enter the museum with all means in order to put all the images in a warehouse".
The Agency informed Frank Frazetta Senior that he was in charge of granting any permission.
Labour protects tax and tax increases
Ministers have defended the increases in taxes and expenditure announced in the preliminary report against the criticism of opposition, the economy and trade unions.
The conservatives said that Alistair Darling would have allowed an opportunity to "distribute" to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by making decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor is also pleased to note that he targeted workers with low and medium-income income.
Its main proposals include a 0.5 per cent increase in social insurance and a 1 per cent reduction limit of public salaries for 2011.
Social insurance colours
The trade unions have protested, however, that low-carbon recipients are punished for a recession that they have not caused and warned of prior "problems".
The introduction of social insurance - on about 3 billion United Kingdom dollars per year - has angered the private economy, which says this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic growth.
The increase, which is limited to those which earn more than $20,000 per year, will involve about 10 million workers.
PACKAGE LEAFLET
Increase in social security by 0.5 % from April 2011
In this year the economy grew by more than 4.75 % expected
New 50 % rate on banker bonus
1 Percentage increase in body tax for small enterprises
Tax charges for electric vehicles and wind turbines
State interest increase by 2,5 %
According to the estimate of the scale, someone with an annual income of $30,000 per year will be worse and someone with $40,000 per year will be worse, while a person with $10,000 per year will be more than £ 110.
The ministers said that their objective of deficit relief by 2013 meant "hard decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional taxes would fall to the 5% of top managers.
Minister of Finance Stephen Timms argues that the cut-off tax increases and cut-offs in comparison to the necessary measures would be "a drop on the hot stone".
"These are large numbers. They will bring us the deficit, and this is also necessary over the next four years," he shared with the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party’s proposals on future economic growth – which has affected the scope of the new debt and the speed of deficit transfer – have been questioned after forced to revise earlier numbers.
In his view, the economy is likely to shrink by 4,75% this year - much more than the decrease of 3,5% predicted in April – while the debt would be higher than before.
"Extraordinary opportunity"
Conservatives who wanted to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of the "debt crisis" of Labor said that the planned debt of 789 billion dollars over the next six years was unsustainable.
They added that the ministers have failed to present a credible plan to how they will repay this and to press "synically" before difficult decisions until after the election - the most recent need to take place in June 2010.
"They didn't say anything about what they're going to do," said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do this and they had to let them go."
"The significant announcements will be made only after the election, who will always win them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Work requires that schools, hospitals and the police be preserved before future cuts, unlike the proposals of conservatives, which will see the deficits faster and more.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money won by the tax increases and expenditure ceilings is used to cover expenditure for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and to argue that the plans are "made on sand".
The BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements, such as the above inflation adjustment in some invalids in April, would put the money in the position of the vote, as the money could only be recovered in the next year.
Labor needs to provide extra assistance when people need it most and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler State"
Although the ministers have not reported any state details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public expenditure will only be brought to trial in the medium term.
The recognised Institute for Taxation Studies said that the numbers of the treasurer would mean strong cuts in many areas, perhaps in the future also in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It only damages the pain later," said his leader Robert Chote.
"The significant announcements will be made only after the election, who will always win them," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant at the audit firm Deloitte.
"This was just the great preamble report, and the markets recognized it."
FBI research "Takes of US citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported US citizens because of the suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were taken to a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Pandschab province, and shared the American message in Pakistan of the BBC.
The FBI said it will be examined whether the same men were reported missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The US Ministry of Foreign Affairs said they were also looking for information about men.
Three of them are supposed to be Pakistani descent, one is an Egyptian origin and the other has an Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, of course we are very interested in the charges they are accused and under what circumstances they are held," said speaker Ian Kelly.
The FBI speaker Katherine Sweit said the authorities were informed about the arrests and were in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We work together with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identity and the purpose of their stay, if it really is the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani message in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house that belongs to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the domestic police had already been interested in the house before and that no charges were filed against the arrested men.
Reuters reported that Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the US must "co-operate with Afghanistan and Pakistan in order to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism, recruiting and training people".
The five students were reported missing by your families in Northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty sentenced "Missbriche" in Iran
According to a report by the Human Rights Organization Amnesty International, human rights in Iran is still as bad as in the past 20 years.
The report is detailed by the regime, both before and after the elected presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report said he was shot and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has shown early criticism of its human rights balance.
Officials said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After President Mahmoud Ahmadined's election, thousands of people were arrested and killed in Iran, leading to the largest street protests since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
Thousands of convicts and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Teheran Correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests of the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, some of the abuse allegations recognized and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak power plant.
But since there has been no more tolerance from the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
"False condition"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old IT student Ibrahim Mehtari, who said that he was accused of working with Facebook networks and the protest against election results.
"They beat me again in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head. They threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false statement and became, still bleeding and half unconscious, released on the street, sharing Amnesty with him.
The alleged presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who were arrested after the election were tortured in August in prison and others were raped.
However, the Iranian authorities lied to the enforcement requirements, suggesting that there had been a shortage of supplies.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been detained with 75 others for more than eight weeks in a container in a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had established a committee to investigate the disturbances after the election and the Government's reactions, but so Amnesty, the mandates and the power of these bodies would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees were not published.
The group said that at least 90 people were arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow have been used to convert a sign in Bristol into a battleground.
The skis of this park event included 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prices.
On the tip of the hangs in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100-metre long hang.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said that it gave a beautiful look at the hip of the neck, but it was also very beautiful.
It's a great view with all the lights of the city lying below.
He added: "There are some of the best ski drivers and snowboards in the country here - some right talents."
Prices were awarded for the best works of art - or tricks.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow will be left to melt.
Still her and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted for a ban on mining and the concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe is spreading, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a comprehensive and welcome report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the clearer secularised societies in Europe.
Some readers will read this new book with admiration for the last work of the author: "Why the French don't like hats" (2006), read an elegant and well-argued study of a dispute that has divided the country over half a century and has been busy and its effects are still to be realized today.
Bowens' latest book offers a more comprehensive and cheaper spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in the area.
He spent months in Moscow, schools and institutes, which now spend between 5 and 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it "Islamic Freerooms".
He is a good listener, he is giving discussions between teachers and students about the issues they are most troubling.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a rally (or both)?
Should young Muslims learn about Evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it lawful for a Muslim to use a sensory banking system to get a mortgage?
These seemingly proficient matters, he claims to be the way out of daily life, in contrast to the political dramas that deal with the media.
The author recognises a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of which is known with a name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arabic-Muslim teacher and academic teacher born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim and a good citizen of a modern secular society.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
Conservatives are misdirected against the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who asked Bowen are most at least with their salafi ghettos – the founder of the Puristic Sunni Islam, which is linked to Saudi Arabia – today shows a small but influential presence under European Muslims.
Bowen is of the opinion that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires a gift and take on both sides.
He asks whether French political decision-makers (and intellectual elites who are so patient about the separation of the Church and State) really feel obliged to be pluralism.
He points out that Muslims may experience a harsh treatment as Catholics, Protestants and Jews who, on the other hand, had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism.
He also recognises a "increasing of value abuses" as a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one dares to say "Yes, but not yet".
The most dependable view of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice, which it marks, melts with alarming speed and lives with it, which can survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have been engaged in the newing of open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their drinking water.
Richard Ellis, a author and illustrator, is a natural story of the icon of the north, the icebar.
Embarrassed in the complicated history and politics of the Walfang, he describes the long tradition of architects who have proved themselves to be on the ice bars when hunting.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an ice-cream as a 14-year-old hunter at the sea who fought only with his musket rifles is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears, who were arrested when they drowned behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers, were brought to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 o’clock in a presentation.
Even today zoos still have a million species of animals living in the wild. The climate is rare: the icebirth in Singapore has been quite green by the algae growing in the wild hair of its feathers.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat posed by the hunters for the survival of the species.
Although forbidden in Norway, America and Russia, the elegance in Greenland and Canada continues to be used by hunters in helicopters and motorbike-producing engines in order to bring their crew to the streets.
Ironically, in the waters north of these two hunting nations the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book "After the Ice" (original title "After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former publisher of the Science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and encouraging description of the science of the Arctic and a comprehensive insight into how the future could develop.
It's not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can explain the speed of the changes.
But this is not a lack of explanation.
The pioneer travels of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries allowed for the first time to bring about the prosecution of the package.
Subsequent ships in the Cold War are moving degrees of subordination.
A useful addition is satellite measurements and the large-scale delivery of Messsounds on icebergs, but still many of the people who camp outside the cold are still camping.
Anderson takes a look at the own, windy world of the flow system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater insulation channel, which is combined with cooling.
But, starting from the snow on the ice to the microscopic small wonders in the ice, all are threatened when the summer season is over, which will take place between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months... it could be us"
Marine paternityists were among the 6,000 who were lowering in Arlington Krenze
The super-free De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to put a single crange on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other seafarers, who took the journey from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Peace Court in Arlington, to dress thieves, the day was a trip to the men and women in their footsteps.
In a few months, from where we're always returned, we could be that, Robinson said about the missing soldiers.
If we were, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers gathered on Saturday morning to put borders on the farmers of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Peace Court.
Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition when he and some others decided to decouple several hundred tombers in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morill and his wife Karen, who take this trip every year, are continuing in different cities along the way to conduct events dedicated to the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a community-friendly organization, Wreaths Cross America, which also extended the event to other countries.
In this year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 borders on the Gröbers at the Arlington-Freedhof, in the area of the Pentagon, on the Countess of the Fayetteville National Park in Arkansas, on the Battery Park in New York, and on the United Airlines Airport 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation spent over $150,000 on the purchase and transport of the border.
Charlene Hunt, 70, said from Westminster that she had taken the trip to Arlington in her husband's mind, a lost professional member.
Although her husband is not finished in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way to give back something that the victims brought back.
She said that this is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family farm.
Packed in hot clothes, the volunteers traveled over the extended grasslands and hills of the rest hall.
The volunteers had older diggers from World Wars 1 and 2 and the Vietnam War as goal because they are not visited as often as the newer diggers are, so did the organizers.
The vote was joyous, children played and couples held hands while they held the fresh bicycles to the gravestones that would become grey.
Each round branch was dark green with a small red layer attached to the upper part.
The section 60, which is close to and where war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan are mainly buried, remained very quiet.
The United Service Organizations spent 1,000 borders to soften this section, but the dark mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individual whites were open, other prayings and families and friends stood in the same way in the air.
Some of the names mentioned in the stone appear, while others go down to small black-white square cards that were engraved in the thick slab, whose gravestones had not yet been made.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who spent more of their son's drying trains.
It is 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the graveyards of Marine Infrared Interfficer David Shane Spicer, who died in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
"If I'm not anymore, I want someone to remember him."
Contractors of the U.S. Government of Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has a contractor of the US government, mobile phones and notebook computers sold in the country, arrested, said representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The contractor who has not yet been identified is working for Development Alternatives Inc. with seat in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers, such as USAID, the US authorities for international development and the World Bank.
Consular officers of the United States of America's interest in Havanna are trying to gain access to the prison, which was arrested on 5 December.
The special charges have not yet been published, although, according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost everything, under the charge of "dangerous".
All the so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including simple protests and critical letters, pose a risk of arrest.
Government enemy graphics and statements are considered to be a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community, which is directed by the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly sought permission to leave the country to accept prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase the tensions between the Communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama government, which had sought to improve relations on the island.
The message of the arrest was first reported on Friday night by the New York Times.
The new US policy suggests that the United States will be rewarded if the Cuban Government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and desired products in a country where the average government service is $15 per month.
Since this year, the Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone, they will be used to send text messages, since a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost a day's wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and some government agencies, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to register their names.
On many websites access is limited.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few US citizens in Cuba who are in prison are sitting behind bars because of crimes such as drug abuse, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokesman for the US-interest representation in Havanna.
Berbena said she could not provide any further information on the arrest.
The arrests and arrests are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the award of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the American section of the "Human Rights Watch" group, who recently issued a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, the same Cuba", a presentation on the operation of Raul Castro as the leader of the country that replaced the elderly brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants would be arrested, tried and arrested very often within one day.
He said that every solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often produces a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries moved together for more dialogue.
Pakistani government representatives cover plans to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities discovered allegedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers and said that they hoped to help find an extensive network of terrorists who were looking for the Internet for radicalized young men.
It was said that they had sought an unexpected argument, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had finished it because one of them had given comments on terrorist attacks on the YouTube website.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after her arrival in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote territory of Pakistan's native village, which is the home of Al-Qaida and its terrorist training camp.
But a representative of Pakistan's Secret Service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah, the Al-Qaida leaders could not convince men that they are not part of a CIA conspiracy to detach the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held in the eastern city of Sargotha, far away from the unsurpassed mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist resort.
They were seen as part of a covered operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government officials who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were not discouraged and continued to seek to receive the right recommendations to access Al-Qaida camps when they were taken by the Pakistani criminal authorities.
The case of the five men - which are still in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI - underlines the decisive role of the perpetrators in identifying future terrorists and perhaps even more important, in deciding who is reliable.
Since the accession of 11 September 2001, the U.S. Secretary-General has made it the most urgent thing to hand over human assets within Al-Qaida.
The organizers of the organization act as sponsors who do not leave behind their commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and who may be the spies.
American Power Recruiters are subjected by A Kaida to a special test, said analysts.
Because of their potential access to US targets and their promotional values, they are also considered to be unsatisfying attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the top analyst of the NEFA Foundation with seating in the United States, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with regard to whom they have allowed access, as U.S. secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to lock someone in these groups, what better way could you go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have followed? Kohlmann said.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Require tens of thousands of demonstrators in Copenhagen Climate Action
Ten thousand demonstrators marched here on Saturday through the streets and asked the dealers at the Bella Congress Center to deal with climate protection.
Democrats said that 100,000 people had joined the event, although the police estimates were more than about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, even though a handful of masked activists burned small explosive bodies near some government buildings in the city.
One day, when the climate negotiations promoted by the UN, thousands of activists were traveling through the city, where in English there was no planet B and one in Spanish, "The Earth says "Geung".
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the journeys to Peru, the country of her mother's birth, made her aware of the challenges facing the country due to the already disturbing effects of the climate change.
This is part of the reason why I have decided to participate in the great demonstration - to continue the word and appeal to world leaders to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there is no more way to do it.
The police stopped the demonstrators from arriving near the Bella center and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the fact that they were either masked or carried pockets.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in the event of demonstrations.
According to a visitor who did not want to be mentioned, since he is involved in climate negotiations, masked demonstrators dressed in black dress were wearing several explosive bodies near the Copenhagen main channel, where several ministries are located.
They threw them near the building, he said and added that they started as lights, but then they were followed by "a few great explosions."
In the center of the convention, people gathered in front of television screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest did not appear to have reached the awareness of the main operators, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate dealer.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he said in English, "That's something I didn't even know about."
Then he went on to Mandarin and said, "Because the event place is great, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He found it dependent on the perspective of the individual, whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the broad public and different sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that they violate negotiations or the freedom of other people."
Test data show a heart attack of race
The testimony to mathematics was last week welcome news for public schools in Washington, D.C.
Although Washington’s district is still far behind the country’s schools, the highest performances show that the four- and eight-year-olds have made faster progress than the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York in the past two years.
But what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the heartbreaking performance gap between African and white students, both at local and national levels.
The average number of white black clasps from Washington D. C. has increased in the last two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), which has only increased by three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the Afro-American eyeglasser remained the same, reaching a statistically predictable point from 245 to 244.
The average number of white students was not included in the test data as the sample was not large enough.
The picture across a six-year period is also not encouraging.
The gap, which separated the white and black square clasps in 2003, when the first NAEP was found in this district, was 60 points (262 to 202).
And although the number of points children have reached in both groups has increased in this period, the difference has nearly decreased by 58 points now.
Some of the teachers in the district last week expressed their concern that the results that were celebrated by Schulkanzlerin Michele A. Rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty were awarded to the majority of white students who are already working children.
This indicates that we have raised the overall assessment by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, member of the board of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that enters into education equality in Washington, D.C.
I don't run for a span of two or three points up and down, said the democratic Washington City Treaty member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Eaton Primary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of the test points is that the city's secondary schools need urgent attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs that I respect.
But what I'm worried about is that we don't have to use the time and energy that we have to use for our secondary school.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the weak students.
In this autumn, for example, some teachers are asked to use a new learning plan, the Wilson-Less system, aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and secondary schools, which did not master the basic skills of the school at the beginning of their school course and are significantly behind their simultaneous classroom cameras.
Daily mathematics, a learning plan, which is based on games from the children's garden to the sixth class of games and life-style experiences, was brought to Washington under the former leading school inspector Clifford Janey and some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work on allowing the best measures to reach the students, which are below the level of note, said Rhee.
Others say that the NEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and can continue to provide additional money and resources for the weak schools that are sufficient to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, researched the city's results.
Conventional health means to direct its resources and management reforms to schools located in the worst areas of Washington, D.C.
The aim could be to address the political effects that work against this important agenda item.
The weak point is, of course, as in other urban school inspectors, that they try to keep the white and black medium.
Our focus is to ensure that we create a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in urban areas so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to close the performance club is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington to compete with the charter schools.
One must increase the school year to nearly 200 days to have the power to change, Janey, who, with his teacher's work last year, came to an agreement over 185 days a year, which he considered "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than for the future
The travel bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a low ceiling.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises up and shines a moment in view of the white salts, the steel fibers and the dark green rose.
Gracielas parents have almost finished high school in El Salvador.
Before long Graciela, who was protected in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and those of the other eight-year-olds of the group who studied Gettysburg, where the education cost $38,690 per year, was more than the shy visitor than the enthusiast students of the future.
"Yes! I'll be here soon!" called Graciela, who wanted to study medicine when the leader announced that she was now in charge of the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she thought to herself, when she was told about the low school professor-to-student relationship.
The College in Pennsylvania was the 7th which the children have visited on their three-day tour and now they have taken up the message in full: The question is not whether you are going to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Spanish immigrants who do not finish high school or become pregnant as teenagers, on the other hand there are also hundreds of thousands who receive college education that is necessary to grow in the middle class.
In fact, one of five of these "second generation" of Hispano-Americans concludes the college – which is a significant performance since many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without having finished high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country's labour force.
Those who study strong children say that they often have a natural disability for the school and a desire to succeed.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals and find ways to compensate for their lack of confidence with American schools.
But consultation programmes also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children to get to college, especially if these efforts continue for a long time.
If you consider incomeless children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them when searching through the system, a single measure will not solve the problem at any time, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied Spanish students.
We need to think about setting up a supportive network for these children from pre-school to high school.
The Federal programme, which had funded Gracielas College Tour, is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - a high school run - and places more than 300 million dollars a year for local school systems to start college training programs that start when there are low-income students in high school and continue to run until they finish high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, more than 60% of whom have gone to college.
Iraq's Ministry of Oil concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to re-establish its damaged infrastructure in two auctions completed on Saturday.
The 10 agreements concluded with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil indicate that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovating of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been authorized by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies were able to sell only parts of two of the 10 areas.
Seven American companies had paid for their participation in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid has taken the cuts.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields enlarged in June.
The world's representatives of American oil mills were surprised at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry.
Finally, after six years of war, Iraq opened its doors and instead of US companies to Asian and European companies, Ruba Husari, the publisher of the Iraq Oil Forum, said an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, which were still submerged by massively coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability by withdrawing the US military, are likely to have prevented American oil companies from doing so, said analysts to engage more strongly in Iraq, which owns the world's largest proven coal reserves.
In some cases, US firms were beneficial, because competitors, especially Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower pay costs and risk risk because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon mobile and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Larger US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhilippis, who maintain close relations with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and have been on the side with the Technical Council in recent years, have gone empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts agreed this week.
The State China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and was able to enter into contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, the speaker of the Ministry of Oil, Assam Jihad, said that China is on its way to become one of the world's largest economies and a technology.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can measure itself with its partners and meet its obligations against Iraq.
In the case of the pre-sale charge, the companies selected made bids, which were then compared to the fee per Barrel oil, which the ministry was willing to pay to increase the cost of each field beyond the current level.
Top planner of Al-Qaida apparently killed in Pakistan
In an apparent US rocket attack along the Pakistani border to Afghanistan, this week a top user planner of Al-Qaida was to be killed, reported representatives of the US-Terrorist fight on Friday.
This would be, if it were confirmed, the second deadly attack on a high responsibility of the terrorist organization in this mine.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities, were to be killed by a number of rockets that hit her vehicle on Tuesday near the city of Miran Shah in the province of north-west.
Foreign authorities reported that the rockets were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan's illegal country of origin.
They were in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, said an official representative of a Pakistani civil secret service from Miran Shah per telephone.
Locals who are suspected of belonging to the militias quickly fled to the scene and took everything that was left of the "completely damaged bodies".
The local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US terrorist campaign provided uncertain evidence that Somalia belonged to the deaths.
Somalia was described as the leading military planner of Al-Qaida, leading the operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in complaints around the world, noticed a leading official who wanted to remain anonymous, and pointed to the high nature of US air raids on Pakistani soil.
If you take its central role as a gift, this would also include planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from Al Kaida's top leaders and put them in operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American representative said that Somalia was rapidly growing in the Al-Qaida hierarchy and provided better links to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second representative of the authorities, but this does not reduce the risk he posed for us and our allies.
If his death had been confirmed, Somalia would have been the second leader of Al Qaida or Taliban, who had been killed since September, as in a similar attack by Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a military group in the tribal area and three other topists.
The time of the attack by the CIA is since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website contained by a non-profit organization, from an average of six operations per month to two months.
The withdrawal may be based on improved tactics of terrorist groups who have taken steps to reduce their aggressiveness and, at the same time, kill the suspected informants brutally, the site reported.
Head of UN Ambassadors in Kabul will return
The leading UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would be returned from his office in March, thereby ending a turbulent office time that would end with allegations of widespread corruption at the Afghan presidential election supported by the UNO.
One move takes place when the Obama government has decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN representative said that he supported the increase in troops, but he also expressed his concern that the US military return time plan, which would start in 18 months, could allow other NATO governments to withdraw their fighting forces.
We need to speed up the development of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian aid to help in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not lower his office, but only one of his family met the agreement reached in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted to inform UNO-
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will now continue to provide time for a replacement.
What I said is that he better start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I got here, there was a two-month vacuum between the walk of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has started looking for a replacement according to UN representatives.
The UN rapporteurs say that he has taken into account the Swedish-Italian-style staffan di Mistura, who has recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who has conducted previously UN peace operations.
This position was put to the test in Afghanistan after his former deputy representative, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September of preferring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and exchanging evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has brought back all charges, but he also said that the charges of Galbraith - which were burned - "have certainly added damage to the mission, because there is already a great measure of creativity in relation to international integration in the election".
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the actions of the US-led combat forces in Afghanistan.
He also stressed that the UN leadership would allow his followers to recruit more staff from the United States and other Western countries contributing to the Afghan mission and said that this would strengthen their confidence that their money would be used properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the relevant UN configuration arrangements had undermined his chances of re-introducing people.
The UN rules are so designed that since May, he said, only one person could be set up.
This is catastrophic and must not go on like this.
US Defence Minister Gates: Iran needs additional sanctions
Minister of Defence Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world power will soon be subjected to "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he has not participated in talks on his atomic plans.
Gates spoke during a 7-day journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq and took the view of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good choices, he said in response to a soldier's question of the probability of such development.
"One of the things that lies in my soul is that in the last six years we have learned something from Iraq which is incomprehensibility of the war."
The Obama Government is considering a sanctions package aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions may also concern the average.
He said that "a package of positive and negative incentives" is needed to "in order to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected by nuclear weapons", because "his people are not aware" is suffering from sanctions.
On Friday, Robert Gibbs, a White House speaker, warned the American government of the European top policy, that Iran must be confronted with the consequences of "liquid" if it does not comply with the requirements of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organization, the International Atomic Energy Authority.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
In conversations in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume the discussions on the restriction of its nuclear programme and would forget, on a substantial part, its storage stocks in the exchange for the urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US Government has forced this kind of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and to win time for negotiations.
Since then, however, Iran seems to have left negotiations on the provisional agreement -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is unsolicited about whether they should be committed to the United States.
That Iran has simply allowed the international community to agree on some of the proposals it had already agreed on in early October, has said that the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, has been brought together in a way and in a way that it has never been in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran.
President Obama has set the 31st time limit for Iran to respond to these proposals before other options, including those which Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "expressive sanctions".
In an opinion drawn up in New York, the Iranian representative of the United Nations has condemned what it called on Thursday "unfounded and unfounded claims" by some Security Council members to Iranian atomic activities and said they are ready to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers, "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who was supposed to return to Washington on the last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before meeting with the soldiers in Church and with Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq continue to be high, especially in relation to borders, property rights and because of the division of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to reduce conflict potential to prevent delays in US plans, to reduce the US troops' strength by the end of August from 115,000 to 50,000.
Gates also tried to spread the Kurdish concern about the former group withdrawal. US-protested gatekeepers, who called Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, said: "We will receive your security, welfare and autonomy within a United Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A Change of Course in Older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters, who thought that "Mother Earth is to have more children" and "A baby means more grave".
These lessons have been learned so well that as government officials in Shanghai, who began by the low birth rate and the elderly population in this summer suddenly to change the course and encourage young couples to have more than a child, their answer was immediate and final: "No case".
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child there is nothing left, says Wang, 31, a staff leader with an 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the Single Child Policy in China, two generations of notorious, abandoned single children, who have been lovingly called "small Kaisers", is facing a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate is 1.8 children per pair compared to 6 at the time when this policy is in force, the UN-
The division of population issues is determined, while the number of population groups of 60 years and older in 2020 is expected to increase by 16.7 per cent of the population by 31.1 per cent by 2050. This is far above the global average of about 20 per cent.
Inequality is stronger in many coastal cities with educated people, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60 years old and older, almost 22 percent of the reported residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was below one child per pair.
Xie Lingli, Chairman of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said couples in pregnant elderly babies must get to "help to reduce the ratio of older populations and reduce the labour shortages of the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old as -- but not as rich -- as the industrial countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A Progressive Restoration
In the 1978 constitution of the country, China's En-Child policy must be the most controversial one that has been introduced by the ruling Communist Party to this day.
Married couples who fail to recognize this policy must face enormous financial sanctions -- up to their three-year term in some regions -- and with discrimination at their workplace.
China's representatives have written this policy that the critical claim of natural resources could be avoided, although human rights abuses have been condemned by human rights representatives in the implementation of policies.
In rural regions, some officials have been forced to expel pregnant women who have already had a child.
In addition, many couples had been able to conduct sexual selective operations, resulting in a sudden high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually undermined their attitude toward child-politicalism.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including citizens, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been single children -- and in 2007 the tone of many hard-hearted Slovenians was softened.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research of the University of Beijing, said that government representatives had recently discussed radical changes, for example, to allow couples to have two children with a partner.
Shanghai was born in July to the first Chinese city, which launched an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Placates, which taught families to have only one child, were replaced almost overnight by directives, which described in detail who comes for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent urban employees and volunteers for family planning to search for couples at home and to pass information sheets under the doors.
She also asked for psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not just encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Incidence reaction
Although officials from a small rural town in the outlying areas of Shanghai said that an increase in the requests of couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign would not report any changes to the urban areas.
In the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, for example, only four to five applications are still available every month.
Disturbed Shanghai officials say that the number of births expected for 2010 in the city despite the campaign will still be around 165,000 -- something higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, leader of the Shanghai Family Planning Committee, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people no longer want children.
They want to give their first one the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that was also legally allowed.
But they, like many Chinese, own only a small amount of government health and life insurance.
Without a social network, they would say that this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West consider the one-child policy falsified as a human rights question, Yang said, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, you're taking the opportunity to have more than a child.
But the problem is not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their tears.
Wang, the staff leader, said that she wanted only one child, because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and we lived that everyone was upset about us.
We are not used to caring for others and do not want this to happen."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it was more unforgettable.
For parents from the middle class with double careers, through which the rate of birth is reduced, he said, it is a matter of success and must be selfish.
The age group of today's 20- to 39-year-olds grew up to see their parents fighting during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment, and they wanted no life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, makes enormous demands at the time of the parents.
A mother must give her social life at least for at least two years.
Then there's the space question -- "You have to build your apartment" -- and the life plan -- "When the child is 9 months old, you have to prepare a life course for the best schools."
Most of his friends are ready to do this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first one that has achieved a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UNO Group develops emission reduction plan
The UN climate conference -- which has so far been marked by wild posings and mutual charges -- has again focused on the publication of a document on Friday, which, for the next 40 years, has highlighted an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, where industries in the near future have to bear the greatest burden.
The text which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas management has identified the remaining obstacles as well as the way forward.
But he was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that takes time, as the next week more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will come to Copenhagen.
The text formulated by a UN working group created by its own will is moving beyond the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries in order to increase global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a palette of options for key issues, including how industrial and large coastal countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the global temperature limit should be to which political decision-makers would take.
The process will be very flexible, as John Coequyt, chief representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-six-page document, has compiled a 180-page long negotiating text to put it in the middle, which the leading UNO, Yvo de Boer, has referred to as "the big whole."
It shows the basis for a possible agreement that would reduce industry's emissions by 25 to 45 per cent by 2020, compared with 1990's limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent at the same time.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Community has also delivered talks on Friday through its assurance that the next three years will provide US$ 3.6 billion per year to support the worst countries to adapt to the effects of climate change - from the master of overcrowdings and doors to the prevention of unemployment.
The Friday, however, brought together the same white fires, which had determined the conversations in the last week.
The American climate leader Todd Starn has rejected formulations that require binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger coastal countries, if these are not financed by industry.
This train announced that the Obama government is running a tougher line with China than the Bush government's representative not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the rise of larger coastal countries and taking measures, such as the stars, who also claimed that the text would not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could be confirmed by outsiders.
Starn expressed his opinion one hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs He Yafei said that it was either the leading American air carrier's lack of "the mind" or it was "the most irresponsible" by him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not help financially to increase global warming.
Because the future economic direction of the great world powers is at stake, both within the industries and between the industries and the coastal countries have emerged.
The current struggle is similar to saving individual economies, as well as saving the planet, where China and the United States have been forced by their respective commitments, while worse countries have claimed that the two thousand most influential countries would ignore the need for scientific action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegation from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great powers should fight for those who should bear the costs of braking the greenhouse gas tank, since even the countries concerned have gone through it, to take the countries with very high greenhouse gas burden to account for their actions.
This is clearly a game for developing a new economic pre-government, such as Ulate, who is also active as a regional climate consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that are most strongly influenced by the effects of climate change suggested that they would continue to fight a legally binding contract in Copenhagen, although the leading participants said that the talks would be conducted in the best case to a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States with 43 members presented a 24-page contract draft on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who is leading the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of small island states "political pressure on the entire political process" is partly because they are now united and demand measures from the coastal countries, such as China and India.
The talks brought new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most open issues had to be clarified before the arrival of the Heads of Government in order to reach agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as Indian Minister of Environment Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister of Finance, raise their aircraft and arrive at closed doors and press conferences to hide the complaints that will be dealt with in the next week.
The pure size of the assembly -- 13,000 people go to the conference centre every day and conduct night shows where guitar-played activists are making fun of the countries that they think they have sold and sold, and contracts will be hand-made instead of hand delivery via e-mail.
The intensity is based only on: almost all the important ministers are here now and from Wednesday, 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We come to Oberlaga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for Global Policy of the Organization Conservation International.
The weights are coming.
Britain's first 225 km/h faster train defines the mountain feeling new
On Monday morning at 5 a.m., a pfeife will pass through the darkness to announce an access journey that represents a revolution in traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed lift in the country will reach London St. Pancras 225 km/h and will take 93 km in 38 minutes.
Then, to Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, Dame Kelly Holmes will be on board the first Javalin Pendler Service from London.
He hopes that the new UK service will finally connect to an international rail network faster, more reliable trains and join the large coastal areas of the Middle East, the North and Scotland to London.
The abandoned province could become viable pendler cities, reduce working hours radically and reduce the change in aircraft and car to the railway would reduce national carbon emissions and noise on the streets.
In theory, the three great parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British funds needed to build a new national rail network, which could still take the brakes at the British high-speed rails to prevent unsustainable planning and environmental damage.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company established in January which the government is to submit a feasibility study, will be delivered by Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to the Times.
This results in a detailed chart of the next planned level of the high-speed network.
The new railway line to connect London to the West Midlands will take place with a five-metre play area in urban areas and places where the effects on the environment are disputed.
On the free ground, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final route.
HS2 should also create three options for a larger, north-east leading high-speed network.
Lord Adonis will react in the morning.
The preferred option is a Y-formal route that would lead to a single high-speed route in the West Midlands.
The route would be divided into or near Birmingham and would lead to the Peninsula west to Manchester and Scotland, and another towards Nordosten to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best functional option," said one railway engineer.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced by 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part line that would not be opened before 2025 would allow passengers to return to London-Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to today's one hour.
The design would give trainers the opportunity to drive at 400 km/h speed, making the British rail network the fastest of Europe.
The first track was designed to enable 400 meters long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people to drive.
Up to 18 trains could be in operation on London-Birmingham Street every hour.
This would also mean that an end station would be needed in London, which could be made up of 20,000 passengers per hour.
In view of the spatial constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing railway station will be built to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will be informed whether this plan of his opinion should be followed or not, but the long-term public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken only after Parliament's elections.
But even if he moves the wheel, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains had to move from high speed tracks to existing ski tracks in the north of Birmingham, so the travel period between London and Scotland would continue for more than three hours.
This is a crucial point in order to ensure a change from the aircraft to the train, a measure for the rail revolution.
Taxable persons come for mortgage for 75,000 pounds of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading member of the conservatives, has taken into account the tax payer per year thousands of dollars for the costs of an orange that he has built in his home in his selection circle.
The prison speaker of the party, who was degraded by David Cameron because he complained that his mortgage had to be "of great reasons" for being a member of the subhome, has raised 75,000 pounds to allow himself to build a coal factory at his second house in Rutland.
He had to take into account the additional interest income of the taxpayer, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The underhouse officials accepted the applications at the time, and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the expenses of the sub-house members. On the last night, Duncan said that the applications could have been "not even cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest roommates, owns a two-storey house in a village in his choice circle Rutland and Melton.
In nearby houses, a purchase price of almost one million dollars (1.1 million euros) has been reached.
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fee Office, an outhouse, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he built a winter garden, which is called "Orangerie" in the plans.
Neighbors describe him as a "glasshouse for entertainment".
Duncan was also not invited to take an increased position during a recent examination of his previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on Standards and Privileges.
The Committee has released it in the last month after examining its expenditure in accordance with the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security of a mortgage over 271.406 euros (300,000 euros) from his London house to his election hall, which he had purchased a year before he was elected to Parliament.
This week's published documents show that Duncan received approximately 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as a mortgage.
In April, its claims rose to more than €1,800 (2,000) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS-Hypothec has not changed during this period, which means that the total increase in the financing of the budget of EUR 75,000 (€85 000) was made.
The normal non-study RBS-hypothetics fell from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March of this year, where he is still standing.
The latest documents published from the house show that Duncan continued to apply his address to $1,150 (EUR 1,400) per month in May.
Duncan lost his post as opposition leader in September, after a undercover reporter filmed him after he said after the spending scandal that Members of Parliament would live "from great reason".
"In essence, it means working for the state that you have to live with strong reasons and are treated as S*****e."
He said: "I have spent my money for my garden and have demanded a small portion of it to be measured by what is in it.
And I could have asked for all the fucking sums, but I don't."
The Member of Parliament, a millionaire from his former career as an oil dealer, was first arrested in May for his expenses, as it became clear that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden before he had declared with the Fee Office that this could be considered "as a superfluous requirement".
An activist, as a protest in Duncan's Rasen, has graved a hole in the form of a scholarship, after it became known that he had requested 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When he was asked about the elevated mortgage last night, Duncan said: "It was both approved by the Fees Office and by Legg as follows."
He added: "There is no debate on gaps and delays or a ban on rules or similar.
Everything is completely transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is acceptable and everything.
It wouldn't even be cleaner and clearer."
All of your fellow believers come to admire Brighton's beach shelter calendar
Beach shelters in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive adventure calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group, which is devoted to spiritual discoveries by creativity, has invited 24 owners to rent their homes for every December day with Christmas leaders as a theme.
The event started on 1 December and visitors were allowed to visit the newest houses every day from 17:30 to 18:30 at free Glüwhein and traditional Mince Pies, with dry fruits filled with bags.
The currently selected Christmas songs are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Christmas", where the hotel decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honorable spiritist of the Chichester diocese and leader of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we expect people as church to come to a rare old building? I think the church should go to the people and organize exciting celebrations.
The idea of the beach hall Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends on the evenings.
Brighton is such a wonderful creative and living place and we try to express it through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated worldwide and Copenhagen on Saturday to ask for an ambitious and mandatory agreement on the fight against climate warming, where the police took several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people call the police, hundreds of thousands say the organizers, are rocked in the colds of the Danish capital, at the edge of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could take effect from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the Climate Conference, the increasing mobilization in the world for the climate is contributing to the fact that the "political price" of a drought in Copenhagen would be very high.
The differences in the Danish capital were short-term after the train took place, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, painted windows with plastic stones and hammers, established a journalist of the AFP.
Anti-unsuspective police officers were arrested immediately and without delay.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to your assessment, are mainly members of the Blacks Blocks, of these extremely violent splitter groups that have already been established in Nato Sumit in Strasbourg, East France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has established the conditions under which hundreds of soldiers were "without distinction", criticised, and stressed that about a hundred of you "were still in the streets on Saturday evening", despite extreme colds with handshake and in position.
The more peaceful course has been carried out by Parliament towards the Bella Center, where negotiations took place.
The demonstrators have stayed about 500 meters away from the building without attempting to get in.
A stage was installed to allow the intended speakers to arrive for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators are angry with buses and trains from the largest European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Korean, and some Africans, were present.
About 3,000 people, most of you with blue skyscrapers, have made a first appearance in Copenhagen in the morning, as you have followed the call of friends of the earth, "Blue weather" for the "climate justice".
Today we go to the streets to ask for restoration of the ecological debt for the sake of the south , explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't go on like this and tell us: we have time, my Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are streams in Africa that can be flown, waterways, as was never the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, based on the adoption of the UN agreement in 1992, the movement of globalisation critics has been linked to environmental organisations.
European Commissioner José Bové, founder of the Globalisation Critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asian-Passian space, where many islands are located that are particularly threatened by warming, has given the initial committee for demonstrations.
According to the organizers in Australia, some 50,000 people have gone on the streets.
In Manila there were a few hundred people, most of the students who have gone crazy and have been hit by Bandanas, in which you have lost the sun’s energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, as well as in Canada, several hundred demonstrators found themselves in order to demand an energy approach against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" have collected hundreds of people, namely Paris, Marseilles (South), Lille (Northern), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
Some people have gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has chosen its presidents, Georgia has declared it to be a "stratey" here.
After Moscow had recognised this pro-Russian separatist geographical area as its own, Tbilisi declared the "stria".
About 131,000 people were invited to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgia war of August 2008 for the control of the South Ossetian region, another Georgian sessionist area, which was recognised by Russia.
The elections were closed at 17 hours GMT.
The electoral participation was about 58 % a few hours before the election was concluded, according to the Austrian electoral commission.
The first preliminary results should be announced on Saturday night on Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These choices are a step forward.
On the other hand, the Georgian President, Michel Saakachvili, said that Abkhazia is now under Russian total arrest, explained his press spokesman, Manana Manjgaldze.
In addition to Russia, Nicaragua and Venezuela have only recognised the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world is part of Georgia, which is legally occupied by Russia.
After it was separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, where thousands of people die, Abkhazia would like to prove that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen for Mr Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who chose a choice in a choice hall, which was located in a school in the capital of Soukhoumi, chose a beautiful white building with a few palm trees before the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes in the Black Sea.
Large images of which the bagapch is to be seen by the Russian President and the Head of Government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are located everywhere in this small area, which has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, that is in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he has said at a small festival, as an expression of the support of Moscow, in particular with regard to the decision, to acknowledge the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, responded and raised a glass of vodka.
On the other hand, the opposition, which was represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticised the agreements reached with Moscow last year, as those in Abkhazia Russia have left the control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims neither to support the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus a vote is required to win the election.
If none of the candidates reach this limit value, a second selection round must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos World, Climate Change in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated around the world on Saturday to ask for an ambitious and binding contract from the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, at any time ready to use about 700 people, have established an important demonstration.
Three thousand people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands of organizers have demonstrated in the afternoons in the Danish capital, receiving delegates from 193 countries seeking an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train was headed by Bella Center, where negotiations took place.
The demonstrators have kept about 500 metres from the center and have not tried to interfere.
A stage was built to allow the scheduled speakers to arrive at the night with a candlelight, with the participation of former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Some moments after the train was over, a group of demonstrators who were completely dressed in black and armed with backstones and hammers started to insert discs, established a journalist of the AFP.
Anti-unsuspected police officers have suddenly hacked you into and caught you without notice by shooting some of you on the ground.
The police reported that 600 to 700 people were arrested and made it clear that it was mainly about members of the Blacks Blocks, these extremely violent splitter groups that were already famous for Nato Summit in Strasbourg, East France, in April.
On the evening, a police officer was present during the riots where about twenty people were arrested by the police, while the child was injured by a plastic rock. Four vehicles burned near a house.
"We have the extreme groups in the grip," stated the police speaker Henrik Jacobsen, while the commanders of the order forces circled in the air.
The majority of the protesters who arrived by train or with their own vehicle from Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in the blue rain forest, arrived in Copenhagen early in the morning after the call of "friends of the Earth" to a first group to represent the "Blue Sea" for "climate justice".
"Today we go on the road to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the South," said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say again : We still have time," says the singer Angelique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa, there are rivers that flow, there are waterways that you can run through, which never happened before."
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was called by the 1992 adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of Globalisation Against Globalisation has been linked to environmental protection organisations.
The French Members of the European Parliament and Globalisation Critic José Bové, said against AFP, he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice." "There is no difference today between the fight against earthquakes and the fight for another world."
The Oxfam organisation has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christiansensen or former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turn to the masses.
The Asian-Passic space in which many islands are especially vulnerable to earthquakes has given rise to demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 50,000 people went on the street in Australia.
In Manila a few hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed red with Bandanas, before the city administration of the Philippines’s capital for solar energy advertising.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people, especially Paris, Marseille in the south, Little in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east, were brought together during the demonstrations organized by the network of 350.
In Geneva several people gathered.
The fécher's geography and history goes according to Chatel, strengthened by the reform of the Lycées.
National Minister of Education Luc Chatel explained in an interview that appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du Dimanche" that the fécher's geography and history are strengthened by the reform of the Lycées, although they are not required to be taught in the terminal (12th school year).
"The students of the Première (11th school year) now have all four hours and the same program," says Mr. Chatel.
For the Minister, "this quality must be overcome," for he says "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but in large and large ways a concentration "the best students."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) cannot be a sub-profile of science," he continued, stressing: "I haven't heard a lot of historians and intellectuals who have been involved in the lack of historical and geographical education in the terminals of technical enlightenment."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey revealed in humanity that nearly seven out of ten francs (69%) criticized the government project of the binding education in history and geography in the terminal S (12st year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also criticized this project, as well as the link and some representatives of rights.
The Minister replied, however, that there was no question of a restriction on the philosophy of the S Terminal Program.
Luc Chatel also defended the education reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) had called for a protest against the project, which they felt was the subject of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister indicated that at the beginning of the year, at Master 2 (M2), they were subject to a professional qualification test and at the end of the year an authorisation test to verify their competences.
In addition, they conduct practice during the year in M2 and then teach a year before the students as teachers in practice.
He continued: "If you add all the practices offered before the performance test, you will be able to reach even more hours that you spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the Minister explained that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "something that does not exist in education."
He confirmed once again that he wanted to remove the school card "by 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normal Superior"
Fifty minutes to talk about the use on the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change" had to deal with tomorrow at the School Normal Superior in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist of the AFP, peaceful Nobel Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences in which experts are returning to the public every fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
One wants to learn more about what people are reaching and how they feel, Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, at the end of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the names the students gave the fish in the school base.
"Of the experts, twenty discussion participants were chosen, even after their charisma," he says.
"You can speak for hours for climate warming. But the core goals can also be expressed in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke only with the help of folie.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in his hope that the audience would agree that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific document."
The videos run by these conferences will be found online on the school side from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months.
Payment delay : rising prison values, planned actions
The trade unions of the criminal service officers called on a general day of action on Friday to ensure that the premiums and overtime paid from budgetary grounds until January are transferred before Christmas holidays.
The 2nd Association of Criminal Appeals Officers ("FO Penitentiary") called on employees who have no service to demonstrate tomorrow before the Criminal Court and to block them in order to pay attention to the "devil of those who are in charge of them".
The 3rd Association of Criminal Appeals Officers ("CGT Penitentiary") called for "to join a strong mobilisation in the various prisons", to which the non-payment of the overtime, night-time payments and the Sunday and holiday supplements in December will be burned as "suspendable and unacceptable".
The first union of criminal appeal officers, the autonomous federal criminal union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show discontent and jealousy."
The leadership of the Criminal Court and the Ministry of Justice stated that the excessive hours in 2009 were very busy and not all of them were expected in the budget. However, they guarantee that the remaining requirements will be met in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced on the evening, Michele Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the officers of the criminal service, which guarantees that the payment will be made in the next month.
"I am very well aware of the staff's efforts to maintain and modernise our criminal system," said the Minister of Justice in this letter.
"I have pointed out the leadership of the criminal system to take immediate action so that such a situation, which has been caused by the lack of appreciation of the hours of the attack, will not continue in the future," added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
Therefore, the December salary falls higher than the lead staff, who benefit from higher service and target premiums, explains the UFAP/UNSA, for which the "budgetary burden" needs to be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional FO works in Marseille and announces to "all assemblies and meetings" until new instructions are issued.
"The staff will not go to Sundays and holidays at work if the hours from October are not yet paid in December. This applies also to their over-hours," says the FO Rhône-Alpes-Avergne.
"In a time when we are given more tasks without more staff being hired, the attempt to save ourselves from staff's money is more than inappropriate," says Bordeaux's CGT.
As a result, the situation is not the same in all regions. Some are less affected than others.
However, it is wrong, the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama is the view that he distributes Christmas more and more gifts than he gets himself.
The American President, Barack Obama, who was the first time spent Christmas with his family in the White House, has announced at the TV talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he always distributes better gifts than he does himself.
On a special mission that was broadcast on the ABC channel on Sunday evening, the President and his wife, Michelle, gave an overview of how they will spend the holidays in their new illustram home.
Even Bo, the small quadruple associate of the family, will be with the party.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo", confirms Michelle Obama and adds that the dog also receives a gift of course.
Michelle Obama showed her husband's claims about the quality of the gift. "I made you a beautiful gift last year," she told the president.
"So please," he slyly replied, pointing out to the first Lady's Perleonekket: "And who gave you this?"
During this sudden explosion in untidy atmosphere with the famous television moderator, Barack Obama had so much support during his election fight, the president and his wife also talked about gifts that they most loved as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bike with ten times and also a basketball ball that his father had brought him, which he had seen very rarely, to Christmas from Kenya.
"I remember when my father visited us one Christmas night and brought me a basketball ball," said the President.
"At first, I realized in my life that I had this ball from him."
The first Lady remembered her side at her pumpkin house.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house, so I put it all on the wall instead of grouping it around the fireplace. But I loved this little pumpkin house," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL confirms that he was transferred to an artificial compound
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles because of significant "knockings" after an operation in France. According to the people around him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was moved into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was re-operated on Thursday night at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors "Drug damages due to the operation of a band crew", which he had experienced in Paris on November 26, which added that the damage had taken place in Paris.
However, the singer's production company wanted to clarify the situation "under control" and said that a new medical opinion would be at least 48 hours later.
According to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, however, Johnny Hallyday was moved into an artificial coma to avoid "sickness and complications".
Only 48 hours later, however, some more certainty about the patient’s condition was added to RTL when he opened his eyes.
At the request of the AFP, there was no confirmation or comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "out of certain sources", that after its first operation in Paris "no drink" was placed.
The Rocker was operated in the international hospital of Parc Monceau because of a band crash.
The attack planned for several days was carried out by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This post was not available on Thursday for comments against RTL.
After the operation of Johnny Hallyday, the singer was introduced to the hospital at Cedars-Sinaï in Los Angeles because of a follow-up infection after the attack.
The singer Eddie Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, was against RTL on Thursday at the sight that his friend was just going through a "beautiful talent". He assured, however, he needed "no worry" to make the rock musician, as this was "a good fighter".
"He had called me before his departure to Los Angeles. I told him it was a weakness to put himself in a plane 12 hours after such an operation," said Eddie Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening the producer of the singer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "well reacts to antibiotics" and that "the infection has been reduced".
Mr Camus also stated that he had spoken with Laeticia, the wife of the singer, and he had not given any special encouragement.
However, the concern about the singer’s health has grown ever greater since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he was beaten on his jacket.
Two months later, to the general surprise of the statement that Johnny Hallyday had a "small darmkrabs-OP", which led to a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer adopted his long "Tour 66" as an absolution tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented explicitly. Fans and journalists have not ceased that the singer had the ability to move.
Only in mid-November did the people around him have to dementia a resupply to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Kurzbahn: First place for Bousquet over its favorite distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medal winner at the 2009 Swimming Environment Championships, has become an international title on Thursday, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 short train station in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time the polyurethanes were allowed, there were only three world-class cards, while a real record flow was expected.
A record was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m layers of the Lords.
Woe to Bousquet, who wanted to take over the world record at 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in large beaks (20.94).
At one of the two king's distances in the Swimming, 50m-Friestile, the 28-year-old franchise was established in 20.53 S., in a final with ten skiers at the start (usually eight are) - a premium at international level.
Bousquet forced the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he did not create it to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe more and more, and in the present case, I have said, if the world record is in my wealth, I will try it."
Like Bousquet, almost all Swimming in polyurethane rings, which have been banned since 1 January 2010.
With 238 World Records since February 2008, these combinations end their epos in Istanbul, which began in 1999 in the same fight.
The use of the combination has not been paid at the end of this time for the German Paul Biedermann, two world masters in the Becken of this summer in Rome and World Record.
The young skimer has not been able to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77) yet he has spent himself with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danes Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give it all this time.
I knew I couldn't get a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my mission."
"Lobintsev will be a major opponent in the future," declared Beedermann.
USA : Zola record estimated at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman tablet, calculated at the French writer Emile Zola, was valued at $1.5 million on Thursday for its value, as is the artist Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It comes from the third century after Christ and has always been valued with $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble, on the "four scenes of the dionysos in a sophistical architecture decoration, surrounded by satyrs and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, vice president for the expansion of Roman and Egyptian antiquities at Sotheby, on Tuesday against the AFP.
It was sold in hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still running, but this part is certainly what most buyers have promised so far," says the speaker of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy against the AFP.
The discovery of this capture of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The plate was almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family at home, and then it covered pieces for the French actor Cécile Sorel, who was found in her bathroom of her Paris hotel and was used by Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshall Petain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
In a study of the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this tablet was part of an "Erbes of Emile Zola" which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the "Rougon Macquat" Fresco.
Zelayas Travel test from Honduras to Mexico has been completed
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the Hungarian President-in-Office Manuel Zelaya to domestic land as no longer compatible, after which the Portuguese Government had rejected this direction as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya last night, everything seems to indicate that the possibility of carrying out this transfer is unique, said the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
According to the immigration authority, the aircraft provided by the Mexican Government, which was caught in the mid-week in Salvador for the purpose of the transfer of Mr. Zelayas, was returned to its destination.
The Portuguese government wanted Mr. Zelaya to "give thanks" and to seek political asylum for him abroad.
The President-in-Office, however, urged this because he wanted to return to Mexico as a welcome official.
The Putsch regime "has experienced a new mess by trying to move me to my expenses (...), they wanted me to give up," said Mr. Zelaya on Thursday against Radio Globo, in which he has been reporting frequently since the beginning of the political crisis in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here well and wish ten years, here I have my guitar, added the wounded president who had fled to the Brazilian message of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, following a deal.
The Mexican message has presented us with a request for guidance that we cannot accept, however, as it did not contain any request for asylum, Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of Interior of the Portuguese Government, explained against the Honduran Radio HRN.
I'm looking for no country around Asyl, Manuel Zelaya answered in an interview with the TV channel, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible trip from Honduras, he would have underlined, he would only take over as president of the Honduran people.
The rumors about a visit by Mr. Zelayas had mobilized the supporters of the wounded president, who had responded to the Brazilian message and gathered around it, while the military had strengthened his use there.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Portuguese Government.
This, in his view, reveals the marginal character of this government in view of international standards.
Zelaya, who had joined the Socialist President of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, was arrested on 28 June, on the day of his public inquiry to prepare for his re-election against the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he returned to Brazil on 21 September and had fled to Brazil.
If he leaves this behind, he will be arrested for his high-ranking act, where he is accused by the justice, then the Portuguese Government.
The Portuguese President, Roberto Micheletti, was able to organize a presidential election on 29 November to cancel Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized in the course of the contested election by the United States, however, by the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later the Congress had voted massively against Mr. Zelayas back to the office until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street in the wake, the US trade balance eats optimism
The New York Stock Exchange concluded on Thursday with a high rate, the figures of the U.S. trade balance testify to a short-term holding of the United States shares as well as its partners: the Dow Jones estimated 0.67%, the Nasdaq to 0.33%.
According to the figures at Börsenssensal, the Dow Jones Industrial Average from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, the Nasdaq once again dominated by technology, from 7,13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The extended Index Standard & Poor 500 was written by 0.58 % (6.40 points) at 1,102.35 points.
There are good news from various economic groups, Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
However, this remained anecdotic under the premise that the market only focuses on "half-glass", so it measured.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, the investors are mainly fixed on the figures of the US trade balance, "which represents an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The US trade deficit fell by 7.6 % to $32.9 billion in September in October.
In contrast, the analysts had calculated this with a deficit growth.
Both imports and exports have been added.
The big news is the increase in the overall volume of trade, especially in the good export, which reflects the economic growth of the United States' main trading partners, commented Christopher Cornell of the Company Research Economy.com.
In contrast, the unemployment reports in the United States have increased in the past week against all expectations and have now reached the level of 474,000 questions.
However, the average value for new workers during the last four weeks "falled at the bottom of the year", said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The obligation market has failed.
The profitability of state loans for 10 years is 3,482 % compared to 3,432 % of the service provider, and the profitability of the loans for 30 years is 4,492 % compared to 4,408 % of the previous year.
Cuba: Hundreds of participants who stand out "Damen in Weiss"
On Thursday, several hundred of the Cuban parties, together with several political prisoners, were arrested on Thursday for the purpose of the World Court of Human Rights, and a further trial, resulting in the temporary arrest of a good thousand dissidents.
For the fourteenth "women in Weiss", married or nearby political prisoners, were posted on open streets by government parties under Raul Castro, just as they were on the Fussmarsk in the centre of the capital, in order to request the release of political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "Saldner!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "He lives Fidel and Raul!" the powerful parties were scanted against the dissidents with a high fever.
The latter were briefed by civilians who appeared to be "protecting their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "women in Weiss" had taken place in Havanna last night, when it came neither to victims nor to arrests.
In the port area of Vedado, a dozen dissidents, who also began the demonstration on Thursday, in view of the International Human Rights Day, were temporarily arrested by civil police officers, confirmed by AFP.
According to this journalist, the police have forced dissidents from the government to be forced into civilian vehicles.
The temporary arrest of dissidents under such conditions usually limits only for a few hours.
As advocates of the Sakharov Prizes awarded by the European Parliament in 2005 in Weiss, the "women in Weiss" have not accepted an opinion on the purpose of the "Pray for the release of all political prisoners", whose number, according to the dissident list, is around 200 people, organized, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda holds a 20-year prison sentence.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, from which to date 53 sit behind the gates.
The Cuban authorities shall feel the regime opponents as "solder" or "agents" in the service of the declared end, the United States.
One reason is that the Cuban television on the demonstration events on Thursday replaced the report between the military pro-government fighters and the "anti-revolutionary" report.
Cuba, led by a Party of Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violations of rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of opinion.
Vainzier kills eight-year-olds with the messer and left 5 wounded in Clichy-la-garenne
A two-metre armed passenger killed an eight-year-old in the city of Clicky-la-Garenne (Houts-de-Sine) and injured five others on Friday at midnight.
According to the first statement of the investigation, 28-year-old attackers had been injured by eight-year-olds for a short period of time or before an apothecary on the Boulevard Jean-Years with two months, which, according to police records, had been present by witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, was reported to be responsible for the police union Alliance in the hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or before the same apothecary, he had a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about the driver, got caught and was injured.
The first two victims were seriously injured in the hospital, where the eight-year-old died.
The other injured is in danger of life, since he was exposed to apparently life-threatening organs by police sources.
The pregnant woman has become accustomed to the events and should have been hospitalized by a police source following the shock condition.
The armed man who appears to be in police custody under alcohol or drugs should also be on the road, the entire Boulevard Jean-Jaures.
It would have damaged two other passengers, apparently random: a three-year-old and a four-year-old, after which the two of them were too heavy.
The scenario stayed in the dark at night.
He had been armed with two meatmeres, which he crossed behind the back, explained in front of the place Arnaud Pressé, a representative of the Alliance of the Area of Skins-de-Seine.
Several passengers, including young people, are supposed to have tried to force the driver’s licenses, according to the AFP’s testimony reports.
I've seen a kernel in the tricyclers with a green west.
Three young people are trying to step in.
They didn't create it because the kernel was well built, told Alberto, a descendant of a nearby bar.
A Horde fell on him, added, including a city cop who broke his arm.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Years, at the height of the house number 61, two city police officers, including her predecessor, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured by mercenaries, such police statements.
The event took place in one of the main players of Clichy-la-garenne, where there are a number of businesses.
The passengers have come to me to tell me there's a wounded person out there.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I brought her to the first relief station and noticed a fascinating phenomenon in the dining area, told Frédéric Allion, a 35-year-old apothecist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about three-year-old, was injured by cuts.
The State Police have finally taken over the man who did not take out the papers.
The government administration of Nanterre has commissioned the district referendum of the Criminal Police of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) with the statement of case.
The nursery has been hospitalized at Donnerstagbend.
In view of his condition, he has not been duly taken into account.
A police source does not conclude that he is being delivered to a nervous system.
According to another police source, there were six police officers to arrest him at the police station in Clichy, where he was executed.
He is "in a state of over-resurrection" as "all spiritually confused such as to free the forces during the course of action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer requires re-establishment of the prosecution
The French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski, the lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski, has asked again on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States), to allow the prosecution against his mandate, which is currently in Switzerland due to a sentence of more than 30 years before the trial.
Chad Hummel, Director of the "Pianist" Justice, has condemned three judges in the second district of California at the time of the negotiations in 1977.
I insist on the place of punishment, said Mr. Hummel, before he added that the behaviour of Justice Laurence Rittenband "is a cold running down the back at the time of the trial with the case".
According to him, the - between the dead - the Richer Rittenband, before this claim was made, was discussed with a state lawyer who should have told him that Roman Polanski had deserved a home -- which represented a serious procedural error.
This discussion was initiated in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: followed and desired), which was the subject of the questioning by the State lawyer David Wells.
Finally, at the end of September, M. Wells stated that the authors of the documentary film had "delegated".
If the Court of Justice should refuse to introduce the criminal procedure, Mr Hummel will require the conduct of a process which would allow him to provide evidence for his argument.
On the other hand, the complaint has repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the suspension of the proceedings against the accused cannot be taken seriously into account until Roman Polanski appears before the court.
The 76-year-old director was expelled from the United States in 1978, even before the release of the sentence for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
Since then, he has not moved to the United States.
The deputy state attorney of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, stated that Roman Polanski must "be able to live in the negotiations".
In this regard, did you want to spread the message and not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other people who claimed that flight is an opportunity? Mrs. Ashama asks.
According to your opinion, "the filmmaker asks the court for a case and thus respects his authority".
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to make their decision – even above all, "that there are still other refugees".
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the establishment of the prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also once again called for the suspension of the criminal procedure.
She recalled that her client would no longer hesitate to be subjected to any recurrence of the Polanski case and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was right.
Twenty-three years are enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on the occasion of an American court order.
After spending two months behind the guitar, he was sentenced to a possible delivery to house arrest in his chalet in Gstad.
Wall Street is broken down by the rise of the dollar and is closed without a course.
The New York Stock Exchange concluded on Friday without a course, in a market that was better developed between indicators than expected in the United States and an increase in the dollar: Low Jones won 0.63%, Nasdaq however lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the end of the figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10,471,50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points have been allocated.
The extended Index Standard & Poor's 500 is estimated at 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106,41 points.
"Truely said, the market is quite quiet," Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset noted.
"It remains very limited, the volume of trade has become very small, and I think this will remain the same until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators, which "helped to improve the market's view of the solidarity of economic recovery", the analysts of Charles Schwab agreed together.
In the United States, sales in retail trade increased by 1.3% in November, so it was already two months later and far more than expected.
The confidence of American consumers has continued to improve significantly in December, although 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan Index.
However, the indexes were broken down by a new increase in the dollar rate, which has achieved the highest position against the euro for two months, resulting in '' the pressure down on the sectors of the economic situation," Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank said.
The technological values have lost something on the ground.
The obligation market has expired.
The interest rate for the loan over 10 years increased by 3,540 % on Wednesday evening by 3,482 % and the loan increased by 4,497 % on the day before.
Election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of running through South Africa, 112 candidates for the title of Miss World will pass the last door on Saturday to realize their dream: To be chosen for the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch it before a billion television.
During this great beauty fair, which will be held for the second time in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already taken their ticket to the semi-final.
Ms. Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were briefed during her African stay at Miss Sportive or also Miss Top Model.
This was a real strudel of pleasure.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn, were simply extraordinary.
I've seen many things and made every lot of experiences!, Mrs. Sierra Leone said with great enthusiasm.
This competition will take place in South Africa for the ninth time and will be delivered on Saturday, from 17 a.m. to 15 a.m. in mid-European time, north of Johannesburg.
I couldn't imagine a better country to pass on my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, undermining Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For young Russians, her second residence in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the re-discovery of "territory landscapes".
After a month of Galas, trials, encounters with the press and Safari, the Miss now focuses on the competition.
Inderin Pooja Chopra hopes to enter the steps of Priyanka Chopra, which was elected 2000 and will also be available at this election, as well as after Aishwarya Rai, who was elected 1994 and became both Bollywood stars.
Of course, it is the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not just about appearance here.
We are messengers from our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India will enter with a wide range of seats.
The organizers will then underline this 59th edition with music and dance.
The candidates are validated in traditional ways and do not forget, in the bathroom.
The presentation is presented by a television moderator, the Chinese Angela Chow, the former beauty queen of South Africa, Michelle McLean, and a representative of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it is wise to receive the world with a little overcrowded heart and steel, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, have made a Safari, visited the famous township in Soweto, but this time it costs the bike and the local cuisine.
It was quite unusual, however, to meet with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them his hand.
Not usually for a Head of State, Ms. Sierra Leone.
However, its most beautiful memory remains undoubtedly the release in Kapstadt (Southwest) of the football championship in June 2010, a kind of country to buy something more for this event.
I'm dealing with people I could probably never get closer to.
I'll be back safely for the 2010 World Championship, promised by Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news to Johnny Hallyday are according to his son David "very positive"
The news to Johnny Hallyday are "very positive", his son David assured his son on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles Airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He's very strong, it's running all very well, David Hallyday explained the press at the beginning of the plane, where he arrived shortly after 13 hours of local time (21 MEZ) from Paris.
The son of the singer, who had a relaxing impression, ensured that he would "fastest" in the Cedars-Sinaï hospital, in which Johnny Hallyday was delivered on Monday because of a bacterial infection after an operation in a band crash on November 26.
The singer was "in Los Angeles this night moved into an artificial coma to alleviate his severe pain and to conduct his treatment, the press service was announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred by the doctors of the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles to an artificial compound in which he was transferred to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up after a band-up operation on November 26.
The singer had to undergo surgery again on the night of midnight on Thursday, due to the changes caused by the last attack.
His wife, Laeticia, participated in a school event in the French Gymnasium of Los Angeles, in which her daughter Jade went to school on Friday.
The head of the department for orthopaedic and traumatic surgery at the Pitié-Salpétrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday in the hospital in Los Angeles.
The manufacturer has severely charged the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer at the International Clinic du Parc Monceau in Paris on November 26.
We were told that he set up the purest masker.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were completely equipped, said Mr Camus.
I heard that perhaps a court procedure will be initiated, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday is "too fast and this is done with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles".
I telephoned this doctor personally, who assured me that he viewed this trip as totally unproblemable, but I was surprised because I had already had two tape drives behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced at RTL that the singer seemed to have left the hospital after the operation "without draining, without everything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He had the actor Marie Trintignant, who operated a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuily-sur-Seine, where he practiced at this time.
In 2007, he also operated the actor Charlotte Gainsbourg to rescind a haematoma after brain bleeding.
However, he is also a doctor with a double call, which has already been condemned several times because of poor operations and should not be forgotten because of tax fraud and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the medical department, has called him "a man without a scar" who has to answer "regularly" before the Chamber and "all others are recommended".
After a few days of Switzerland, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on the Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This explained that the intervention would be "perfectly run" and post-operative investigations would be "normal".
The operation "did not cause any bleeding before and therefore does not require a drain", he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been discussed since the summer, seems to be a question.
It is quite clear from the hand that something is too close for the continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), Mr Camus said.
The UDF (Union for the French Democracy) party will be energetic and urges the party Nouveau Centre to stop using its seal.
The party association, which is supervised by François Bayrou's MoDem Party, has responded with a strong response on Friday to a reconnaissance trial of the Sigel, first founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, by the president of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and called on him to make no use of this seal on a document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, as he is of the opinion that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after he had reached the left.
The Defence Minister, whose partner is the UMP, wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In the wake of his efforts, he had received the support of MEP Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now with NC), who claimed the property of the UDF brand, since he first applied for this brand at the National Institute de la Proprietété Industriale.
However, the company company of the UDF, who was monitored by François Bayrous's friends, made it clear that they did not agree and set a deadline for not using this seal and transfer it to the owner of the market.
In the last days, you have made numerous statements that you would suggest your political movement, the UDF seal + company+, wrote the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 bureau members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem Party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrisian Federation.
You probably also believed that you had the right to print the name of this movement +Nouveau center+, of the Slogans + of today's UDF + on their political material and on your website's website.
As you know, you have no access to the use of this seal, explained the UDF's business site and urges the party to "remove the name UDF from all material and from (her) website immediately".
In addition, Hervé de Charette sought to transfer the rights of the brand to their legal claimants.
If you refuse this, we will appeal against you in order to take account of the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In her letter, she stressed that "UDF" has been a full political movement since 1978 and reminds us that Morin and his friends "have had the choice" to leave these 2007 to create a competitive movement, as it had already done in 2002 to establish the party "UMP".
Therefore, the New Center has no rights to use the UDF-Siegel (Union pour la democratie française).
They also recall that the last UDF 2007 Congress has adopted the three-year accession to MoDem party and the establishment of a business establishment to protect "the material and moral interests" of the movement based on Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
What Hervé de Charette needs, the business office continues, "what he has been asking for when he has called for the brand name, has been no longer a member of the UDF for three years" but the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and misleading way from the lack of the support of the Acronym UDF to do this for himself.
Continue to think that this lack of transparency is the best way to turn into a punishment, and ironize the NC strategy: "But we seem to be more willing in politics and in life to make a name, rather than try to get out of theonymity by resorting to a name that has no legal claims."
Case Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier is condemned for the abuse of weakness
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to assess the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether he, like the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, has used a weak moment of eight-year-olds to raise some of their assets.
On 15 and 16 April 2010, the 62-year-old photographer who is known for his photo will have to be responsible for committing a court-martial weakness, a fine which will be punished with a maximum of three years' imprisonment and a fine of EUR 375,000.
This decision means that there will actually be a process in this case which is worthy of the saga of one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter are pregnant and at the same time have the rings of the L'Oréal cosmetics.
However, the 15th Trial Chamber also arranged a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, conducted jointly by three doctors.
L'Oréal's archipelago and principal tax collector has refused to undertake such an investigation, especially under the conditions of the state administration of Nanterre.
The doctors appointed on Friday should still report before 10 March 2010 that you are clearly aware of whether and at what time Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to take these tests.
I'll talk to her, the lawyer of Mrs. Bettencourt, Me Georges Kieiman, after the trial.
What is involved in the law of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, is very satisfied with the decision of the Court.
This is an excellent news (...). The opinion is shown that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady who has to be protected confirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has filed a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, and accused her of exploiting her mother's weakness for years in order to raise savings of a billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
On your side, Liliane Bettencourt had always refused to be manipulated by the photographers, whom she viewed as a long-term friend.
Although the court had to check the admissibility of the complaint filed by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the plaintiffs of lawyers had led to a large family block on Friday.
Thus, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt referred himself to three letters sent to her client (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she was missing the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Please explain to my daughter that I have written to Banier for fifteen years, one to two days a day.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to her since her marriage."
The State administration of Nanterre is again of the opinion that the complainant has no right to respond, especially because a presidential judge has rejected her application in the last days, to initiate a judicial procedure against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is completely legal, does not stand under protection and has no premeditation.
No one has the right to act in their place," confirmed the representative of state government, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The Court has now decided to issue a judgment after the procedure for the admissibility of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers has been carried out.
Manager revolution or the end of the strategic morning announcement?
If nothing changes with the leadership of the large French company, our fight for the development of economic intelligence has been beyond ...
For over a decade, the position of the company vis-à-vis the consumer before the marketing revolution has been held by large companies in respect of its employees, said: "values" for the staff are the best that was planned for the consumer products of the technicians in the business.
By placing the customers at the center of the company, the marketing revolution has given the strategies for the acquisition of markets in place ... although the authoritarian trial products separate factors Customer preferences to be relinked regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to a deadly demolition.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tops of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of F&Eand, which is even more decisive, on those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligent Economy = Economic Intelligence) requires "proactive action by all parties involved (...) and a forward-looking approach"; it requires employees to use a completely contrary to the instructions of the authority management.
That is why we call for a business revolution that would include equalizing employees in the middle of the company's claims to the customers.
The very conditional benefits of internal opinion questions
Are the internal issues of opinion, how did the questionnaire, which divided Orange's recipients, appeal to this revolution in relation to the management practice?
I was afraid, I'm not.
- Firstly, because I was able to determine that the whole addition in view of a new situation after many of the countries finally reaches the point of doing so, first of all, what it has always done.
Also because of authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power-proportional takes on the meaning of its own failure.
And finally, because most driving forces have a very simple idea of human behavior.
From the great engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanical.
They take over with intellectual comfort the old conservative theory, which was recently activated by the U.S. neurosciences, and was widely distributed by research institutes and the media.
So and by suggesting that it is possible to engage the "Hebel" (sic) in the engagement of employees, a current Le Figaro.fr survey of Ipsos confirms the driving forces in a position to a mechanical control system that is inappropriate for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobility factors
Instead, a necessary business revolution for the free functioning of modern companies is forwarding the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists of incorporating a basic protocol in any transfer or practice of control: for the recipients, the commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to realize part of their dreams, their dignity and their purposes.
Currently, only studies from the multifunctional analysis take this concept of the motivation of employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a given doxa that allows them to assess what it offers them to achieve their purpose of life.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobility factors, companies can control, predict and prevent their "social performance" leadership and re-place their human resource management at the right place.
Thus they create a productive land that is useful for the development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The speech of Oslo: the "right war" brings Obama Lob from the right
On Friday, the American law welcomed Barack Obama's earlier speech in Oslo and was pleased that the 2009 Nobel Prize for Peace has defended the concept of "right war" against the enemy of the United States.
The conservatives who opposed the award of the price to Obama on 9 October this time hailed the president's speech, such as the former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, explained Palin, the face of the right flight of the Republican party in the newspaper USA Today, adding that she had brought herself the subject of a "man-made" war into her so-called memoirs.
The war is of course the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who fought two wars by his predecessor George W. Bush, fought in Iraq and in Afghanistan, tried to justify the use of violence on Thursday in Oslo; one way to explain his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, expressed the view that the president had read "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, and the former president of the House of Representatives, who acknowledged in the words of Obama, particularly the reference to "the existence of evil in the world."
In some parts, this speech was quite historically perceived, Ginrich, who was questioned in the radio broadcast "The Takeaway".
The former rapporteur, who is considered by some as a potential candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he would be pleased to see a "President of the Left" who reminded the Nobel Committee that "they could not be free and could not afford a price for peace if the use of violence did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer by George W. Bush and a middle editor at Washington Post, Obama has held "a very American talk".
In addition, as a cosmopolitan, he spoke "as an American president" when he pointed out that the Europeans "live as a security blouse which they did not create themselves and do not do much for their protection," says Gerson.
Among the few unconfirmed rights, former UN messenger John Bolton, a falcon of the Era Bush, referred to on the website of the National Review Online as "long, high-end and inspirationless".
On the left hand of the President, democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barak Obama defends the backbone of the fighting forces.
If you pack the war under the cover of justice, the mask can easily justify the innocent, he warns.
However, the press of the agreed Left remains commendable on the President's side.
The Los Angeles Times, which is still the view that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama, called the address itself for a speaker like him who is known for his talent as a monumental work.
The talk in Oslo "supplys a plan of action to control international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", says the California daily newspaper.
The New York Times is the view that Obama "preached the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "study and exemplary at the same time".
Trainer: Three Marathons for an agreement that ensures the provision of Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the trade unions of the road connection and the TLF - the only organization of workers who remained to the end - came to an end on the freeway to an agreement that put an end to the strike order and the disturbing heavy supply pass to Christmas.
At the signing session on Friday, the State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, agreed to the agreement that was introduced after several weeks of negotiations on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiating parties were hoping to sign the agreement early in the morning.
And although the three employees (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, it will take more than six hours from the beginning of the meeting from 11:00 until the end of the agreement and only 18:00 has been signed.
The conflict "would have added a lot of damage to the company" and "it was to be feared that he would attack the holiday at the end of the year," said Bussereau.
The Agreement provides for a 4% increase in pay for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest pay groups (International transport).
The number of hours for workers with the lowest wages therefore rose from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06.
"That's not very much, but we're just beginning to start a little bit," says Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now advised not to block the supply centres anymore.
"However, there will always be some adversaries who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
The TLF president Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "hard to put these increases in terms of international competition".
As a result, the increase is at 170 euros per month for the low and between 100 and 120 euros for the high pay groups.
"This agreement is based on a healthy human understanding and respect for the employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), although Thierry Duine (CFCC) spoke of "a historical agreement".
In this regard, Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke of "an acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also foresees an increase in travel costs by 3 % and the maintenance of the total road transport service in the first half of 2010, which will in particular enable them to address the topic of 13 months and the modernisation of tariff agreements.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "the decrease in the expenditure for employers of EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the Government to the draft legislation for 2009, which was adopted by the National Assembly on Friday evening.
The government demands "an identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to be first applied to the undertakings associated with this organisation and then to be extended by the Minister of Labour for the whole job.
This will be "in the shortest time" of the case, protected by Bussereau.
The opposition of the employer can only postpone the procedure.
The FNTR's association called for a "distorting trade" because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector in comparison with a part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport urged us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but not to upset the GNP on the next Christmas day, the Unostra regrets.
For the Association Otre, the agreement "the small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry will be able to play a great deal in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disagreements this week, trade unions with the proposals of the RATP
The disturbances on the RR A line, the largest railway network in France for the Paris area and the Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, during a meeting on Friday, the second day between the trade unions and the leadership of the RATP (independent Paris passenger transport administration), will continue to wait for the disputes with their demands for payment.
At this important shopping week before Christmas, no trains were available between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central route (between La Défense and the nation) only one of two trains and only one of four trains was used outside the central course.
The connection to the training of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, which forced travelers to change.
The shopping cart Galeries Lafayette, which counts every day 200,000 customers, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect large businesses in traffic".
The RER A line passes the Paris Ballung area from West to East.
The section of the RATP connects the places Saint-German-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of the two trains traveled on the main road schedule, and almost none during the transport period.
As it was on Thursday, there was no human interest on the streets, as the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had put themselves in the situation.
So early in the morning, the railway station of Saint Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less than anything else, especially because of the lack of Gymnasians.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nkwana, Engineer (29), explained that he would be extra "one-half hours early to get to work".
The SNCF, which had planned a tour of passengers by officials and order forces, showed that there had been no interference in the Saint-Lazare Railway.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of the Cergy-Le-Hout came or went over the Saint-Lazare train station to ensure the connection to the Metros there.
On Saturday and Sunday, major meetings of the strikers took place, while the results were reviewed, which had made the connection after the meeting with the driving stop on Friday afternoon as "debt".
The RER Manager proposed the specific development of a protocol for RER A with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they demand a long-lasting payment.
The CGT claimed that the RATP itself puts its proposal for a loan in clammers and stressed that the driving belt "was not able to solve a problem, while this was also possible in the case of drivers and SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting for the "exclusive examination of working conditions" was to be planned for Monday.
This also shows the association that the company "ignores the weekend driver".
On the morning, about 150 drivers were looking for a committee to be sent to Paris.
After all, it was the lead point that until that date, every discussion during the strike had been rejected, and a meeting was drawn up after a delay in the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict began to expand after an announcement by Usa and Independents on the DER B line.
In addition, the associations require a fee of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents). They also regret the deterioration of working conditions on this route, which are on the daily journey of millions of travellers.
The drivers of the RER line, which have long professional experience over the years, relate to a gross salary of EUR 2,200 to EUR 2,700, as well as an additional salary of EUR 600 to EUR 650 for storage services and sun and holidays.
The Turkish Constitutional Court solves the pro-Curdian party. Decision with severe consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the resolution of the pro-Curdian main party of the country; a decision followed on the ongoing demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision makes it difficult for the Government to put an end to the conflict that has been taking place for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved as it became a "State for Activities that are committed to the independence of the State and its inseparable unity", said President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kilic four days after the press decision.
According to Kilic, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to postpone the resolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the party's leaders, including President Ahmet Turkey and Parliamentary Aysel Tugluk, have been excluded for the duration of five years from the political case.
Furthermore, the judge announced the suspension of parliamentary immunity, Turkey and Tagluk and the confiscating of the interests of the party.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (from 550).
The participants pointed out that Parliamentarians would prefer to leave Parliament rather than take part-sessions.
The decision followed a procedure initiated by the Federal Court of Justice Abdurrahman Yalczinkaya in 2007 and accused the DTP of following the "reliances" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) which is regarded by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organization.
Several observers have the view that the DTP is the legal political watch window of the PKK rebels.
The party ensures that "no connection" to the PKK, however, refuses to appoint it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The judgment of the Constitutional Court is the responsibility of the Government, between the aim of confronting the Kurdish Community and of proposing a number of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds, to allow the support of the PKK to be extended through the Kurds and to put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP confirmed that a resolution could lead to a recurrence of tensions in South-East Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the PKK Chief Abdullah Öcalan had led to meetings with the police over the past few weeks.
Since the court's announcement, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of DTP's rooms in the millions of Diyarbakir city in the south, mostly inhabited by Kurds.
When the demonstrators began to shoot Molotowcocktails and rocks, the order forces set up train-grains and water-drawers.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
Following the judgment, Turkey concluded that the decision of the Court would "improve further doubt".
"Turkey can't explain this (Curdish, e.g. editing) question under the ban of a party," he explained.
The Government, consisting of a party made from the Islamic movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose principle against the conclusion of the parties.
That doesn't solve the problems," said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a turning point in the democratic opening promoted by the government," said political market observer Ahmet Island.
"You can clearly fix a reaction of the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK became known as an attack by seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days ago. It was one of the most brutal attacks of the past month.
The snowfall can come
A really hot winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to get rid of the citizens, says the FES Winter Service Leader.
But so that his staff can test and manage the whole vehicle technology.
On the weekend it could be known as meteorologists for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is following a precise plan.
As soon as it is flat-screened in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-turns with large electric vehicles will be carried out, Brauburger explains.
This includes the main road transport and transit routes, such as the New Road and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire-fighting, ØPNV routes, walking zones and tracks with cases such as the Atselberg Street.
The FES service starts at three o'clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometres had to be stretched for maximum three hours with fatty salt, which was better.
Therefore, the FES starts at three o'clock in the evening, "so that the tracks are free until the traffic starts".
It'll be hard if it's only 7:30 am.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service director, "because no one's ready to take the train instead."
First of all, if it is not so fast, the delivery and development routes, which are also part of the Council-Beil Street, are on the line.
The last priority has side and side streets.
There will be complaints, white Brauburger.
About five o'clock in the morning, the people of the FES will be given priority over the road, danger points and crossings.
For all routes, the FES cannot be concerned most.
In Frankfurt there is a special service that keeps the bridges in mind from 22 to 4.30 hours in particular, says Brauburger.
As it is given on this quick glaze, it is as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the current is going down.
This will also be called by the police if necessary.
The Wounds of the Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other flexible dinosaurs: The two meters long and 1.50 meters wide animal loved on two strong hind legs, had a long injury with scars, buried teeth, short arms with steel crates and a long scarf.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it wouldn't have been special.
But Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science from Thursday.
The animal lived some 215 million years ago in New Mexico today, which was then located in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangéa at the equator.
Tawa opens a new window for early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about relations, the expansion and characteristics of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists started recording on the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes one day we found a dozen dinosaur bones, which is for example for depositions from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified researchers as new species.
In the course of the graduation, they will bring together the rest of the total of five individuals.
Found confirmed theories about dino morning history
The name "Tawa" comes from the Sungate of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary fund: "Dinosourary fossils from the Trias are extremely rare, most of which can only be found individual pieces."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share enthusiastism.
This fund is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of Bonn University.
According to the current opinion, the dinosaurs were first born some 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils, however, are imperfect, why the order of this u-dinos is often disputed.
The experts are discussing, for example, when the Eggs started in their three main development lines: the flux-free thermopods, which were later counted as tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, which were known as the "longhose" species and their associated species, and the plants that were fresher orantischia (fungal beaks) belonging to the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is an original therapist.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
In the disaster of Tawa Hallae, for example, the researchers found indications of airbags, as they also owned the pathogens, the birds.
Thanks to the air bag, the breath of birds is more efficient than that of the mammals.
At the Tawa hallae, the bones of the vibral salt were also apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive therapist with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the associated line of the huge sauropodens later also had air bags and light-building bones, this useful innovation was probably already carried out by the common process of both groups.
At least three migration routes to North America
Because the most famous dinosaurs have ever lived in South America, researchers believe that the eggs were there for the first time.
The three development lines were therefore broken down early and spread from South America over all parts of the world, which were still a single country mass.
The fact is that the team, together with Tawa and the rest of the other two, did not find particularly closely related therapods.
The three cannot derive from a common, intended practice, argument the researchers.
We believe that there were at least three migration routes to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-founder of science study.
There are also objections for freedom.
Another older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a group of dinosaurs, lived in modern Poland, says the Bonner Paléontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could be distorted by the fact that in South America there are only a few primitive dino fossils left, while there is hardly anything to be found on other continents.
As the dinosaurs were able to develop from a relatively rare side line of the Reptilient itself to the dominant agricultural animals of the earth, it is still rare.
During the Trias the dinosaurs shared their living room with many other reptilians, for example with the practices of today's crocodiles and the airsauri and many other lakes.
At the end of the Trias, dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the association at the border of the Trias to the jury died.
Success History won't last forever
There are two hypotheticals to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that would eventually survive the dinosaurs, but the other reptilions would not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could win the competition from the field.
In any case, the success story does not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite attack on a group of animals that had also developed in the Trias, and since that time a treasure hunt has been completed: the sages.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and signatures are international.
Professors of the University Toronto are at the University of Cambridge, the Uni Wien or from Berkeley in California.
Doctors from Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police space of the occupied casino of Frankfurt Goethe University is a world-wide resort.
278 professors and teachers of the Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are solidarity with the protesting students at the Campus Westend.
In a statement in German and English, they are "missible" to the police service carried out by the Bureau.
Uni-President Werner Müller-Estler had left the building occupied by students and teachers in the education sector in the past week, because the walls and works of art were forgotten.
Five students were injured.
The charges, the signatories, did not justify "the violent resolution of self-organised teaching events by students and teachers by a police command".
The space is an "non-acceptable approach" to freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism is "delegation and criminalization of the protest" and links to the content.
The Bureau has withdrawn the necessary speech.
The doctors demand immediate prosecution.
The majority of the owners did not support the damage, that is.
Protest legitimized
The youth of the Verdi Association and the German Association of Trade Unions are also solidarityd with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern about its own future, says Secretary of State Alexander Klein.
Hessen's Ministry of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of the Uni-President and the police.
We are grateful to the Uni-President.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday on Wiesbaden's day.
We have understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, so does the CDU-Agency Officer Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition groups saw SPD, Green and Link.
The CDU takes over the premeditated walls to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Links).
Instead of focusing on the arguments and demands of the students, you have been surprised.
The left has submitted a request to the Interior Minister to report on the police service.
New Silicon-Valley
For years she was a secret city, accessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital city of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, was a strictly guarded place for secret intelligence research.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Moscow center, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production sites for micro and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had contacted Frankfurter Sciences Station Riedberg - with the Union institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several cross-border visits, and on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol for Close Cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Moscow Vice Mayor, Juri Rosljak and President Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd, led the Russian delegation, signed for Frankfurt by planning Lieutenant Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it's also about economic relations.
Companies of the FIZ will be able to catch on the growing Russian market foot.
On the other hand, Russian scientific firms want to make contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of important Russian research institutes and companies.
This includes the Moscow Institute for Electronic Technology, the large companies of Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronica.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist plant town" for the research of the Russian Federation.
Selenograd (meanly translated "Grünstadt") received his name from the administered hospital in which the research facilities are located.
Stuttgart Bremsklotz
The size of Stuttgart 21 may not be high enough.
For the sponsors of the project it is bad and simply "the new heart of Europe".
This is true. S21 is much more than the depth of a railway station, more than a monstrosity building building, which will run the city of the Baden-Württemberg Country Capital city for a decade in a holy construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was created from the spirit of the 1980s.
Headphones with lights ending in the middle of the city were then considered to be trafficous fossils of the 19th century, which acted as the keys to a modern rail traffic, since it took a lot of time to recycle locomotives from behind.
Just keep moving, keep moving - so go.
And that's why the main railway ports should be removed: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a railway station, located about half of the trans-European Ski Magistrate between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, is therefore the slogan of "Lord Europe".
S21 will be actually completed now, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have found that it is almost in the Hessian and Bayeric great city to be able to apply the depth.
However, no more problems of driving and driving, since there are modern trailers with motor vehicles and control cars at both ends.
However: Stutgart 21 is now underway with the ICE neo-neutral line after Ulm.
It has been carried out by national and municipal politicians.
The train is also responsible for the risks of the largest infrastructure individual project in the Republic of the taxpayers and not the public sector.
The project can be remedied in a number of ways.
There is a new city hall, which - you believe the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of greens.
For the rail transport system, S21 is dangerous.
The railway station and the road construction are intended for the traffic of the people, which is typically 80 years of age - a huge growth.
At the time, there was no competition for the ticketer.
Modern transport policy must first, however, strengthen the transport of goods, as transport on the rail is much more environmentally friendly than per Lkw on the road.
However, the new growth is not due to severe increases in the supply of goods.
It is even more serious that S21 is indirectly using many other railway projects.
Good six billion euros are to be banned in the Swabian.
That's the official number.
Experts hold ten to 15 billion for realistic.
It is established that in the next decade, money will be missing from other nodes and closings in the network.
All six larger projects are listed by the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the development of the good 180 km long track through the Rhinetal.
Since 1987 it has been built on the track at the time.
It would be necessary to press right here on the tube.
But S21 will act as a brake lock.
The rail line will be the bottle for international freight: in the heart of Europe.
The Government shall examine the Court of Justice at the airport
On Wiesbaden's day, the Government has opened up whether they will be subject to the review of the case of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) for the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP Coalition has commissioned experts to review the VGH section of more than 400 pages legally, said Economic Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel on that day had written grounds that the country had to re-regulate the night flight ban in the case of the construction of the planned Northwest Land Railway in Frankfurt Airport.
The permit of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as expected by the Government of the country, is not compatible with the legal protection of the population before nightly flights.
The coalition has to decide whether it is against the Court of Auditors by 4 January.
The opposition criticized this move and urged the representatives of the Government to reject a revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD-Frequency Chief Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on CDU and FDP to return to their previous appointment to a night flight ban. Otherwise, it would be considered "wordbreak".
It's fucking hard if you can keep your word, Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir said in play on the FDP election log "We hold word".
Minister Posch showed back the draft of the Säfer-Gübbel that the government is trying to get to their night flights with "law enforcement and tricks".
A precise legal examination takes their time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a more secure decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they reflect the opposition, the statements of his group to the night flight ban have never been made.
U.S. Banks pay back Help
The crisis-affected US large banks break down their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the aid from the Banking Fund Tarp at a total of 45 billion dollars (good 30 billion euros) to a fine.
The Citi group also plans to replace State aid after a report from the US sender CNBC.
The institutions therefore want to reduce the restrictions that have been imposed by the adoption of the money – i.e. the limitation in the payment of managerboni and the correction of higher fees.
The Bank of America had provided 19 billion dollars of fresh money for investment loans.
The rest of the sum took it out of its own box, which was well filled by sales of Sparta.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis expressed his thanks to the middle-aged American tax collector: the money cuts have helped over a very difficult time.
The cash house had risen to the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of Merrill Lynch Investment Bank.
The Citi group also wants to make money on the capital market to be freed from its obligations to the State.
Already on Thursday, the US bank could announce a serious increase in its capital, reported CNBC on circles.
A Citigroup speaker didn't want to go abroad.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their help.
Quick Select
Then everything went faster than expected.
Almost two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors had forced the executive editor Nikolaus Brender out of the office, the sender may present a successor.
Yesterday evening, the panel wanted to vote on the staff.
As a favorite, Peter Frey, head of the ZDF capital studio in Berlin.
However, it was not officially confirmed by the sender to prevent the procedure.
However, it should also have played a role in not further harming the ZDF-intentioned Markus Schachter, nor should this proposal be made at the Administrative Board.
Frey, the applicant, needs the support of nine of the 14 Grammy members.
The outcome of the vote was not yet established at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, the Board of Governors, with its proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years, was split.
Only seven members spoke out for burnter, seven voted against him. Brender's Abbahl was a very low-ranking position for losers, a promising yet.
Because the Union majority in the Board of Directors had already signaled weeks before the election, not wanting to confirm burnters in the office.
The opposition was organised against the chief editor of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under the banner, ZDF's messages had been lost at single rates, he left another official time of the top-level editor.
Therefore, just before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was reduced.
In recent years, even 35 national lawmakers have been involved in the debate, who have appreciated the practice of cooking as a constitutional tool.
It doesn't have anything to do with it.
Personal
Peter Frey was born in Bingen on August 4, 1957.
He studied politics, pedagogical and Romantic.
Then he worked at the Southwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundshaw.
In 1983, Frey changed to the ZDF, first to the today-journal.
Following stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the Chief Editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 Leader and Moderator of the "Morgen Magazines"; until 2001 Head of the ZDF Foreign Policy; since Head of the ZDF Capital Studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the Abbahl Branders, who was selected from the middle-week media magazine to the journalist of the year.
Koxs väderpart of the Administrative Council, President Kurt Beck of the Rhineland-Pfélic Prime Minister, stated last week that the countries should change the ZDF Treaty so that staff proposals of the applicant cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, an exception to party policies from the GEF's supervisory framework was also taken out of beck.
Brender's prospective successor, Peter Frey, had recommended to the Board of Directors with a clear shot - by criticalizing the team immediately after the Brender's strike.
Thanks to this order of journalism, he was able to be nominated both without losing face for the position of the chief editor and the Board of Directors, without suspecting that he would be taken to the office by a participant.
In the partnership, Frey will not be able to count the left liberals.
The study was formed
Partly for the students: After one year of education, the Minister of Culture of the Countries finally joined on Thursday: at a meeting of the Minister of Culture and Higher Education Conference, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions at Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
In each case, they agreed to reduce the test load: basically, each study module should conclude only with a single test.
In addition, the work load of the students should be reviewed and "a realistic and representative measure" should be ensured.
In addition, politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of examination services between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to developing common structural objectives for Bachelor and Master Studies more flexible.
In addition, different national arrangements should not be provided.
Fewer tests
Since the beginning of student protests in June, the Ministers of Culture and Uni-Rectors have taken the flight from the best student availability in their mouth.
Now it was first filled with a specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Board decided to partially reduce the number of tests: "Each module usually ends with only one test", which means in a 30-page paper which will partially re-regulate the approval of studies.
With the "significant reduction of the test load", the Accreditation Council President Reinhold Grimm explained that a "female development content which significantly affected the student's ability" should be offered.
In addition, the "studyability" should be "the decisive criterion" in the design.
Modules like content are "to check hard at this", whether "unnecessary consents of students when selecting the
Events" would be avoided.
The students would have "Require to get toys to enable and promote their own initiatives".
The rules should be new to the authorisation, but also to the examination of existing studies.
These must be "recorded" every five years, however, which means that it will last until 2015 until all studies have been checked.
It is also responsible for ten accreditation agencies which support the accreditation board established by the countries.
The Ministers of Culture had called on the countries in October "with night pressure" to influence the agencies that the dust levels are not too large and the test regime is not too strict.
In individual Federal countries universities and universities with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have already taken appropriate measures.
As a single country, Rheinland-Pfalz said that additional resources were needed for the further development of the Bologna process.
In particular, higher education programmes should be set up for higher education and training, as well as for training and abroad.
Countries and universities want ten million euros to be used for this.
In early 2010, the government wanted to introduce a novel of the Higher Education Act to Parliament.
After this, only one test should be necessary for the conclusion of a study model.
The study plan should be more flexible, as well as the recognition of performance indicators at other universities and facilitate access to the Master.
Up to the end of the coming years, all studies in the country should be examined on their studyability.
On Thursday, the government and opposition had again argued about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to Lob, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Presidency of the Juso High School Groups called for the development of education policy to be no longer "closed doors" of the ministers and high schools.
At the end of the course of education, the students should now also say "a word".
The future academics received support from the President of the High School Rector Conference (HRK), Margaret Wintermantel: "We need students' experiences," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Culture Ministers, with which the HRK is preparing a joint reform paper.
The trade union education and science (GEW) did not go far enough: it requires a legal claim that enables each graduate with a Bachelor degree to have access to a continuing master’s education.
On the other hand, the countries need to ensure that there are sufficient master's facilities with the best study conditions available for today's generation of Bachelor students, such as Andreas Keller, GEW member.
The countries must clearly set up more doctors.
However, the Minister of Culture did not extend free access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Enter Germany and out there is almost no control..." the initial line of a poem of Lyrik's Werner Söllner, in which in destructive language the experience of a dissident who has gained freedom, has lost his language.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's bookstore, before he moved to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prices, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurter Poetik advantages at Goethe University, and has been the leader of the Hessian Literature Forum in the Mouson Tower in Frankfurt since 2002.
He spent the last Tuesday at a meeting in Munich, where he went about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror of their security acts".
Apparently, Söllner made and left a statement in which he, in front of Roman-German fellows, included Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, appointed his partner as IM for the Romanian Secret Service Security.
Söllner, together with some of the residents, had received the German language price in 1989.
The application tests had begun badly, first in 1971.
I'm, in conclusion, "so someone who hasn't threatened himself enough against the temptation of security."
The Lyriker Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
At the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and their unambiguous literary representation with the dictatorial regime mechanisms, the literature chain, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, will be shaken by a case that exposes the reasons and the subversiveness of a political system based on monitoring and scrutiny.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say, not only the victims, but also the victims.
In his Security Act, IM Walter played a role, said according to the opinion of the literary scientist Michael Markel, and referred to the positive influence of the IM Walter had on him.
He's got him at all difficult points for him at the time, so Markel.
It would be a moral necessity for him to make this remark.
In this form and before this publication, however, the knowledge of an former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not surprising.
If Germany had been a comfortable reservation for security spare parts, Herta Müller had already written in July, after reading her own document, 914 pages.
In some cases, the people concerned may be confused and may have also been aware of whose name behind the cover names Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the country in which we are engaged in the very secure protection of the Stasi acts, the treatment with the security surveillance frameworks is still very widespread.
A systematic declaration has been withdrawn and stopped in recent years.
One of the Birthler authorities of the National Council for the Preparation of Security Acts (CNSS) was established only in 1999, but the publication of the Act was rather slow.
Only since 2005 there has been a law governing the administration of the acts.
That the influence of former security members in Romania was still very high, following the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, an interview in which a former security chief from Temesvar took part in the awards.
She's got a psychosis. Finally, you've just heard it once.
The infamity of power here seemed to be completely unsatisfied in the design of freedom of thought.
Of course, in the case of debt, as often as in relation to a moving debt, there are inevitable questions.
The special reaction of the members of the Söllners can be hoped that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by knowledge rather than by education and shame.
For the Genesis of the work of Herta Müller, which opposed the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Settling Schedule Champions League
It turned out that just as an adretted outdoor servant from a very nice Christmas party on which a sports artist, Goodies, had distributed it when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange-colored plastic sheet of the equipment, rose a quarter hour after midnight in a high-level C-class.
The man with the brandy glazed himself because he was still in a foreign city.
Otherwise, he could also drive himself - alcohol was not in the game at all, and, luckily, the 55-year-old was quite little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work goes on.
Or just let go of it.
In the words of the first three days before the Swiss committed: "We have reached the end of the final", namely in the League champions, thanks to the 3:1 success of Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blind from the success: there will be a brutal fight against the decline."
The "very important task" is before Sunday.
Then it is appropriate to resume the royal service in Mainz on the day of the League.
And remove the ever-opened weaknesses after the fast three gates through Marica (5.), Tresch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Expiration
The final end of the Champions League (Hinspiele 16./17. + 23/24 February/ Returns 9./10. + 16/17 March) will be released in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy over the fulminant attitude of the Babel followers remained.
Not only in the relative health sector, but also in the short term, it has provided the unsecured Stuttgart's profession with self-confidence, readiness and fun.
I went to the players and told them that they should think about their strengths, and had kept them to be braver, explained the brain cramping big that just sounds so exciting, but it had no effect under the therapy of Babbelle.
He's got a certain magic, given Babel-Purtor Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in the football, sometimes things that you wouldn't have been able to keep."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a week-long break thanks to his dynamics as well as the best player on the spot, tried to describe the established "penomims" with the verbal "fresh wind" and the way of the new crew: "He's a man who goes through and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
Under Babel, it had clearly been cursed.
The VfB Stuttgart is still not over the mountain, warns sports president Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs a lot of constitution.
Like Gross, the players and managers would also want to overestimate the victory against a weak and completely overwhelmed reverse of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgov, four days later in Liverkus at 0:4 the bad awakens, Khedira thought.
And sports president Horst Heldt said that although a seasonal goal had been achieved, the other was still in the distance.
We're not over the mountain yet.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday, even after his first home page, has not been celebrating for three months, was the events of the weekend that were alive in the form of a television interview published immediately before the start of the game by Torhüter Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that the others make and not the Jens, Heldt told the harsh criticism of Lehmanns.
The Board had proposed leadership deficits and had decided to change the training on pressure of puberty fans.
Also that his free day was spent after games, Lehmann was valued as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and mistrust.
Lehmann's statements were "compelled by pure egoism", Heldt returned and announced consequences for the final man.
They'll probably not be friends for life anymore, the two of them are four years old.
However, they agreed with everyone else that it would not have been possible without the negotiations by the decoupled training team to play and fight hard.
Babbelle and his assistants would have "a great part of success", said Heldt and Lehmann unisano - and also the man with the plastics.
WM-Fight in Weight
Today's Duell in Bern: again and again challenging Kevin Johnson World Master Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
However, after 12 hard rounds, the Ukrainians protected his heavyweight title after the WBC version.
The judgment of the Court of Justice was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains a box-world master in heavy weight.
The 38-year-old champion, after the release of the WBC, visited the US-American Kevin Johnson on Saturday evening in Bern unanimously on points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko, it was the third successful title defense after its comeback in October 2008.
The Ukrainians were already two World Masters of the Associates WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't happen to the K.o. that everyone expected.
Klitschko built his balance on 39 victories in 41 professional battles, twice he had to pay for injuries.
In the 24th fight, challenging Johnson had to take the first download.
About 17,000 visitors in Berner Arena wanted to dictate the fight, especially with his left hand.
The 11 centimetre smaller Johnson, who had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko-Éra before the duel, however, was still able to escape the scourges of the Master of the World, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights to a decisive end.
Overall, the passive Johnson did little for a challenger and tried only to get through the rounds.
Although he practiced klitschko with words and gestures, his beats only rarely met the master of the world.
However, he was only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went through the full distance of twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had taken care of some of the violence in the Swiss capital before the battle.
He trained Klitschko as "haasal zombie", which "can't be right".
At the beach, the champion then made an effort on Friday to take Johnson's sunglasses off his nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory by Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko also survived in his fourth battle after his return on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years, he had killed the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and returned his "his" WBC-Girtte, which he had to give before fighting.
In this year, he was forced by Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States in September.
In this fight, I just got a shot and I'm physically very well in shape, Klitschko had established the quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the World Master of the Linked WBO and IBF.
However, the WBA's bridge is carried by British David Haye after he was able to unload the 2,13 - foot tall Nikolai Wallujew in November.
Haye had earlier said a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September in the summer.
Apparently its promotion company is already planning the fight against Klitschko in London Wembley Stadium.
Fall Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Grüren-Fraktions Chief Jürgen Trittin has named Minister of Defence Guttenberg as a liar for false information about Kunduz-Affère.
SPD and links require clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - Following recent findings on the air attack by Kunduz, the opposition Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor to Guttenberg (CSU) has submitted a conscious increase.
The minister said of the murder bombing on two tank trains from September "very the truth," said Green Group chief Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD message "Dayview".
It's called the earthquake: He lied.
The order to kill has been issued under the failure of the rules of the International Defence Forces for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that NATO had read by Mr Guttenberg said Trittin.
On Friday, it was announced that the attack was not only to destroy the exported cargo, but also to kill two Taliban leaders.
According to the Nato investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured when the German Kunduz commander, Colonel Klein, called for the US attack.
Greens, SPDs and links called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to explain immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of the intended death is part of the Afghan government's policy of Afghanistan - and whether Chancellor, Federal War and News Service have authorized this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green College Renate Kunast called for this new strategy.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm showed the criticisms decided back.
The Chancellor did not influence the specific provisions of the Federal War in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the reasons for the resignation of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to the information provided by the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have been informed correctly and fully on the basis of the tanker approach.
Officially, it was clear that they had established the existence of the Nato reports and kept the Minister aware of the details.
However, in the context of the two senior officials, it was reported that they had even referred to several reports from the Ministry of Defence, including a two-year document of the commander, Colonel Klein and a field guard report.
In a letter asking for clarification of the case, the "Frankfurter General Journal of Sunday" reports.
He didn't get an answer until he got it.
On Saturday, the Ministry did not object to the proposals and pointed out that this would be made clear in the committee of examining the Bundestag that wanted to establish itself next Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some see pictures and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in mental illnesses and in drugs, the boundaries between imagination and reality have been eliminated.
As long as it happens in sleep, it's all right.
If we are with closed eyes in our dark rooms, we can immediately introduce the most wild ideas and imaginations.
However, those who experience traumatic conditions in the growing world see and hear things that others do not see or hear, in the modern Western world, are often considered crazy or sad, at least as special.
However, such images and voices do not exist only in mental illnesses or in drugs.
We must have our imagination: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint images or write novels make it possible to break the boundaries between dream, noise and reality.
Surprisingly changed alert perceptions can occur in the most diverse forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case Wahn.
Even if there is a difference between divorce and effect, the visions of mystiker Hildegard of Bingen, the experiences of the New Age Prophet Carlos Castaneda, the shaman withdrawal condition, psychosis and hallucinations, can be traced back to similar processes.
Halluzinations or visual representations occur when the equivalent of the neuronal nutrients of the brain - all in front of dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholin - is balanced and the interaction of the various parts of the brain is impaired.
Complex hallucinations and tired thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The force has no power over him.
The relationship of Wahn and Dream has been in the hands of philosophers and doctors since the Antiques.
Aristotle saw Halloween as a form of dream in the wake of the state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, observed in 1861 a "great similarity of Irish to dream status", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the indigentities, drawings, meanings of such a kind".
It is Herbst 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and quiet.
The force has no power over him, he moves to the room deck.
He's going to take a trip.
Behind him fled demons with blue-headed, confused brothers, likesy.
They hunt him, they beat him with heavy, flimsy sticks, they beat him against the walls, he smells the pain all over the body.
Sounds, bad voices flow out of walls and radio.
He can no longer ask them to vote in favour of him and to recommend him.
Henning T. gets two cables from the stereo system, she goes to a sledge and confirms it on a hook at the deck.
He's standing on a speaker and he's sitting around the neck.
Springt.
The Schlings are getting rid of it.
That should be a lesson to you, the voices cry in a trumpet blast, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today is Henning T. 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last is 2 years back, the first nearly 20 years.
It was dissolved by LSD.
His diagnosis is due to schizophrenia, manic depression, manic depression, depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In the psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deep confusion, he says.
The draw images are glaucoma reality
Almost one percent of the population gets sick at least once in life at Schizophrenia, and in psychiatric clinics, it is treated as the second most common after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, the victims may no longer differ between the inner and outer world, which may lead to hallucinations, sizes, relationships or persecution.
The voice is particularly widespread - voices that order, comment or dialogue.
Even optical hallucinations are not rare.
The important thing is that the brain can no longer be separated from anything important, the brain can no longer filter disruptive signals, the consciousness is overcome by impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the keys to a stream of ideas and fantasies that generate deeper consciousness.
The reality perception in the psychosis is subjective, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, of the General Psychiatry Clinic at Heidelberg University.
The scissor is located in the center of the event, everything has a meaning to it.
At the same time, he plays a passive role, he becomes, like in the dream, overcomes the events and can't actively design them.
Therefore, scissors often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality comparison is usually not possible for them, the dry images are grazy reality, shutting down.
Once in life, having experienced a hallucination
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the emotional and spatial structure of the reality that will be taken into account in the psychosis remains fundamental."
The real thoughts and hallucinations were in reality, and the promotion of life took place within the real framework.
Why exactly does our brain beat caprioles, researchers still stand in front of advice.
Exceptions can lead to short-term loss of reality in every person, Fuchs says.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic arrangement for schizophrenia, but volunteers have shown that genes are not the only factors.
Researchers suggest that there are minimal brain damage.
We suspect that neuronal replication of the brain is impaired in an early stage of development, for example, by a mother's viral disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But there remains a clue as to how the neuronal system's deterioration will occur, which will not even manifest itself for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be a solver for a psychosis when available.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis as they penetrate the transmission system.
When Our Heart Is Hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer under their hallucinations and switch expensive drugs to release them, other money for drugs to get what to get, says Professor Erich Kasten, Lübecker.
Whether to detect dry images as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a question of the position.
Casten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and droughts for ten years, and last year he has assessed his results in the book "The Real World in Our Head".
Halluzinations include the typical appearances of psychosis, but also of many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as Borderline or depression, patients such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s disease are often also affected.
Surprisingly, the brain of healthy people is hallucinated under certain conditions.
Halluzinations, such as cassettes, are together from memory content that are normally kept.
They occur when hirnareales in which thoughts are processed are overactive or less secreted; when our brain is hot or when there is no stimulation.
Drug use can solve this condition exactly like brain damage or a psychosis.
But also travel, stress, love room or other mental exceptions.
In younger studies, up to a third of the respondents had at least once in their lives experience a hallucination.
In summer 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visiting the Gymnasium there.
A very normal girl, actually.
If it wasn't for pictures and voices.
In the pause it may occur that a smart young man with long, dark hair fits it.
When he is answered, the students look at it wonder - no one else sees or hears these boys.
They keep the cute girl for a busy dayroom, but Sarah K. doesn't dream she knows.
She's awake, she hears and sees these guys, just like she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to herself.
She can even smell her presence, at least for a moment.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boys.
When I'm crazy, she sometimes asks herself.
But she knows that this young man and the other dragon images are not real and disappear again.
Nights are most touching
Often the drum images are also a burden.
If she sits in the classroom, she can't follow the teaching material at times because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears, while explaining mathematical equations for all others to hear and see on the table.
Nights are most touching.
When she waits in her dark room on the bed, which is too rare and too late, she can often not discern whether she is awake or is asleep, whether the pictures she sees, the brothers or the girls with the bleeding cuts on arms and legs, in front of their open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at the designers.
Parents and friends do not tell them anything about what they would think they're crazy.
Herbst 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
In the past year, she has lived the Abitur and lives with her friend.
One year ago, the Hallusions stopped.
Since she's been in contact with the psychologist's caste on the Internet, she knows exactly that she's not crazy.
Which is also an art work of doubt
If a person is socially isolated or is suffering from depression, he is likely to have a long history of hallucinations, says Casten.
I suspect that the brain is then under-employed and will take care of itself for its maintenance.
Sarah K., a single child, as a little girl feared other children, often played alone.
Her Hallusions began when she learned with 13 that the man she calls her father, since she can think, is not her loyal father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain, which also deal with real impressions and noises, it happens to distinguish between such things as Sarah K. difficult, dry images and reality. "Every experience," says Casten, "finds in the brain, the reality emerges from there.
Halluzinations are also images that make the brain appear so real."
Night dream images also value castles as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of health are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to scisophrene, mental health is able to recognize their dry images as unrealistic.
It is therefore important for his patients to appreciate the hallucinations as well as their special capacity.
Distance between sleep and Hallusation
In our highly consciously-centred world, imaginary experience is unfortunately pathologically pathological, says Michael Schmidt Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chief of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a difficult, painful disease, but it also produces positive, creative - which is also an art work of confusion.
Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the so-called ionoid experience, a special form of the marvelously changed alertness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi dreams that keep the survivors real and that can't be different from the state of wakefulness.
The ionoid awareness condition occurs in extreme conditions of trauma or illness, for example in patients with polyracydiculitis who experience motor impairment in full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by self-destruction and world loss, i.e. by persistent, complete mobility, he replaces the life-threatening reality with a own, imaginary world that is driven by reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of barrier between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to deal with a situation in reality, there is a world change, but the reality is being ignored in imagination.
An intense form of thought and feeling in an inconceivable situation that enables us to create our own beings is not subject to any loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zürcher Artist Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book "Development" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years of age, when his consciousness takes place after a heart attack operation with subsequent heart transplantation on trips, while his body is being judged on the intensive care station.
Clossen falls into a self-sustained world, visiting foreign times and places: He lives as a bedridden, old man, on the board of a train examiner, a robot is waiting for his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages under algae, which produces the extracts from blood.
He was thrown by a Greek on the motorcycle in his home country, survived with his hospital bed in the branch of the Alps and met a Korean Mafioso.
It goes on completely in the imaginary case, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These internal journeys vary considerably from one dream to another.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are obvious to me after years and in further detail.
More clear and more intense than real experience.
The intensity of this experience spreads the horizon of our other world experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt Degenhard.
Last end shows Oneiroide, psychosis, hallucinations, and drugs, how useful our internal images of external reality are also in the wake.
Every change of consciousness, says the psychologist Casten, "can lead to a transformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be overwhelming.
The snowfall can come
Burda
Children are expected to take over the legacy at 27 years of age
The new director of the D.C. Callen is an intermediate solution: In the long run, Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told the SPIEGEL.
The Holding will also include 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The landlord Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children for a long time.
Both children grow up at 27 years of age and have the firm's strong will to join the company, said the 69-year-old SPIEGEL.
The details of this have been carefully regulated.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is this first question.
The question is whether they are in a position to do so.
It is not possible to provide 7500 employees with their children if they are not adequately qualified.
This also brings the children around and the company.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he was withdrawing from the president of the Board from January, and Paul-Bernhard Callen appointed his successor.
The 52-year-old Callen has been a member of the Board of Directors at Burda since 1999.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury area, the responsibility for the company's assets came to it and after the separation of Jürgen deathhöfer also came to direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, there is no family member at the top of the ship.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, today 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The name of Callen also means "10, 15 years," as Burda said.
The Holding should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda said.
Looking at the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family companies are not safe before the event: "It is always about families who are exposed to a capital search that has been completely mirrored and thought that they could rise to such a huge player.
My strategy wasn't that.
He's had "new world power dreams," Burda.
I do not see myself as the political president of this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to play 'Time' in the world, these countries have become too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in view of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
This is at least what El Corte Inglés has done, who recently opened a cargo business with a area of more than 1000 m2im shopping centre in Callao (Madrid), in which everything is only about body care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, you can find among other companies, such as Hedonai, which provides for relaxation with lasers; Spaxion, space for relaxation and beauty treatments; the Friseur Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a fitness studio or L'Occitane with its natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food distribution that is more than 130 different kinds of teasing in its tea house.
A relaxing massage together with your partner to have a fantastic view of the main city at the same time, or for two hours to rent the relax area to put your own "beautiful party" on your feet with eight friends and then to relax in the Whirlpool or with massages and a glass champagne, these are just a few of the opportunities that Spaxion offers.
The total area is 250 m2 divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments and hydrotherapy.
For example, for the cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The fitness studio also has this kind of equipment, and there are also virtual coaches who care about the training units of customers and offer them a complete personal training.
You start a training unit by entering a personal password on a touch screen that is opposite the devices.
Then show you various videos how you perform your training units correctly.
The director of the fitness studio ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and cooling) are fully sufficient to train the body muscles.
If you refuse after you have trained your body, even at the Friseursalon, the company Luis & Tachi has a room that is offered in the treatment for the recovery of hair, glasses and health for your hair in a personalised way.
Innovation and exclusion seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at 365 days a year.
The most diverse Decollets
Christmas is becoming ever closer and therefore it is a good opportunity again to copy the appearance of stars and to take their tight clothes into our clothes.
The form of the Decolleté, which is very important for the preference of Silhouette, is one of the points to be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen a highly sophisticated and highly complicated decolleté. It can only be opened.
Endesa and Barcelona with the electric car
The power company Endesa has created the "LIVE Office" together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project for the development and promotion of electric cars in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (Logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car into the city and reach agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is just to be developed to promote the electric car and the opinions and actions of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport for the future.
3 "electric cities"
Barcelona, however, is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also participate in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to speed up the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote research and technological development activities in the autonomous Community of Catalans.
These activities include such activities as energy and, in particular, their performance.
However, it is not the only initiative at the endesa to participate in the promotion of the electric car.
The company is involved in standardisation groups across Europe and has a whole range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VALUE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of peace" for the car sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesied the Spanish car industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of peace".
In the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report by the Presidents of the Government, Zapatero once again reminded the authorities of the measures taken to support the automotive sector during the government's year.
"Without the Autoindustrial competitiveness plan, today we had a panorama of the closure and the collapse of some of our main production works," the President of the Government said.
"Because of this plan and the readiness of the car manufacturers, even in Spain, to produce a very competitive industry, we can see a peaceful horizon for the future of this industry, which is our major export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the competitiveness plan, which is part of the total car industry (PIA), has provided €800 million for projects of 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which also provided for investments of more than €3 billion.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also underlines the Government's efforts to address the demand, in response to the 2000E plan, which will be applied in cooperation with the autonomous communities and car manufacturers.
According to the Head of Government , this plan allows the emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market to be reduced by 6 % to the average, resulting in a "strong increase" in authorisations which increased by "40 per cent" in November.
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first edition of the international classic car fair is held, an exhibition for professionals and lovers of the world of motors.
This exhibition will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Palbón de Crystal of Casa de Campo in Madrid.
In addition, 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors are placed on an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters.
This includes not only classic motor vehicles and vehicles, but also all items that are only thought to be found in relation to the world of motors in the ClassicAuto Madrid.
In this way you can find exhibitors on the exhibition accessories, spare parts, parts, ingredients accessories, accessories, publications, miniuratos etc.
Hundreds of articles from the world of classical motors that attract collectors and lovers.
Among the companies involved in this show are other Classicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restorations; cupe-Françoiso Pueche, sale and restoration of cars, specializing in Mercedes Benz.
Sendness test in the area of the area
In addition, the sales activities at this fair are supplemented by parallel events: fairings, exhibitions of sports vehicles, Sendness Tests, events and competitions.
There will also be a send-test with classic cars and motorcycles on a self-adhesive race track in the outer area of the exhibition area.
Mazda3 i-stop: Environmentally legitimate sport
Mazda wants to prove that sport is mutually compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda has recently introduced the automatic stop and start system of the engine, which is based on the name i-stop, a device that is currently available only for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
This second generation of Mazdas 3 comes up with their good notes in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its flow behaviour, the mechanical, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" at the new Mazda3.
At the front seats it can be found that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good standing.
In addition, the game of the left-hand wheel is excellent.
In further consideration of the unit consisting of the instrument board and the armature board, it can be found that Mazda is red and blue with a multitude of buttons and buttons in the above-mentioned colors, along the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic design.
This style reminds us partly of the style of Honda Civics.
Therefore, it can be said without exception that both the Mazda 3, as well as the Civic, both Japanese models, are superior to the integrity of the German motor vehicle, especially the Golf people who want to overcome all.
The trainway of these two Japanese compact vehicles offers more comfort than ever, so that four adults can drive too easily with the car.
To all of this, there is a spacious and clearly shaped coffee room.
The stop and start system is currently available only for the 2 litre of petrol engine with 150 PS and a 6-gauge switch.
This engine is a real pleasure. It comes out of its charm, its low noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who don't drive many kilometers a year should take into account this i-stop with a petrol engine because of its grave comfort in driving and its low consumption, even though in Mazda, in particular, the diesel models are most sold.
With regard to equipment, the so-called model sportsve selected for the test is a special feature, since it has a significantly larger number of elements from the series equipment.
The series equipment consists mainly of the driver switch (RVM), which removes the dead angle, but also the components for the traction and stability, the speed adjustment, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the board computer with a large screen, the sensors to park, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and the damaged 17-inch wings.
Moreover, this version also includes, if it is not yet equipped enough, the Premium package, which contains additional 1,500 euros: in addition to additional elements in particular the learning bixenon scanners and the audio system BOSE with CD loaders.
Error
The Mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one of the best compact cars in his class.
It is particularly significant in relation to the materials used, due to its behaviour and the variety of equipment.
Moreover, those who do not have many kilometres a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
The only negative of this model is its somewhat high price, which is between EUR 21.770 for the model Luxury and EUR 23.270 for the model that is tested for sport.
However, the Mazda3 offers us every day at this high price on the new highest train pass.
A premium with a lot of glamour
L. A. rounds out the red carpet of sensitivity for Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premium of "Nine" the stars shot, dressed in models that look just as elegant as sexy, more so. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as always, chose for a dark "Lady" dress.
The Promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which you can only read his emails, without having the opportunity to see some attachments or surf through the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of rest when it chose Time magazine to one of the products of the year.
It's more unlikely to see the tragedy, but the idea of itself is especially for young people of interest.
In contrast to the smartphones, Peek costs only very little and has a very expensive flatrate, for example only half of the price of an iPhone flat.
After seeing the success of the company, two new devices have been placed on the market: one that is meant only for Twitter, the other with a life-long thanks service for data, in contrast to Peek, where you have to pay a six-fold higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this discovery and therefore its third version.
It has the same boundaries as its American opponent, however, has prepared a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the telephone, about 12 euros per month, includes roaming for Europe as a whole.
Those who travel with a smartphone around the world already know what it means to forget all the data in order to be able to read his email once you have crossed the country's border or if you have doubts about a coffee with WIFI (or a connection with background).
The idea of rooming with flatrate is unbelievable and should actually be possible for a long time.
It has already been agreed that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for foreign content, but after my experience, you need a doctorate in physics and a good mirror to read all the little prints.
The repeated criticism by the European Commission in terms of sufficient roaming rates for Europe as a whole is almost always ignored.
Beyond your own country, you are always afraid to read his e-mails and that is right.
That a small device such as FonPeek (though it is always amazing that it has the name of the Fund, although it does not have Wifi/WLAN) can offer this type of tariffs, means that the telephone providers need to think slowly but safely and start taking different possibilities into account how they can use their network.
Kindle is another good example for this, in its prices the download of books and other questions on the Internet is included.
No vet and no hacks.
This is a device that is available on the Internet and only once a month is paid for it, i.e. when buying, and not a month for a month.
And that's exactly what I'm expecting one day from FonPeek, a shopping opportunity with live internet access like it already offers Peek in the United States.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my e-mails with the phone, thanks.
But I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for consumers.
It would be interesting, though, to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Gelb is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already at Barack Obama's office as president of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and has again chosen the same color to accompany him at his most important moment in his life: the award of the peace Nobel Prize in Oslo.
Michele Obama has made very similar models at both stages: above all, it was almost the same color - a bright green -, the garment was made of three parts - dress, jacket and mantel from the same fabric, and then she wore something gravely painted or a necklace.
It is even as if at first glance it seemed that the first Lady of the United States wanted to follow the image of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress at more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes are very different in the fabric from which they are made.
When the office was introduced, she wore a dress from the top and in Oslo a sample of a Samt.
The accessories were also different: for the first time, green shoes with semi-trailers and for the second time, although an independent model, but gold colors.
Also, the hair was different: the hair was raised as hair-kranz at this occasion, when the hair was first opened.
75% of working mothers have problems with their motherhood at work
Discrimination at work has taken place in recent years, especially in younger women who want children.
As a result, the study carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women in Spain "Fruitability and Careers of Women in Spain".
The survey of 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years of age is no doubt: 75% of women who are employed see their career opportunities in the labour market as a result of their motherhood.
The study shows that there are serious differences in the decision to establish a family and the number of children is given, whether they work or not and whether or not they are employed.
Those of them who do not perform any other work outside the house, work only half a day or have no fixed employment contracts, will be more mothers and have more children.
On the contrary, women with a firm attitude, especially in the public area, are divided into families and mothers and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years of age with stable employment receive their first child on average only 3.7 years after the ratio, an increase of 4.1 years for women with stable employment, who have been required to achieve this and who have joined them and the first child has been made a lot later.
Moreover, the nature of work also has a serious influence on motherhood, although less than the calendar on the preparation of reception," explains CSIC-Forscher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that needs to be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the age at the time of marriage and the first child is so much higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be determined in women's age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, each time they had only primary education or higher education, were averaged by 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time to mother.
Moreover, according to their level of education, there is another difference between women.
While the women with the main end-of-life are already married before their first pregnancy and have their first child, it makes women with a middle or high-school education quite different from this, and only seek a first-class marriage and then get their first child, Delgado is established.
Diane Kruger is worth it too
L'Oréal Paris has recently added a new name: Diane Kruger.
The next year, the German actor will be the image of different brand products and also the popular advertising review "Why you deserve it".
The main producer of "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant players at international level, will become another famous exhibition, as has already been before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Funda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before them were the last to join this exclusive club the players Evangeline Lilly ("lost") and Frieda Pinto ("Slumdog Millionaire").
In men, the cosmetic company also has only exceptional writers: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey ́s Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (play fellows of Evangeline in "Last").
The price allocation of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to say in the model world.
Their top representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met the annual price award held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
At this stage, they all appeared.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen for the best model this year.
The poker game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, photos of Fernando Vicente) the three-dimensional drawings of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
He does not use predictable and imaginative genes (Curzbiography, life and work), but he seeks to find a possibility for the happy heart of the Creator.
The trip is exciting and Vict spart neither to cracks nor lightings.
The fact that this book is a delicious reading exercise is also a moving invitation to read and read again.
Here are some sections from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When I read his page, I found out that the Mediterranean is no sea, but rather a spiritual, almost meaningful mode, just as I have always found it, without finding words: the joys in contrast to the insatiable destiny, the moral without guilt and the innocence without any God".
About Samuel Beckett: "Nikhist, allegorical Christ, wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, had, between ignorance and ignorance, with a surrounding poetic humor, without any sense, like the muscles that had almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was led by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirty years, but in her band, in whose flesh the emotions were joined by the joy of reue, a spiritual privilege, which consisted of coming to heaven at the end of the torment."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was released in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000 Gipples in the world's literature, and you have to climb northward, on the wall where the best mountain climbers ever try again."
About William Faulkner: "There was a comedian cause.
Sometimes he said about himself that he would inherit a good owner of the graveyard and again he said that he would be the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams testify to a certain greatness."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took the decisive step that was taken from a bridge from his personality from Munich, so that his echo to the night of the 20th century would fall into his literary form and manner. This he did on a trip he himself swung on and with a talk of full violence against the Würmmers.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled down and prayed: my honored God, I beg you to do everything in your power so that I finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses are engraved by Spencer: 'the sleep after the effort,/ after the wind of the port,/ the peace after the war,/ after a set of lives you will find death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her bag, she always had her depression.
The husband accepted it with full normality when she told him that Edward VII was spying on them between the Azaleen or singing the birds in Greek.
There is no other case known where the man was so patient and loved in a neurotic, whose literary talent was still much bigger than their madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What made Martín-Santos, then, more than trying to escape Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet mean when he didn't lead Baroja into the arms of Faulkner?
What did Cella do to destroy the peace of this man so that he could put himself on this pothole?"
Feige Aggression
My 70-year-old mother went through our village in the village of Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age lived beside her and our dog, our dog is a mixling that we have taken out of the animal, which is just six kilos away from the sky, and then took two feet from here and injured him.
Our equipment can't even be taken in words, as it is incomprehensible to us, because the spaspas is supposed to be a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was naturally executed on the leine.
In addition, when a woman who went through a comfortable space came to justify these people because of the incident, she was afraid even of her own life, because if such a hunter attacks a dog, he will probably do the same with a woman, a child, an older lord or perhaps even anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event took place in a normal quiet city district about five o'clock afternoon on a very regular day of service.
The dog's got a long shot all day.
Of course, we have replaced the announcement in a nearby police station, but we have strong doubts about whether this will ever be done and to prevent any benefits from the beginning, we just want to clarify that the very criminals were Spain.
Our opposition to the incident has forced us to show this case.
We cannot understand what must happen in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal, a animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect have remained with animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvil together for the use of the Helms
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has called for a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially in younger motorists, as both companies have reported today.
This initiative therefore seeks to highlight the importance of the use of helmets, as it is ultimately the only protection element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motor accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to transport safety, which "is far more than just the design and manufacture of products that will always be safer with each day" and further confirmed that they also contribute with other actions to the goal of bringing this goal closer to one day.
This new campaign for the promotion of the helm use on the bike running under the slogan 'To be or not to be' will be distributed in a first phase on over 500 motorcycle stations to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that transport safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and just because it is always required to be a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles, one of its main objectives must be the development of safer products.
The sale of small trucks is increasing slightly again.
After almost two years, the car market for small carriers finally begins to see something light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles allowed in Spain in November mean an increase of 12.6% in terms of 2008 and, more importantly, they are the number of the first growth, with a steady return of 22 consecutive months, compared to the figures submitted by the manufacturer’s Anfac and the car dealer’s Ganvam.
However, these good figures are currently only to be taken seriously, since the reference data referred to as compared to November 2008, which was a particularly bad sales year with a decrease of 60 % in the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total allowances for these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous business year.
Since January 95.853 vehicles have been sold in total, but in this number all vehicles from which the small transporter market consists are included: trailers of passenger cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small vehicles and light trucks/cars.
Moreover, the same weather clouds in the sky are still the same demand in most cases, because even if some of the vehicles of private persons are purchased, the bulk of the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises that operate the purchase with a third funding in almost 100 % of all cases.
It is therefore necessary to address these limitations, which are the consequences of the financial burden imposed by credit institutions, with other factors, such as rising unemployment rates or increasing the share of the poor economy.
In this panorama and in contrast to the passenger cars, financial support has helped to buy a vehicle from the 2000E Plan.
However, this plan is not only for private individuals, but also for self-employed and small enterprises, if they are able to buy a small carrier up to 3.5 tons of CO2 emissions, which cannot exceed 160 grams per kilometre of risk, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Recently, Ganvam had reminded himself that it is absolutely necessary from the state to turn a special focus on this small truck as well as, of course, on industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The car trader association predicts a similar year for the year 2010 as it just lasts 19 % of the sales volume (in the case of passenger cars and land vehicles).
Support in critical situations is now mandatory
As is already happening with the ABS anti-block brake system and as it is currently happening with the ESP stability control, aid systems for braking in cases of emergency need need to be equipped with a light equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already responsible for all new authorised passenger cars and light small carriers, for the remaining vehicles a driving deadline was set by the end of February 2011.
The European Union's adoption aims to improve the protection of foot-and-mouth disease, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many instances of outbreaks due to their working methods.
The task of the brake assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical brake handle, which recognises the system using the brake strengths performed by the driver on the brake pedal.
However, this system does not pass this pressure until the end.
According to a study commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers developed in an accident were no longer able to ride on the brake pedal and half of them had not been fired with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the other hand, the brakes help achieve maximum power in the brake system and thereby reduce the brake time and therefore also the brake resistance that causes a car to return to the brake process.
According to one EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents caused by foot-and-mouth disease could be prevented if all cars with this type of emergency assistance were equipped.
There would be even fewer accidents - it is estimated that every fourth accident could be prevented by personal damage - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects (over radar or a camera) obstacles and alerts the driver, at the same time having a light pressure on the brakes.
If the driver reacts to this, the system will help him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the combination is already inevitable, the brake assistant will use the maximum pressure on the brakes to keep the damage as low as possible in this way.
General engines move the plan for Opel until January
While the crew of the Opel Work in Figueruela (Zaragoza) has already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will be started in the first week of April, probably on 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer indicates that he needs more time to complete the Opel Rescue Plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants to realize that the parties concerned are already in line with each point of the plan.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which the work is carried out, will be delivered by the beginning of 2010.
However, the GM will ensure that a decision will be taken on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on American car farmers to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM has to be in contact with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who also wants to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of skiper sports cars, which has been recognised by the Russian Converg group, has been increasingly demanding.
If any of these buyers should come to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to strike Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to be maintained.
At the tax of Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their newest and very expensive jewellery, engineers used the box S as the basis and actually made it easier for him to make 80 kilos, with only 1.275 kilos now.
In order to create something like this, they stopped at the automatic floating roof, which was replaced by a cell shift with manual drive, so that only 21 kilos were separated; thanks to the aluminium tubes used in this model, such as the GT3 "remove" 15 more; by the removal of the air system, the fuel tank was reduced from 64 to 54 litres and 7 kilos were added; by the installation of sports backquet seats 12 times and by the light 19-inch flags again.
Then there was even less than six kilos of the CDR-30 audio system and the missing kilo was achieved through the exchange of the cities by tapping from the substance.
Although it is also available with the double-coupling engine PDK, the test was carried out with a vehicle with 6-way handrails, mainly on the smaller country track of California, on mountains that were really very curved.
In his driving behaviour, he can only be given the notes without a taddle.
The reduction of his weight, however, would not have led him to be so sure that he would no longer be on the strike.
It is the opposite of the case: for a long time we have no longer tried such a small and easy model, which at the same time also gives a sense of great security at the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small atthelet, able to warm his muscles at a low pace in the time required, until we give him the orders to grow, to fry, to catch himself and then to get everything out of his engine again ...
He's doing everything he's told. The car does everything we can with our hands on the rail, thanks to his link, which is both communicative and precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 PS (10 more than the boxer S) has been reached and you can still raise it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change engine noise, which has already been used for the first time by Panama.
The acceleration capacity is unforeseeable, whether out of the stage or in the new acceleration.
The federations are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country straves that we heard with the boxer Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the battleships well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole route; and this, although we found some of these Eis curves in the morning and the morning.
In summary, you can say that it's an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an unprescribed ride pass, as if it were rather rare and much more than a small improvement of the boxster Ss.
The car will be marketed in February 2010 and will cost EUR 70.831.
Bag Girl
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the Coco Cocoon Cocoon cosmetic line and an opportunity starled at the fashion scenes of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck strength as her pockets of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she's a "Bag Girl".
The Basconia Gives itself a Victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated a magnificent triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complicated football field of Maccabi Electro, and thus came to the first place within his group after Mirza Teletovic, who was eight times the best of his team (29 at the evaluation).
The men of Vitoria were able to replace the significant losses of Herrmann, Olison, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of use and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end of their victory.
The great hits out of the perimeter with 16 rated triangles are probably contributing to their final victory.
The game started with the lead of the flowers that were placed at the top of the display table from the beginning.
Since the first four bodies of the man from Vitoria had already come out of the perimeter, they could already have learned that they had come to the game field with warm hands.
It was English and Teletovic who were primarily responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the man from Álva decided to play a game inside Barac and for the game of Eliahu, who was received when he returned to the man with pfiffen and applaus, which is his home to build up his advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already begun to highlight himself as the best man with 13 points, even though the "minimum six" evaluation of Splitter has already enjoyed that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilians.
Nevertheless, the game was not yet decided despite the great advantage in the break, and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians once again that not everyone won their game field, and thanks to the ever-increasing "hand of Elijah" they returned to the game.
Edson and Pnini strongly support the conversion of the "Gelbens" to the Ruder (50-49).

The team of Ivanovic, injured, but all other than dead, had to prepare a few toys with trouble safety to get back to the air and suddenly came to Mirza Teletovic's gun, which provided almost three follow-up tricks and the support of English and Ribas, to ensure that the display table again shows an impressive distance of (54-67) which the guests could enjoy at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
In the last quarter, the Alevesen were bloated and English and San Emeterio (60-75) had already announced that they would not allow anyone to take back the victory they had truly deserved in the first three minutes.
On the other hand, Pinni and Eidson, who do not best their men and try to give their men back three points from the line (70-77).
Despite the fact that the team of Ivanovic did not stand up, and even though split up because of fouls, the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time in this season (80-85).
Persecution prevented Unicaja from being ordered the stars
Unicaja lost his voice in Greece against Olympics and had to take the lead in Group B of the Eurolagia, which in a game that was marked by the events from the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the internal game, which made Greece easier to win.
The man from Málaga was neither afraid of the vote in the Hall of Peace nor of the friendship nor of the opposite man who may be one of the strongest Europeans, and had a lot of money.
The Andalusiers had to sleep in their first quarter thanks to their gifted game. A aggressive defense and three consecutive trifles, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, mixed the guests with 12-18 in the 9 minutes.
Olympicos was surprised by the intensity of the unicaja ere, even though the local man with a game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis created that the display table in the 13 minutes 22-20 shows its best, the minutes in which it would be almost due to an action between the two Americans and Beverley and Williams, and they were both disqualified on the way.
The Greek team finally started to get hot and its addiction to both toys, while the separation of the Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three errors caused by Carlos Jiménez were due to major traces at Unicaja.
Among their players in the inner field and the Lithuanian leader Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19 minutes at 44-32.
An attack was impossible.
The third quarter was marked by many attacks against the crew of Olympicos, who survived his 19 losses and even managed to compare the difference between the game in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27 minutes, which led to the movement within the group.
Unicaja tried to move around the many disasters and the disappearance of Robert Archibald's wounded shooter during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja in the 31st minute thanks to the federation and the trifles of Cook and the use of Lewis, there was hope again at 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was not really possible that the Olympics, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimetres within the corrugated area, were not too slow.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic created it in 37 minutes to raise the corb difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to strike and had to take the lead in Olympicos.

Brazil calls Zelaya a date to be left
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in her mission in Tegucigalpa.
The President appointed by the Office must leave the diplomatic representation no later than 27 January 2010 when his term of office expires officially.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian message in the Honduran capital, confirmed TV Global, that "Mel" webbed that he had to leave the message he had found since September 21st.
"He is convinced that he has to go on January 27th, because his mandate is running this day and he has to find a new accommodation."
The messenger also invited the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the deadline set, "My position is, as soon as possible, to go, logically with the return of the Government of Brazil," Zelaya on the phone said.
After the elections on 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo was held as a winner), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian message until January.
However, he tried to get access to Brazil this week.
However, this did not mean that Zelayas refused to acknowledge the status of an asylum seeker who wanted to force the "de facto" government under the chairmanship of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the most exciting days of the past spring, when the inflation of the assets was the previous vote on the markets, the uncertainty was restored on the markets, which is hardly surprising, as this is its natural state, in a environment where the Creator makes decisions about a future of nature that is uncertain.
The argument used to stabilise the markets was to compare the debt with the direct purchase of assets and to allow the liquidity to be indirectly free of interest that moves around the zero to buy the assets in this way.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are as well finished as they are and that without their heterodox liquidity policy, start to throw some sand into the pipeline, as the ECB has already done with its annual expansion, which takes place next week.
Therefore, the investors are uncertain about the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox seizures, and we will just witness a change in the reduction of risk premiums.
The flows of the bears and the differences between the companies are increasing, even though they are still far away from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The Member States were forced to recognize the private risks and the State debt increased again.
It is now based on quality and the United States, Japan and Germany are the preferred destination of investors, which is also leading to an increase in the differences between the euro area countries in Germany.
Spain has so far been affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's came and had a new review of Spain's assessment.
On the other hand, there is no doubt that the advocates of moral risks who have tried again to raise awareness of what they had caused, since they had broken down the devastating effects of the restrictions on the loss of jobs if they had actually decided a new day of gratitude.
However, what is happening in Dubai indicates a tribal war between the emiries in order to restore power in the emirates and development in Greece has already been foreseen.
A government that shifts State debt, elections and a new government that is on the same side.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal to Duráo Barroso.
It does not make sense that Ecofin Hungary saves from non-compliance with its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and therefore joins a Euro Member State to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the contrary, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens with the necessity of excessive deficits in order to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, we are looking forward to an episode of normalization of the risk premiums, after some transfers to high amounts, which would now be within the expectations.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in State debt are increased at the same speed as the European companies.
However, if European differences were to be reduced and Spain would continue to increase, this would be a special Spanish risk.
The standard & Poor's is a step. While the above-mentioned indicators require a large part of the market research institutes to propose their scenarios for recovery and to correct their scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, which will come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all the warnings do not guarantee long life.
It is quite likely that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "Poverty on the Road" has been said.

The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, is discussing the strategy for the energy supply of Spain in the next two decades as early as the sub-committee of Parliament.
Following his appearance, following the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few points about what he had submitted to the Sub-Committee behind closed doors.
According to the President of Iberdrola, Spain will have to invest EUR 50 billion by 2020 and another 60 billion from that date until 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the necessary investments would run not to 60 billion, but to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola is of the opinion that it is no longer necessary to invest in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international connections.
Since 2020 the question will be changed and the performance should be increased.
Its proposal focuses both on gas and coal plants with installations to capture carbon dioxide and, of course, on renewable energy.
In this case, it follows that 18,000 MW will be needed more, provided that it is provided for by other "supporting energy".
Galán, who is of the opinion that the draft legislation for a sustainable economy which was just adopted by the government, on a line with what his company has requested, did not want to say in any case anything against this law how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policies in the fight against climate change.
His opinion is that "one has been clearly on this direction for a long time, despite some" individual taboos, as the president of Iberdrola called it.
As it is, Galán believes that decisions on investment should be made now, even if they are long-term, because it will take some time and a stable compensation framework will need to be created to attack them.
Ferrovial gets the "Handling" from Aer Lingus on ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, Swiss Swiss sport, is the preferred partner of the Irish airlines Aer Lingus for the package service at ten European airports to which they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The Agreement, which has not yet been notified, shall be concluded for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castile-La Mancha and Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a protocol for cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The Union plans investments of 20 million to 2012, of which 50 % of railways will be generated.

Akiona competes with high station and Bouygues for its first car construction in Australia
Akiona is fighting for the approval of its first highway in Australia, a market in which she has already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction to which it is used is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about EUR 1,047 billion).
The French company Bouygues and the German high school are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Actiona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and car operator.
The city administration wants to have completed the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration of public-private cooperation (PPP is the English derogation) had decided to proceed with the project following a business plan set up by Ernst & Young, the management is already in possession of a complete list of candidates for construction and construction management.
In the wake of the tenders presented in May, the estimated investments amounted to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), with three concerts, mainly from European construction companies, competed together in the last phase.
The group called Transcity is directed by Akiona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghela.
The first company is one of Australia's major construction companies, while the second with seat in Italy is one of the best specialists for deep construction.
The Consortium Northern Direct, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for infrastructures and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last Consortium, which is in the lower election, is called LBRJV, composed of the capital of the Australian Leighton (the subsidiary of the German construction company, which belongs to ACS), the domestic Baulderstone (in possession of the German Bilfinger Berger group) and the French company Razel, which has specialized on the public building.
However, the Australian market for infrastructure promises strong construction and privatizations, which is worth overcoming because it is only through the purchase of a domestic construction company.
A strategy that has been followed by the so-called high-tech or Bilinger companies, in addition to Asian references, and which must only be followed by Spanish builders.
Even ACS has only obtained access to this market through its participation of 30 % to height, owner of the so-called Lighton, access.
Millions of Active
Akiona places on this geographical area the highest importance for the industry, in which it is already well known because of its activity as energy provider and in the desalination industry.
In addition, it already has its huge windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies that have been commissioned to build and manage Adelaide's settlement facility with a budget of 700 million.
Its purpose is now to consolidate itself in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to both construction and infrastructure.
The underground mautstrek supported by the city's city infrastructure office and the Northern Link (Northern importer) has the purpose of connecting the western road to the road in Toowong with the environmental traffic in Kelvin Grove (see map) to a length of 5 km through tunnels. This is about the grave mavnam to be pushed down on the streets of Brisbane.
The road plan issued by the city administration is the year ahead of the 2010 delivery and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this road is to be opened for transport in the last months of 2014, it is clear that construction work will be continued until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
He has two tracks in each direction, an electronic wall system and a complex exhaust system.
The Government of Queensland is participating in funding with 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million).
For heights, Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia grants high-ranking contracts to the government with a total of 154 million contracts yesterday.
The ACS Joint Undertaking will improve the infrastructure of the Inland broadband network by using its domestic subsidiary Lighton.
This improvement will create fast Internet access for 400,000 people and the German company will work for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the King George Tower construction project with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction work has not started yet and has received 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke about the construction and administration of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investments amount to EUR 75 million.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has acquired its subsidiary Alpine, which has built a tunnel over 2.1 km long for a bus in Slovenia over the sum of EUR 64.5 million.
The company received this contract only a few days after it received the aid for the construction of the tunnel of Bosruck (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way Alpine enhances its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of construction is planned for early 2010 and its implementation will take more than 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore gets advertising from Renfe
Renfe has written advertising and marketing services for the next two years by Sra. Rushmore on a sum of about three million euros a year, the railway company shared with.
This agreement also provides for two extensions of each 12 months. Ms. Rushmore was elected among 16 agencies representing this competition of raced race, of which 4 came to the end, among them TBWA, which was responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore is responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
More than 63 million for France Télécom because of the distortion of competition.
France Télécom, the regulatory authority for competition in France, has imposed a fine of over EUR 63 million on anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has limited competition in the case of fixed networks and telephones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and trust programmes for consumers at the regulatory level.
Together with this sanctions, the former French monopol and still state-owned companies have collected more than EUR 560 million in the form of a ban on their competitors since 1994.
The punishment imposed yesterday was even increased, as the authority waiting for the competition is of the opinion that France Télécom has committed similar damage in the past and has therefore been renegotiated.
Application trade
On the other hand, the French company’s subsidiary has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application website for increased revenue from non-telephone companies on the Internet.
In principle, this application website of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
It is necessary to wait until 2010 for this site to be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has been introduced by Madrid and Barça since the beginning of 476.4 million.
The League's champions have developed since its birth in 1992 as an input source for the football club.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476.4 million, bringing them the third and fifth places of football clubs that have earned most of the money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The UEFA League champions to win not only brings peace with themselves. It is also one of the main sources of the great unity.
According to UEFA, up to €5.362.5 million was distributed to the 105 people (of which 12 Spanish) participating in this event since its establishment in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The Women's Club is located in third place in Europe, which has earned most of the money by its participation, and the only one who has won the trophies three times in addition to the AC Mailland.
The official Catalan Master and final winner of the former European Cup 1992 represents the fifth place.
The list leads to Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two men, who also took part in most of the money by participating in the previous Champoins League.
And that, even though they lost them against Barza.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place of the countries that were able to take money from the champions, although it has more titles than all others (five, in contrast to four in Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This apparent objection is expressed by the complicated monetary distribution procedure used by UEFA.
In this business year, the organization, whose chairman Michel Platini has entered, is estimated to be 1,090 million by the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the qualification round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who fought for participation received 3.8 million by their bloke presence, in addition to the EUR 550,000 for each game they fight.
There is also another bonus for winning (€800,000) and for a difference (400,000 per man). The clubs that have come to the end receive three million each; the four who have come to the quarter finals receive 3.3 million.
The last four received 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, in contrast to the second, which receives 5.2 million.
A football club thus achieves at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million fixed revenue.
Barça won again with his victory at the European Supercup in August 2.5 million.
However, there are still variable payments for the 337.8 million.
This money is distributed proportionally to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is the first and has 4 assigned places.
In the last year, the master receives 40% of the money allocated, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part will be distributed according to the number of games they play in this year's issue.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29,9% participation in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group has been able to provide details on the purchase offer of shares with which it wants to acquire a ceiling between 25 and 29.9% of Sos's capital.
A percentage which is not forced by the number of shares to make a public statement (opa).
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per share paid for 10 years and with a interest rate of 1 % per year due to this disbursement.
Yesterday the Sos shares were closed with EUR 1.85, so Nueva Rumasa assessed the company under market value 18%.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of EUR 1,50 reflects the real assessment of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The group from Jerez gives shareholders a 15-day period to share their interest in the sale of their shares.
CMMV assured that it was not informed of this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateus confirmed that it had been contacted with the Authority.
At one end, the payment would be made to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos further structured his business management.
When trying to stay at the edge of possible purchases and the legal frameworks of his former manager, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal book review.
A decision to make for the first woman who has a high position in the food business.
It is a newly created post that is directly supported by the chairperson of the group.
This is all other than freedom from Polishism, because the company has been developed in a legal battle because of the suspicion of joining more than 230 million Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos will move another capital over the next month.
In view of the Salazar loan yesterday, the ex-brothers Ildefonso Ortega and Angela Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) came to the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the distribution of 212 million without their determination.
CMMV approves the public statement submitted by the investment company Mer by Paterina
On 9 October, the National Committee of the Regions (CNMV) approved the public statement submitted by the Investment Company Mer for Federico Paterina.
The Supervisory Authority stated that it approved this claim after it had been proved that the conditions of the law are respected and therefore the content of the proposed statement, as amended by the last 2 December, can be considered "extended".
CMMV has also announced that this offer for purchase of 550,008 shares of Federico Paterina at the price of 7,65 euros per share, which is again 8.95 % of the company's capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 euro in the stock exchanges of Madrid and Bilbao.
Moreover, it was also reported that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed which cannot be transferred until the end of the tender and their price has been determined in accordance with the laws of the law.
New vehicle monitoring programmes
In these days of weather and accidents, only KFZ plants do not deserve
Every day thousands of vehicles developed in an accident will be placed in the workshops where a customer needs to assess the damages and costs of repair.
No single accident is equal and the calculation of costs for parts and hours of work can be a long-term and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including parts and hours of work, may take up to two or three hours.
On the contrary, with the support of the latest IT tools, a question of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of customers use these types of systems.
The service and application providers shall collect the information they receive from manufacturers to process them and provide their customers with a useful program.
In Spain, Audadex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all opinions are created with their products.
The two other companies competing with the tool market for monitoring and drafting a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturer is all but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, sales leader of Audadex, 63 manufacturers and importers are cooperating with each other, providing the information in another format.
Moreover, the amount of data to be processed will continue to worsen until the point is that more versions, variants and motorizations have come on the market in the last five years than in the entire fifteen years.
As soon as a new car arrives on the market, the business begins to work.
It is an important task because each of the thousands of vehicle parts must be catalysed and their price must be entered.
In addition, each model will create a "intelligent" graphics image on which different parts of the vehicle can "click" on.
If there is a lot of sales model, the work can be completed within a week if the procedure is early.
If this is a less necessary car, it can take up to three or four months. At present, Audadex has 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain for full information.
Among the exclusive models, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In view of the vehicle park running on the tracks, it is over 99 %.
For the purposes of the implementation of documentation and the production of databases, Audadex has eight centres worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and has specialized each of them on certain markets.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There are more than a hundred technicians working simultaneously with three monitors.
Audadex invests EUR 90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Each month they collect 2.5 million data and their customers get updates every second day.
The development of this huge flow of information allows companies to use them in various ways and thereby offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and equipment, but there are tools to manage broken parts or to calculate the error or remainder of a car.
The only company that is about a leader who informs about the value of the car in Spain is Eurotax.
Audadex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
In the review of the products offered by audatex, you can easily get a overview of the type of support they provide to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, where the Star of the AudaPlus products is a standard solution to detect accidents for the customers.
It includes vehicles, motor vehicles, as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the costs for the parts, it includes the repair periods or the lacquering prices estimated by the manufacturer.
This tool is paid for every purpose, i.e. for every opinion.
The most expensive is for customers who rarely use it at least 10 times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the contrary, any insurance company that manufactures thousands of goods deals the price with audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it was operated by the assembly band.
AudaGlass works with the vehicle ships, and AudaSubastas is a service for the open service market on the Internet that can be offered for vehicles that have been declared to be completely damaged.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, in conducting geodemographic analyses or in order to obtain information about the differences by brand and model.
For example, you can examine how many models of a particular car were needed because of panic in the workshop or how many of them were developed in a certain period of time in a serious accident.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company that is dedicated to the development of this type of computers.
It is distributed among other Gt estimates, which is also intended for customers and provides the same type of digital images, access to shares or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Ensa Group, which was established in 1971 as a provider for services and solutions for the assessment of damages, panic or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT leader for ideas is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3.100 customers and 53 insurance companies.
In the last three years, its business volume has increased by 20% per year and consumption of €10.8 million in 2008.
In the beginning of last year, they began to go to the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
In contrast, Audadex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the sources of the company, 62% of its business is carried out in Europe and the rest of the world, and 38% remain in North and South America. They work together with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 jobs, 3,000 of which are in Spain.

Since 2007, they have been at the New York Stock Exchange and part of the Reference Index Standard & Poor's.
Enlargement of accidents on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline Group purchased a platform online for the sale of accident vehicles and motor vehicles.
This purchase meant the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could rise to the rest of the 15% in the next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to provide its customers with more services and added value, with the possibility of accessing a wide international market.
This review and purchase service is exclusively addressed to industry professionals, such as insurance companies, customers, car rental companies, workshops, cutting places and car dealers who are required to register before their activities.
This platform was established in Germany in 1996 and managed more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of which alone in Germany.
Their main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today the website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 customers.
Every day 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added every day to the Spanish market.
According to the Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose vehicle number has been registered must no longer be subjected to the persecution, but must be used as replacement parts of certain undamaged parts.
On the other hand, cars with historical value may be allowed again even if they have been registered after difficult authorities.
Cost proposal of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that in only four steps the user receives a cost proposal: identification of the vehicle, search for the replacement, creation and creation of a cost proposal.
The easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially in order to convince older people that they are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 land vehicles, 137 motor vehicles, 78 small carriers and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with Internet connection to use.
After the repair model has been identified using the vehicle design number, a graph of the respective model appears and then the needed replacement will be selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for working hours, prices or discounts and can then print the cost proposal and pass it on to his customers.
AudaTaller, however, is not a tool for viewing AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that it does not include any estimated working hours allocated to the workshop.
The cost of use for this tool shall be EUR 350 per year, an amount which the customer may pay without further payment.
The company is currently working to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that is waiting for the auto mechanic for a long time, since you can choose a door with it for example and then turn the image completely to look at the inside.
