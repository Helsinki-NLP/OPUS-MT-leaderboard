The Borsa di Prague at the end of the market had a negative turn.
After the storm of the morning, the Borsa of Prague restored the losses.
The transaction of the CEZ shares has reached almost half of the current trade.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Borsa di Prague has recovered from the roof of the day before it was almost 6%.
Back to this rebellion there's the crowd of actions at Wall Street.
So, too, we have a market reaction to the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which has refused to support the local financial sector's stabilization plan.
Action trolley in Asia
Tuesday the Asian Borse actions have lived a dramatic turn, despite the indexes, however, during the day they have subsequently cancelled part of the losses.
Hong Kong's Hong Kong Board's Hang Seng index during the day has cancelled almost 4%, but then a part of the losses is set at 2.5%.
The Hong Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the move of Chinese actions to the Hong Kong Border, has decreased by 3.8% while in Shanghai the markets have been closed.
The actions at Sydney's Borsa lost more than 5%, but in the end the losses were reduced to 4.3%.
Thay-Wan's Borsa, according to the local index, was down by 3.6%.
"The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and this will affect financial markets all over the world," observed the head of Hong Kong's Currency Office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages only financial policy, so without relying on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has rates of interest at the same level as the United States.
American legislators, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should return to the dialogue quickly and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, there is the risk that other countries also have consequences.
America action strategy
The US Parliament rejected the support plan for the financial system, for which 700 billion dollars had to be allocated (about twelve billion Czech crowns).
The legislators have thus ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help to stabilize the whole economy.
American actions on Monday have lived a strike, and the main indicators of the actions have recorded the biggest round of more than one fan.
The Dow Jones index has been reduced by almost 7% and a similar proportion has been observed for the last time in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but as soon as it became clear that the design of the law was not approved, it was free to fall.
Congress has passed: the U.S. government can expand $700 billion to banks.
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote will take place at the beginning of the next week.
The US legislators have broken the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of economic assistance for the US financial system for a total of $700 million (about twelve billion of crowns).
But it's not ready yet.
The representatives of the Congress must, therefore, define some details of the matter before the final form of the law is published and voting.
The support plan for the financial system will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the Chamber of Representatives.
So said Domenica to Reuters, Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the Barney Frank Room.
According to some sources, the Senate could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the economies, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and most fundamental psychological factor to be able to re-establish the financial markets.
However, there will be a return to reality due to the complexity of the mechanisms with which, in practice, the aid of the markets will be achieved.
Paulson: the Plan must be effective
"We have taken a big step forward."
"We have clarified our different views on the way the package is presented for market stability," said democratic Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg agency.
According to the same , the final vote could still take place Sunday.
Members of the legislators met on the evening between Saturday and Sunday with the Minister of American Finance Henry Paulson to finalize the government's financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire non-debt mortgages from financial companies, which bring financial companies to serious losses and endanger the stability of the whole system.
"We are committed to the final agreement of the plan which will work and which must also be effective on the market."
"It's necessary to bring the recovery plan forward, but I think we're here," said Paulson.
The Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis is very much on the markets of the actions that are fraught with it.
According to Nevada Harry Reid's democratic senator, the legislators are trying to reach a final agreement at the Congress even before Sunday.
They want to calm down investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are, in turn, the first to influence the market in Monday following the Congress decision.
But for now it is definitely not clear when the two Chambers of the American Congress will vote in law and even if negotiations can be stopped at the last moment on some issues.
The legislators hope to be approved in the coming days.
But the law will still make a lot of changes.
The total amount provided for in support of the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush asked.
But Congress can block the rest of the sum in case it will have the impression that the program does not perform its function, blocking the next 100 billion dollars and after the end 350.
Bush appreciated the progress in the negotiations.
Although the President may vote on this decision the Congress may, but he may lose his right to vote.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the programme remained, i.e. to obtain funding to buy passive mortgages, whose price is broken by hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We've done everything.
The Chamber of Representatives should be able to vote on the law of Sunday and the Senate of Monday," said the Senator of the Republic.
Progress in negotiations is also met by US President Bush.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush is satisfied with the positive trend of Saturday and appreciates "the effort of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of gold parachutes
The President of the Banking Committee of the Senate, Mr Dodd, said that the legislators were committed to the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of the reduction budget, the fractionation of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit so-called gold parachutes for the managers of companies participating in the programme and is creating a committee that will monitor the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and have taken a great step forward to the agreement that will work and be useful for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan relates to the aid to owners of houses who have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate new mortgage rates, which will cover the objective of lowering monthly rates for creditors and allowing them to have their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the main economy of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's why we don't know how and what price will buy the problem assets
This will determine how the financial sector and the government will divide the losses between them," Marek said this week for the iHNed.cz website.
If the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of the next week it is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
"More importantly, this week the representatives of the convention have already reached an agreement on the support of this plan and are being baptized as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is now more important," Marek stressed.
The latest blood dueel: MP3 against cell readers
We will advise you how to choose
While almost every cell phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
From this it is clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Despite this, there are many reasons for seeking an autonomous reader.
The choice depends on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
You may find it difficult to buy a high-quality high-quality guitar to listen to the latest album by Maxim Turbulenc.
First of all, these musical products do not appear as LP and from a qualitative point of view for this there is no objective reason.
But if on your chafals you will be covered with hard-rock, jazz or blues probably, a kind of giraffe like the least you dream about.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
There are also categories of prices and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend for a reader of 8 thousand crowns, as well as a fan of the Pink Floyds may hardly digest the coffees from twenty crowns in the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The decision is the duration of the batteries.
Some high-quality musical readers are able to do much more than simply read music, but they don't even make the cell phones wrong.
There is no other current device as universal as mobile.
In addition to primary functions, telephone and texting, you can read music and video, record both and have a camera, sometimes better and maybe you can also navigate.
And if we take into account the smartphones and the palmaris will also have a computer in charge.
It's a little miracle because no refrigerator can make the grid and no TV can photograph anything.
The universality of the cell phone also brings benefits.
More functions you use on your cell phone and first the monitor indicator will require the battery.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
A few cell phones are able to read music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, musical readers (mostly the simplest) are much more effective.
As far as economic cells are concerned, they may last for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from time to time, when, some call, you're looking for work to secure another battery, that's also true for the most expensive devices.
But you will not have this problem with a MP3 reader, even the worst will last at least 9 hours with continuous load.
Another problem arises when you download music in your cell phone.
Unfortunately only a limited part of devices have a universal USB port and not all can connect to your computer without a special software.
Of course the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory readers are able to make it without adaptor for minicards that are not used on the cell phones.
Readers, except for some exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Just fill in the device with music via USB from the computer.
Most readers create only a multimedia library ordered by the names of the interpreters, album name, genre or by the user's classification.
Some devices only reproduce the folder tree structure, like the Explorer tool in Windows, and some can do both things (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manage, cell phones can do more.
When choosing a particular device, you are especially interested in the resistance of battery, memory capacity, quality and type of audio output and clearly the ease of use.
If music serves you mainly from the background and if you listen to it all the days just briefly on the tram you have enough to make any MP3 read.
That's right now, of course, any cell phone.
You do not have to care too much about how your cell phone or reader recognises you.
The MP3 readers all support them, the global majority of the music that comes to you will be exactly in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most common ones, the majority of devices support music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (form used by Apple and its iPods).
The best cell phones also allow, for example, to buy online music.
Just visit, via the mobile Internet, the operator's corresponding pages (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid argument to buy a reader cell.
Unfortunately, the operator's offer is poor and is limited, usually only to hits at the time of the radio.
Prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this mode of sale of music (both through GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always get their cell phone behind.
Anyone wants to listen to any cheese in the bag while the MP3 player is forgotten at home.
But it also depends on this, if you always carry the cafiettes or at least the earring without a wire.
If not, you can use the integrated player that almost every cell, but only a small part of MP3 readers, has.
Perhaps the greatest advantage of readers will be, for many, the price.
The most economics usually cost less than 3 thousand crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of income for the coffee communities.
The best and most equipped technically equipped cell phones and also the 3.5 mm handle for common coffees, cost up to 15 milligrams of crown.
Rather, the advantage of readers is, in addition to others, easy management.
The simpler ones do not necessarily need more economics (see our choice) that makes it really easy for anyone to manage them.
The least of the functions, the similarity of the manoeuvre at a time with the stereo community or perhaps the circuits, is obvious.
There is no danger of misbehaving the start of the mobile Internet network and of the consequence of a huge package for data transmission.
Which device to take
Even the most economic mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (from type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with regard to the purchase of the respective card, it is recorded in the 2,000 crowns.
But be careful.
Base models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones do it with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a cell phone and you want to buy a low cost MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to capacity (max. 2 GB) you must not spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are part of the most demanding audiences, you prefer to take specialized mobiles - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual MP3 keys and the service comfort is so close to the same MP3 player.
In this area, Sony Ericsson has made more streets, whose walkman-line phones have the same use scale as MP3 readers sold separately.
The MP3 readers of the above brands ensure the same service and price category up to 4,000 crowns, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (commonly 15 hours, at maximum to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic already this year.
Maybe
Perhaps the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer virtually all the services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, something is missing – a virtual operator that requires traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe he won't be missing for a long time.
The fact that these operators belong to the most expensive ones in Europe has already been written many times on Mobile.cz.
At the end of the accounts it also confirmed ČTÜ, which made it clear that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the area of the regulation of roaming tariffs, there may be a paradoxal situation - for some mobile operators whose SMSs will cost less than outdoors than at home.
How can prices in the Czech Republic remain so high in Europe?
The answer is simple, lacking competition that would really want to start the dispute.
It may sound absurd, even though we have three mobile networks and coverage high above 100%.
Instead of mobile phone operators, they like to laugh at the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTÜ), Pavel Dvorák, has also often stressed that in the past there was no other operator in the Czech Republic.
It is true that the traditional operator with its network is no longer likely to have many possibilities. (The rest may be difficult to find other frequencies now.)
But there is yet another possibility - the virtual operator.
The entry into the market of virtual operators itself has led to a significant reduction in prices, which the traditional operators should then have responded to.
At the same time, even before the entry of squalls such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile in the market, similar voices were collected in Great Britain like us.
However, it has been shown that the place for operators of the species is there and that they can have really succeeded.
At the end of the accounts for examples, we don't have to go very far.
In February of this year, we informed you about the arrival of the virtual mobileking operator in Poland.
In only half a year this operator has been able to conquer more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group in which the Czech Republic belongs between the other U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete press group.
In order to actually operate it, many less customers than a traditional operator.
They do not go back, that is, relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators are often low-cost, offer low-cost calls and SMS, which is often in balance with the offer of the strictest services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS that costs at least half of its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good mossy too on a non-smoker group.
This operator therefore specifically refers to men.
"The real men choose mobileking operators who like and who can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company who produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we can say a concept similar to that in Poland.
There is no doubt in the press spokesman for Vodafone Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which the majority of virtual operators are based.
More than the point of view of services is relatively satisfactorily."
In Czech Republic no possibility, mobile network operators say
But it seems almost certain that if there's ever been an operator in the Czech Republic, it won't be Mobilking.
"It is about the expansion of this success project, but in the Czech Republic negotiations do not have a lot of expectations.
Mobilking's arrival will take place in the other countries of our area," said Jana Studničkova, the printer of the Penta Financial Group in a telephone dialogue for Mobile.cz Jana Studničková.
He has thus indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are certainly not very favourable to this view.
Instead, they try to do everything because there is no competitive potential.
For a while he did not hide his interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Nova group that wanted to do so would take another step to become a real competitor of Telephonika O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
It's better first.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all the blind operators of the mobile network.
We have already been able to move forward in negotiations with some of them," says Paul Kaidl's spokesman.
So maybe better times will come.
The non-official information suggests that the first virtual operator should have it at the end of the year.
For now, however, around its creation there is an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At this moment we do not believe that in the Czech market there is room for the creation of a full-time virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no subject with a complex and serious project has come to our attention," he mentioned in his statement to Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršönn of the print section of Telephone O2.
The Czech market's specificity also includes other operators.
T-Mobil printer Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with the O2: "We have not yet noted any vital and beneficial commercial project for both, on which it is possible to continue to build".
And it adds: "In the T-Mobile network, a virtual operator will be difficult to find within the end of the year.
At this point, we must already have a concrete agreement on the table, so that it could be considered as a horizontal one."
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on meeting its requirements of the 3G licence.
Add Miroslav Čepický : "We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators, especially in terms of the sharing of costs and infrastructure.
We consider this to be the most productive aspect of the customer's view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet."
The competent authorities - with the full operators
The attitude of mobile phone operators can easily be understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thus lower profit.
Then why facilitate the access of such a competitor?
The drawings around the creation of U:fon testify that when operators have something they can do from the same part.
Perhaps the great pressure was exerted against ČTÜ in the period of U:fon’s creation towards T-Mobile company.
This shows public access information from the ČTÜ websites.
But now own U:fon serves as an argument that does not accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová observed: "The competitive environment of the mobile phone market was little more powerful than the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the typology of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the income of another competitor would be on him and above all on his high-pressure services."
However, the attitude of mobile phone operators is quite surprising to the full interest of the Czech regulatory bodies.
It is not just the attitude of the ČTÜ which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic - unlike Great Britain and other developed countries - does not have the power to intervene in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Economic Competition Protection Office (UOHS).
However, in the face of all the problems, this has taken its typical position.
"The entry of the virtual operator on the mobile phone market would be possible after the completion of the contract for the rental of the infrastructure required between mobile operator and virtual operator.
No kind of contract has been concluded until now because the offer of potential buyers is probably not interesting enough for traditional operators," said Kristián Chalupa , of the UOHS External Relations Section in our questionnaire.
Such a statement made by the representatives of the operators may not be surprising.
Instead of the office that must defend the interests of consumers and above all take into account the fact that no one benefits from its position on the market, it is more than a delicate matter.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Where virtual operators work generally, we can note that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile phone services."
But of course the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and price reduction do not fall within the interests of UOHS.
It's really shocking in the whole situation, it's almost the emotional harmony of these three operators as a result of their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is one, it is one.
As well as the identical price of gasoline for all petrol is the fruit of coincidence and competition.
"The section has not found anti-competitive behaviour signs on this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so it does not have a corresponding greater responsibility for its market behaviour.
The necessary tools for opening up the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be missing to the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa mentioned in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points .
There is, of course, the analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÜ, according to which telecommunications is from the point of view of economic competition the single market.
On a market of the kind, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator, the network operator's agreement is always necessary.
And the mobile operator has at the end of the accounts logically – the monopoly of his network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant by force.
But even if we do not accept this argument, for UOHS it should be a minimum warning that three mobile operators are doing so strangely similar.
At the same time, complaints from stakeholders (including the said company GTS Novara) show that during negotiations with all operators, there are very similar obstacles.
Downloading ČTÜ's responsibility in telecommunications is a very frequent trick with which ÚOHS is out of all the facts.
We've already seen this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to promote the expansion of ČTú's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recently approved telecommunications law was updated, despite the fact that many experts were looking forward to improving the situation.
The representatives of UOHS must know more than well, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere.
You can do it when no one's watching
While we do not agree with the operation of these pseudo-virtual operators, there are some of them in the Czech mobile networks.
It is companies that publish their lists of prices of mobile phone services but are only partially published.
This is usually the case with companies dealing with multi-level marketing.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the eligible persons.
Magic is the fact that the company faces the operator as a classic company customer, who orders a large amount of SIM card.
As an important customer then receives special offers of prices (and so on).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile phone operators prevent a similar sale.
"If the cases you have discussed, which we are interested in, could be dealt with in breach of the contractual terms, and could arise in the conclusion of cooperation with that company," answered the question regarding Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that a kind of activity would not come to the ears of the responsible subjects of mobile phone operators.
In the case of the 3 companies mentioned above, thousands of customers can be treated.
No operator defends himself at the same time from a kind of attitude.
From the activities of these companies, they draw a non-inferior benefit and at the same time - unlike the actual virtual operators - they are not damaged in any way by their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, however only one percentage of customers uses the services of these companies.
These also have to accept that SIM card on their phone is not registered on their behalf, so they can not be fully available as regular customers of mobile phone operators "
But this should result in a minimal shock to the ČTú.
In addition, another question is raised for UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to a kind of attitude, why are they blocking the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has strong enough rights to mask similar activities and if it does not, it will not have to be satisfied with the explanation of operators who have no idea of all of this and that their commercial conditions prevent it.
When we're not going to be expensive anymore
As already mentioned in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile phone market has led to a significant reduction in service prices.
At the same time practically in all countries where operators were born, traditional operators tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were practically identical - market too small, to too much content, problems with quality services, etc.
However, in the developed countries in these cases, regulatory authorities have intervened, not from mobile telephone operators, but from their customers.
Both with formal measures and with non-formal pressure, then they reached the creation of the first virtual operator and others joined them.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are running from one another all the way to the other as a huge patent.
For our experience we cannot be relieved of the feeling that the lack of clarity of competence in these cases makes it more comfortable.
But we won't win the jump.
If the feedback information is correct and the virtual operator will really appear soon from us, the Czech mobile phone market will be back on the motorcycle.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only difficultly UOHS could remain insensitive to the refusal (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling for higher prices than for the rest of Europe.
The new Czech ink has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech National Inno.
Sunday's Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, on the occasion of the Czech State's recognition Day, presented the new registrations of the national name "Kde dodomov myj".
The new registration of the Inno was made by the Orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available – assole with male or female voice, choir step and instrumental edition.
The canto is under the direction of Kateřina Knížínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the inno revisions are Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz website you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful sisters.
He had already told the radio "Český rrhlas" that he chose to sing the variants alone, the songs with the most representative young songs, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to take care that both the heart and the heart, they have the clear statement, that the text is very understandable, that they are in harmony," he said.
Then the national wedding will be held next year at 175^ anniversary.
The song "Where my home" was sung for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh feast in the original opera Fidlovačka of Josef Kajetán Til accompanied by the music of Frantisek Škroupa.
He has acquired popularity, and people have done it spontaneously.
The first break of the song after the foundation of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became the natural part of the national song.
It remains one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the Czech Republic.
How the "new" mother sounds
Prague's MHD Wednesday will accompany you for the first time with an electronic tesser.
On Wednesday 1 October 2008, it will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which the first passengers on the subway, tram and bus will arrive that instead of the ticket will have an electronic tesser.
At this moment you can search for it about a hundred people who own their OpenCard chair.
The passengers can buy that 30 and 90 days and annual (which will take place from the first January 2009) and at the same time download their card in Infopoints and in the Transport Company offices and at the stop of the Museum, Móstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Andël, Roztyly, Lettyny, Kobylisy, Rajská Zahrad, Kacherov and Luka.
Dealers can already buy online from the Transport Company page www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers benefited from the service before breakfast.
Those who start using the Internet service can completely forget sports in the metro stops where they had to make long files for the ticket tickets.
The drawing is purchased online and on Opencard is loaded on one of the twelve branches of the municipal library.
"In these places passengers have a personal-format sports hall that will help the people in the purchase on the Internet and will even record on their card the credit bought." said project spokesman Martin Opatrní.
In addition, in libraries you will be able to load the electronic sizes on Opencards in Bancomat and self-service that are installed at the entrances of the metro.
How are these banks?
They are red, dreaming of the ticket's obligators and passengers have already noticed them at the stops of the Roztyly, Budéjoviká, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in the whole city but by the end of the year which should be achieved," Opatrní concluded.
The drawing will be controlled rather than from the auction of the banknote.
The banking service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the OpenCard bag and before payment of the cut, you will be loaded up.
The electronic tessers will come tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
This is in the urban lines of trains and buses from 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the central Bohemian municipalities take to reach the capital.
"In trains added to the integrated transports of Prague, there are coined card readers who verify time and zone validity," he explained the mode of control of the Filip tickets by the Ropid organisation, which sets the hours of collective transport in Prague.
Urban buses have the books of integrated cards in the author's case.
During the trip it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the author, but, more importantly, to support the Opencard at a specific point next to the house.
Thus the author verifys the validity of the loaded cuts.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of loaded sizes, there is nothing more easy to ask the author about this type of information," Drapal added.
Travellers who take the urban buses and will not remember, when the validity of the drawing is reduced, can return to the self-service Bancomat, where the cuts are loaded on the card.
Here you will see information on the validity of their documents on the display of the device.
The Germans of the South wanted a referendum from the United States
The Germans of the Sudan in 1945 asked to include Zumava in the United States.
This is from the letter deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the pattern of the United States.
With this desire, according to what is said, some groups of Germans from the Sudan turned to the president of the United States in 1945.
This is more than the letter preserved in a private archive and is now stored in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in the letter to the American President not to allow the return of the "Sumava district" – occupied by Hitler under the Monaco agreement – to Czechoslovakia.
"We understand the situation and we want to be sure of the promises that the American units come to the German territory, not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," wrote in a letter signed with the words "The people who are at the destination of Shumava with all their heart."
Because, they say, the annex to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Germans of the Sudan only hope for brutality, lack of relations, 'incompetence, oppression and slavery', the authors of the letter ask the American President to take up the protection against Shumava now and forever.
"We cannot believe that without regard to the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you will recognize this territory as a foreign state, which oppresses and devastates ethnic minorities and has not contributed to anything, for nothing, to the victory of the Allies," writes the letter.
The reason why the authors can't sign it is the alleged fear of the sales site by the "czek printers".
If the president of the United States had to doubt the conviction of the Germans of Shuumava , it would be sufficient to organize a referendum in the district on the desire of its inhabitants to become part of the United States or to live under the United States' sovereignty.
Although the text of the letter may seem strange to our knowledge of the history of the post-war era, according to some witnesses, it adequately describes the expectations of the Germans of the Sudanese.
Although the Germans had to at least intune that they would have been moving from the Republic, only a few of them accepted the possibility of the whole kind.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate a sort of autonomy for the people of the South.
Others thought that they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budéjovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Budéjovice in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and placed in the prison camp in Holštýn , dozens of other German Czechs went to find him so that he could teach the Czech.
"These thought that once he came home the Czech would have made him comfortable," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners, who were seen in Czechoslovakia during the war, said he was aware that on the basis of Benez's orders they would have been transferred from the Republic.
Don't think about it!
The emotional campaign will attack authors
The most expensive action in Czech history addressed to road safety.
It is also possible to define the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to move from Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Rébíček expects this to discourage drivers from a dangerous behaviour to the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet but also on volunteers.
Authors should be encouraged by the quick guide and by the effect of alcohol on the fly.
And remind them also to put the belt before starting.
He wants to touch in consciousness especially young authors, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not professional leaders.
What's going to happen in the spot?
Especially the stories of people who will affect emotions.
And this also testifies to the "sanguous" slogan of the entire campaign:
Don't think about it!
The word "do not think" is written mostly on the targae.
And in a blood bag, there's the word "fashioned."
This must symbolize that a person can in a spirit of entertainment pay with his own life.
The spots will "spaventer" the spectators until 2010.
The ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can be seen with tragic scenes of the victims of accidents.
It is thus promised to reduce the number of incidents and deaths on the Czech roads.
The spot was prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Streets And Alleys
"The carat and cotton system works with the authors.
The carrot for them is for example when they pass with red and thus save time.
The bacon is the danger of the plague or the accident.
You need to remember the risk to drivers," says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Kořán of the Na Homelce hospital.
And that's why we want information campaigns in the press and especially negative publicity, he thinks the psychologist.
According to him, the panels that warn the users of the danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel has been installed warning of the danger, it will probably meet with the environment soon and the leaders will not pay any more attention to it," Korán warned.
Olmert would restore almost all the territories occupied in exchange for peace
The prime minister of the Israeli provisional government, Ehud Olmert, expressed concern at the return of practically all the territories occupied in 1967, namely the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the heights of Golan, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
That's what he said in the dialogue that he published on Monday, the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to restore almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," said Olmert to the daily.
"We will have a certain percentage of these territories but the Palestinians will have to leave the same percentage (of Israeli areas), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He approved that any refund would also include East Jerusalem .
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, doesn't want the Russians or the spyists to take the passports, as happened to one of my best friends, to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in the scene at the two attacks of July in the city, during which some people were killed and ten people were wounded.
According to the prime minister it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mountain, sacred and historical places", which are within the Old City. .
"Whoever wants to maintain Israel's sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270 000 Arab.
This won't work," he also stressed.
The retreat from the heights of Golan
Olmert also spoke for Israel's withdrawal from Golan's heights, i.e. the necessary condition to conclude this peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort by Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up in order to get the heights of Golan.
They will have to give up the current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the Hezbollah (the Sciti Movement); they will have to give up their permanent support, which they offer to the terrorism of Hamas, (the Sciati Movement) of Al-Qaida (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Ask after the incident: Are the drivers illegal in the buses?
The law does not recognize them, you can't walk on the bus that goes long.
In the context of the tragic incident near the Italian city of Padova of the student agency's pulman of the company, the question was raised whether the Stewarts and passengers can move on the bus during the course.
"If we want to respect the laws seriously and formally, the work of the Stewart is in conflict with the road traffic law," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanselka.
The incident last week with which a 22-year-old host died was caused by a truck that cut the road to the pulman.
The girl was sadly sitting next to the author at the less secure spot of the pulman, although there were still two other places assigned.
But the bus can make an accident or freeze in cold weather even at the time of the distribution of coffee or newspapers.
Depends on whether the bus is equipped or less than foot-and-mouthed according to the driving licence.
If not approved, passengers must be seated.
The Student Agency's buses did not stand on foot, confirmed it on Aktuáln.cz's website, the director of Radim Jançura.
"We assessed this with the Ministry and at first did not allow passengers to move on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the course if they have assigned the place," he expressed his point of view.
The law doesn't recognize the Stewart.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the Stewart – no law deals with the regulation of this role."
No regulation, however, prevents the carrier from carrying out the services.
The road traffic law recognises only the accompanying term of the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," adds less clearly the spokesman Hanzelka.
The Director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorní, however, considers that the law is sufficient to deal with this problem.
Depends on whether the bus has the approved feet.
Everything," he says.
Category the buses in urban areas where there are foot stations and the maximum speed, interurbans with foot stations with higher and longer speeds without foot stations with the maximum permitted speed and seating equipped with safety belts.
As an airplane, says the expert.
The BESSIP expert on road safety Jaroslav Horín found no background problem in the movement of the train's strengths on the bus.
"During a quiet course there are not so many dangers, the situation can be compared to the air service.
Even there it is safe when a turbulence arrives and the flight attendant can break his head."
"If the bus makes a broken brake, obviously the laws of physics are void.
Just like the urban pulman or the tram.
The carrier must resolve the safety of the Stewarts with an internal regulation," he also says and understands that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jancura is willing to suspend the services.
Student Agency is the only transport that offers the services of the Stewarts..
This doesn't take about two hundred.
The Director even after the incident considers their mission dangerous.
"I will not only have the sense of having to consider the profession of the Stewart as dangerous work, I will cancel it.
Passengers can get coffee and newspapers while they go out.
It would also reduce the costs," he says.
Asian director Alexej Litvin, who manages a group of lines with regard to the Student Agency, has caused the absence of Stewart on his means as an interest in security.
"We don't have any enemies, we've been fighting from the beginning.
Before or after it will end with a fatal accident," said less than a year ago Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy has taken place.
In the incident of the line for Naples, a young hostess from the Plzeň region, who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck is probably out of the emergency course without using the frequency and has blocked the road to the pulman.
The pulman's driver tried to avoid him with a dirty handle, but he hit him with the front right.
Jançura refused to take up the two positions reserved for the stawarts.
"It is not possible to book these places in long-term pulman, they are reliable."
The dentist is thinking of accusing the driver of the truck.
The Agency will not wait for the Court's judgment to pay the damage to the girl's family, but a financial compensation is expected from the offender.
The revision of the law?
No view
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to clarifying the movement of train drivers.
"They have not achieved any concrete results, however.
They don't think they're so pulmanized, they're more occupied with the rating system, maximum speed on the highway and use of the cell phone during the guide," says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider Stewart's activity to be a major threat to passenger safety," concludes Porter Havelka, that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and security offices.
Düsseldorf's hopes point to Francoforte
The words are not missing in the letter of the Director of WestLB addressed to the staff of the house.
In the letter published on Monday that could form "the capital market centre of the financial group's savings accounts" through the meeting of the unit of the Düsseldorf banking institution with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt.
West LB would launch "a competent block" with sustainable profits in such a company.
In addition, all such a union could be a decisive incentive for further links in the Länder banking sector.
That is how it is read when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the ability to act.
Because the WestLB strike is still under severe pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also through the National Financial Monitoring Service Service Entrepreneurship, noting time ago to the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time is limited to looking for a future solution.
I have a link between the Deka-Bank, which the same customers of the Risparmio Case because of their investment funds are already known, and WestLB is probably already talking about it for a while, even from Frankfurt.
At the end of August, the head of the Deka-Bank Franz Waas referred to the act of presenting the invoice of the first half of the year that a merger of the house near Magonza with a national bank such as the Helaba or the West LB did not make sense.
However, the Deca Administrative Council, which has been brought by regional banks and savings funds, has delegated to the Management Board to negotiate with the West LB on common contracts.
It could be market negotiations or parts of them.
But the discussions have, as they say in the square of business, just started.
From the Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees, is one of those who are more involved in business in Frankfurt, not talking about it the first time it is trying to consolidate the rescue case sector.
In 2003, for a short period, it seemed that the Deka-Bank could be founded with the regional bank of Renania-Palatinate and Helaba.
Of this three-way association, there's nothing to do with it.
As soon as the projects were published, the Asian regional bank was opposed to the participation of Helaba.
The remaining two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The regional bank of Renania-Palatinate went instead to the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stockholm.
However, they have often thought about a merger of the Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But finally Günther Merl, president of the Helaba Board of Directors, expresses himself against planning games to meet with his house.
On the other hand, it seems that knowledge is created, that it is necessary to approach the various houses of the public sector.
Since Parliament's election has passed, a meeting of the Landesbank could be held with the Baden-Württemberg.
For Helaba it's not all good news.
If pressure increases for other mergers, the partners will lose their hands.
In the South we would now have the young partner, although it has so far exceeded the much better financial crisis of the houses in Monaco and Stockholm.
The Association of Assia-Turingia Saving Cases, which participates in 85 percent of Helaba, placed the cathence at the meeting with the WestLB.
Only NordLB would remain
These geo-strategic reasons are just one account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the various business models of individual houses are combined.
In June Merl pointed out that the decisive question, with which the future of regional banks would be assured, would not have been a response from the German savings fund association.
In the end, the West LB division may also come out, which is of course not wanted.
Thus, the letter of the Board of Directors expresses the desire to appeal in any case to a "general solution".
You will see how the reunification of the individual parties with the Deka-Bank works.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena is the first time while for Luca is the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a partner, and so says everything is different.
Behind them at the 5l bar of the Kaiser brand is a massive bar and shows about 200 visitors who are the deep tones that can produce from the gorge.
Elena first gives Luca a pack and then a bag.
I'm from Bologna to Verona.
From here to bus parking near Porta Nuova station, this evening comes at 23.45 4 passengers with Monaco destination, Festival of Birra", arriving at 6.30 p.m.
Three corridors are reserved especially for Italians, in another Brazilian only.
In a park corner, the South Americans are singing with the flag in hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It's so funny, says Marco, that's not something for Italians.
Mark that brings a long cap with fake film feeder and a couple of glasses with large silver bars belong to the buses.
From 5 years to October, this year is 3 trips.
The night shift, every day at the party, returns to 22.30.
Nighting would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euro includes travel, the welcome of the Brindisi with the Kaiser beer, made in accordance with the basic rules of generosity, the disease case and the German guide – Marco has attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave around the Brenner.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly the silence falls in the bus, the passengers sleep.
Better, they'll still need their strengths.
They stop in Bressane and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian flag on the A9 highway prior to Monaco take a short break.
When, as planned, the group of Marco arrives at 6.30 in the parking area near Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are grouped together, Marco explains for the last time the attack program.
First: put the yellow cap.
On the left there is "Oktoberfest" following the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Conoscersiviaddo.it".
Second: "When they open the doors of the beer tent means running!" says Marco of the first morning.
"Corree!" ran and occupied the back of the tent.
"Don't go ahead, but we're blocking, and not all the yellow berths sit on the same panties, divide into the appropriate space!"
The bottle costs 8,25 Euro, gold Marco.
And don't forget to give the butter.
"Show the security service, we behave well!
As soon as you leave the places, they will perish."
Third: "At 22.30 p.m. we'll meet again here! Understand?"
He's already leaving for the party.
On the road one attacks as follows the yellow verrets to the trees, to the street folders and even to a public folder of a large bavare popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the festival, known as "the Italian weekend".
There are no accurate data, there are 50 miles, which are born to pass through the Alps and invasive the tendons, it is claimed that 10% of visitors come from Italy.
Monaco's police are strengthened with 7 High Adige agents, Italian volunteers support the bavarese red cross, which makes a statistics on nationality, where Italians first have 200 medical treatments in front of the English (about 60 medical care) and Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by the Italians is the Hofbräuhaus tendon.
1. Nights of sleep for the creditors of the Real Estate Hippo
The German banking system is relatively stable, confirmed by the Minister for Finance Peer Steinbrück last week.
It is good that policy has used the word "relative" and has also stressed that the German banking sector is not spared from critical developments.
Because the crisis is starting at the end of the week.
The real estate funder Hippo Real Estate, noted in the DAX, receives from a German banking firm a billionaire credit to protect themselves from market disturbances.
One expert on the situation said to Reuters on Monday, the support credits would reach up to EUR 35 billion.
The Real Estate Hypo should only pay interest for the requested party.
Money comes from private banks and from the public.
In the background are the losses of the Defa affiliate.
According to a newspaper article, the State funder has been refinanced in a short term – which is no longer possible because of market reliance.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserves were reduced by 95% to EUR 2.37 million, and the share of the capital itself was delivered from 1.6 to 1.45.
The current income and net income from financial transactions have fallen to 0 compared to last year, the benefits from both demand and certain actions as regards the liquidation of loans have decreased by more than 70% over EUR 5 million.
Only due to higher income from the reimbursement of sub-ordered compensation costs resulting from both the restructuring of the former Defa group and the reimbursement of interest under the single text of the tax laws and business management, the negative profit has been sufficiently moderate by about 16%.
The former public funder after being privatised in 1990 was lost in speculation with commercial real estate loans, which were deposited in the Aareal Bank.
Since the income in the classic state funding was too low, the Defa has become more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint private and state investors (PPP) projects and has been internationally diversified.
The Real Estate Hypo must now destroy the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group's profit and loss account.
The fact is, the dividends have been cancelled.
Already in 2007, 2/3 were reduced.
The Real State Hypo after the use of the Defa is an important beneficiary of state and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on refinancing on the market between banks than other institutions, because it does not have customer trust deposits.
Due to the collapse of the American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the grant of loans between banks in most cases was exhausted because banks accumulated liquidity.
The Real Estate Hypo every year is required for part of the Defa credit portfolio – about 50 billion – in short terms the funding means.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financial requirement was covered by the credit for a certain period and the company was protected from the influence of international monetary markets for the most non-functional.
In other sources it is felt that, thanks to the money, the refinancing is ensured until the end of 2009.
The Chairman of the HRE Steering Committee, George Funke, on the other hand, said that the HRE Group would not need the monetary markets for a short time.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Monitoring Service Service (BaFin) are based on the fact that the marketability of the HRE group is still ensured.
This is expected for the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
In view of the dynamic and impoverishability of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
It is possible that the funding will not be fully used.
But the opposite is also not to be excluded.
After Sunday night, the bank as soon as it was caught was to fail, the immediate rescue failed to calm the souls.
The share rate rose from 75% to 3.30 euros.
They're pretty good with the rides of the walls.
As long as the previous debt is almost irreplaceable, the post-posted credit courses are awarded.
In particular, the mutatis mutandis of the Württemberg-Hypo affiliate are clearly due to declines over 2009.
First, the Della HREs seemed to have an alternative investment, and now their validity must, after strengthening the bank and institution's own crisis, which in the wake of the Defa crisis, should be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
Until the central banks, governments and less affected banks are still ready, it can be counted on an amortisation of the years within the deadline.
After all, what no one is looking forward to – the financial crisis will be overrun within the next 15 months.
However, concerning information which is incompatible with partial statistics, the probability is almost certain that a justified hope has become.
In particular, it will create for long-term investors some nights inconsistencies with the decision to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors may conclude the report of losses for future payments of the countervailing duty on surpluses.
Sylvana and Bento-Box secrets
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, the first day of school should be presented to the Tachiban High School, the girls start laughing: The German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas-nel new Japanese exchange log.
The first day of school in Japan
How I felt.
I just had to go to school.
I stayed on the streets of Tokyo to Kawasaki and needed 40 minutes by train to reach Tachibana High School.
The way I had to find me alone and luckily, I didn't lose.
The beginning of the first hour of lesson does not seem to have been set as well as by us in Bassa Sassonia.
The schools arrived on the plane from 8 to then, until 8.40 a short conversation with the teacher, the so-called "home room".
But before I started the lesson, I was moved to introduce myself.
I'm not the guy who speaks volunteerly in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 schools.
Since I had not yet had the school uniform, I was put on an old guest mother's gun, along with a shirt, blue pants and black leather shoes.
This dress I put in front of the cathedral, and I tried to say well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - I'm called Sylvana, I come from Germany and party for a week in my birthday.
At that time I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls of the class were dressed, dressed and made signs and I heard the word "Kawaii".
That's what I already knew from my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lesbian of Japanese girls to survive and means "carino, sweet".
Then I run fast to my place.
The girl next to me had a smile, for her it was an honor to sit next to a place of exchange.
The rest of the lesson time was continued calmly, but when he sounded the gong, they were assailed in the true sense of the word.
They all spoke dissolutely and laughed at me and followed me with questions – then it's really hard to understand the English of the Japanese.
In the pause everyone opened their Bento.
My host mother just made me the planner for the Lunch-- is different from the new German panties.
I had grown up with species, salsicines, cetriol insulation and algae, fruit and a species of insects with meat and tofu..
To tell the truth, I don't even know what I eat exactly in Japan.
Things look strange and have a completely new taste.
Actually, it's, it's really good.
Maybe except the powders put under the salts, brr!
The Bento are not just lunch for Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a Bento made of herself, prepared artificially, with the hope of making the boy know during the recreation.
I read it in my Manga smoke.
I'm really curious if I can find out.
"Why is Japan really?" my friends asked me when I told them, that I would have wanted to go to school in Japan for a year.
I always said,
'Cause I'm fascinated
Finally, I've been reading Mangas for years.
And in order to better understand the smoke and culture that they contain, I began to learn some Japanese.
I was absolutely convinced that we would come once.
I also admire tradition, customs and customs.
There's a lot of them here.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and last trends - on the other hand against: severe, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
1. Even rats have feelings
A rat or a scarf flees when they feel danger.
The scientist Joseph Le Doux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
4. But how can you see if, when they behave in our own way, they have our own feelings?
On the Internet journal "Edge" has been published for some years by scientists.
6. SPIELL ONLINE in a series presents chosen answers to the question: "What do you think it is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove it, since we can't even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to other species and ask questions about feeling or conscience in general, we enter an improbable territory, because the reference base does not fight.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, he does the same things that other animals do. That is to be killed, escaped or attacked.
People behave in a similar way, from where some scientists realize that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe this.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult for us to convey our feelings to animals.
On the one hand, it is often associated with the lateral pre-frontal cortex with human consciousness, associated circuits (this for their direct participation in the short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this wide area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely lacking.
For at least in those aspects of our consciousness dependent on the pre-frontal cortex, including the knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the foundation is thus accepted on the assumption that man differs even from the other primates.
Another dramatic particularity should be presented in the way of human speech: since a large part of life is connected to language, it is often said that it is related to conscience.
In this case animals may be excluded.
Although awareness does not depend on language, it would influence it in such a way that the consciousness of the animal, as it is done, certainly differs greatly from the circumstances of our conscience.
That is why it is difficult to find out how conscience can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, by analyzing it through your own experience due to the special hardware, their research will cause serious problems.
Most of the interpretations refer to the content of the conscious experience, but on the other hand there is another aspect of the consciousness to which science would be more easily accessible.
They could analyze the processes of the conscience of animals without regard to their content, and that is what happens in studies on the short memory of primates, especially for the example of visualization.
So for this principle, that Christof Koch und Francis Crick follows, he first goes to the neural correlations of the consciousness that cause mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the pre-frontal cortex for the implementation of the visualization.
So, what's this about feelings?
I urge them that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of their brain conscious activities.
What we indicate as "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) takes up the memory of work.
Such feelings are closely linked to the regions of the cortex, which characterize primates and, in particular, human beings.
With the speaking nature they create subtle sensations of feeling, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
In this respect, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings are more primitive in the regions of the body of the senses of the cortex and the crown of the head, similar to Jack Pankseep, who, however, is more focused on the paleocephalo.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could make it absolutely part of the feelings extended to the species.
At the purely theoretical level, I can't counter it, but I think it's inexhaustible.
Pankseep makes arguments about the fact that what appears to rats and human beings as fear is likely to happen with both senses in both cases: but how can you verify if rats and human beings try the same thing when they behave in a similar way?
A scarfing in case of danger escapes as if he felt afraid?
In my eyes, the simple pattern of behavior can still not show any vital harmony.
And that's what the neural comparison continues to be of help: rats and humans have similar paleoencephals, the scarfs don't even have a brain.
But the paleoencefalo is responsible for the feelings?
And when you can also prove it for human beings: how would you like to show it on the rats?
I think the rats and other mammals, maybe the insects (who knows ?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (when human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study the emotional behavior rather than the emotional feelings of the rats.
In any case, there are developments at the core level, in agreement with the same procedure on rats and men.
As I don't look at language and consciousness in rats, so I don't do it on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This may be thought to be miope, but I prefer to take steps forward instead of constantly breaking up a wall.
I'm for the point, I'm an emotional one.
President of UEFA Platini: return to Poland and Ukraine
The vice-president Ivan Wasjunik said that preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of the Uefa in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise Europeans with Poland," said Wasjunik
"This, however, is not an amnesty for our country.
Work is just started and there is still much to do in both countries"
Both home home countries are sophisticated in the March table for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports.
The number of stages to be allocated to the Europeans will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't lose any more time.
Now we must work at the maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian Association Grigorij Surkis.
"the UEFA will always have us eye."
A more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the management of the Polish PZPN association was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced with independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"the serious danger that PZPN is not able to operate in accordance with the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish PAP Information Agency.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that the preparation at EM 2012 will not suffer."
A number of exponents of the first division only in the last season have been convicted for manipulation, and in the end, they had to leave the beginning of the Law.
Dennis Quaid's angered cut.
He wanted to promote a new film, in the interview he spoke of the private and now he has gran with the ex: Hollywood Meg Ryan's star declared his ex Dennis Quaid an adult.
He's getting angry with the cutter.
The war of the Roses was delayed for the former couple of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation, the two actors of Hollywood now argue with each other about a serious dispute - in public.
Meg Ryan, in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week for the first time, expressed himself on the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis has been to me long infatuated, and this has been very painful."
The scope of the traditions would have come to know it only after the separation.
The occasion for the "smoothing of the soul" was the work with Ryan's print for his new film "The Women" – the story of an adult is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to her being publicly declared as an adult husband was clear: it would be "inaudible", said the fifty-fourth train to "New York Daily News", which "Meg for the first time repeats and reproduces the story of our relationship".
It would also be "deplore" that Jack, the seven-year-old son who had been together, would again "not remember the pain and subversive, which means a separation for every child."
While Ryan lives alone, Quaid is newly married and will soon become a father of twins.
And so his judges close with the frequency: "My life in every case is going forward.
I think I'm lucky to have a wonderful family where everything is going for the best."
Prices for air tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008 flights and nights in Europe were more economical than last year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would reach up to 50% more economical
Flights and nights at the hotel have become more convenient - this is the result of a study by the financial provider and American Express travel.
The company analysed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, observed a clear decline in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have been increased for years, nights in many places are already high.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities still under review averaged around 6.9 compared to 2007
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 % lower than the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year ago.
The American Express sees as a reason for this the poor dollar quota, which would have led to a "excellent desire to travel with American tourists"
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the price reduction of hotels in a stronger way than industrial centres such as Hannover, Colonia or Stavanger.
In the city of Norway, the hotel prices with an increase of 26.3% are due to the record in Europe.
Even with regard to flight prices, the trend in the first quarter is still above:
Due to the decline in the Cherosene, the economic class passengers had to pay on average 7.1% compared to 2007, long-range fuel flights would be added up to 29.2% more expensive
From April to June the prices of the Economic Class air tickets were averaged by 12.5 % compared to the previous quarter, the price changes in the first class and Business were much longer.
In Germany prices are even stronger than in other European countries:
From January to March prices fell from 11.9 %, and the second quarter dropped from 23.6 %.
As for the German internal flights according to the study, prices have been reduced.
The reason for the price collapse would be partly economic growth, explains the company.
The request in many segments of the air travel market has been rejected.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure on competition by the agreement on open skyscrapers, which liberalises the air traffic between the US and Europe.
The critical situation would be the abolition of non-refundable contracts at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 had declared failure – only 24 airlines were treated in Europe.
HSV beats Gladbach for 1 to 0
With a simple goal and method, the VV of Amburg becomes a capolilist.
There is still no group of 11 that works in the Luhukay area.
Kristoffer Klein here is worse on the luck landing for the national marko marin player.
The Gladbach player first entered the game late and failed with a shot on the cross
His message was accurately formulated, passed on the lips in a convincing way.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the hall hall of Amburg.
It didn't happen big in the catacombs, the game break was over and most of the seat again in its place.
Rieger has been for nearly 3 decades HSV physiotherapy, enjoys an even greater estimate of some old players.
And so his monitor also found his ear in the higher spheres.
The assistant alleviator Cornelius Jol announced and raised the pollice for approval.
Cornelius is the brother of the mayor of Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded like this: here's the second goal!
The change in position has not been verified.
"Today it wasn't all good to see," admitted Marcel Jansen later.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have been "more relaxed".
For 1 to zero those in Amburg should thank the head hit by Mladen Petric (11) and the fact that many weak Gladbach players could not hurt the weak players in Hamburg.
"It was a big victory," said Martin Jol.
Amburg's SV this Monday will be 121 years old.
The spectators have already celebrated before, on the afternoon of the Sabbath, if themselves, the blue sky on the sand and the shining classification on the video-sherm, which has legitimized their sports society as before the class.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"we are able to put everything in place," said Marcell Jansen.
It has the present, that the provisional certificate from table is more indication of the impreplicability of the champion than of the domination of its HSV.
The team with its new arrivals later introduced – the Brazilian Neves und Silva, Petric port defender as well as Jansen supported by the FC Bayern – finds it slowly, but it is not yet able to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more Dribling," relief with force Jol.

The dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years a mysterious phenomenon created perplexity among scientists: the dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by manoeuvre.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be the exact thing.
Ulysses' space probe has flew through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the burning of the fuel that quickly freezes, death for freezing now falls on you.
Among scientists over the years a mysterious phenomenon creates a complication – the anomaly of Swing-by
The Swing-by is a flight of space probes, with which they get additional slant/spin/scillation in the gravitational field of a heavenly body, for example the Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical expedition as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What the students have been doing for years: the races don't behave the way we would expect under the gravity law.
Before it comes to irregularity at speeds.
The probes become faster or slower.
So far the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year was abolished by Swing-by's anomaly.
Some experts fear that the general theory of Albert Einstein's relativity, which describes the force of attraction of the matter with a curvature of the space, may not be the exact thing.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study firmly believes as before Einstein did not fail, and tries to explain the anomaly of Swing-by through the so-called dark matter that astronomers have warned in space.
"The responsibility of the anomaly could be the dark matter which could also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
From the existence of the dark matter, the students in the space are known for only about 10 years.
There is obviously a force of attraction from you, whose effect on other heavenly bodies is seen.
Instead of everything invisible, it means that you do not send or reflect any sort of electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, the dark matter is at least a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Rape tourists in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their sequencors, the tourists in Egypt would be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The refugees from the Sudan had asked for several million euros of cash.
In a shooting before the release of 6 sequentials, they were killed.
In the south of Egypt, 5 Germans were kidnapped.
The rescheduling treaties are already in progress.
The Germans are always at the mercy of the sequencists.
WELT Online describes the most important cases.
European tourists in Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was consistent with Egyptian state television, the Arab publisher Al-Arabia and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our fellows and other hostages have been released
We're examining their health status," Frattini said.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions would be in good health and safety, he referred to Egyptian state television.
The 19 components of a expedition in the desert are already on their way to Cairo.
There is still little clarity about the retreat of a shooting that occurred before the release of the hostages: therefore the kidnappers after the instructions of an Egyptian public security officer would have been ready to finish the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army was killed by a surprise of 6 of them.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed for a ransom," said the officer.
It would be "still just trying to bring the hostages in", when this surprise came in.
The Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had been killed by gun attacks from 6 of their kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
Securators had claimed a sum of EUR 6 million from Germany; the money should have been delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" referred to a German mediator, the release of the hostages would be delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the sequentials wanted to release women in detention after the ransom was paid.
Men would have to be treated until the kidnappers had had a safe escape route.
The German ambassador to Cairo refused a position on the report .
The abuses of the mother's "smoothing to murder"
Years of abuse by the wife have led a woman to kill herself, she has declared a court.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, of Stithians, Cornovaglia, was in prison for 6 years after he admitted eight cases of sexual aggression.
The Court of Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly disturbed his daughter, Stephanie Randle, when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession note: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle had been killed in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and living in Conventry, Trerise sold her and sold her before having sex, while the mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornovaglia.
His daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs Randle, who had spent a lot of time as a volunteer to the National Trust, was tortured by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, the Public Minister Ramsey Quaife told the court that Mrs. Randle's friends, who had been a brave surfer and cyclist, were "emotionally dead", and had "died with life".
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
He thinks he's killed by suffocating himself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's mother, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: "The League and the Trader".
"I didn't bother him sexually.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "She is an extremely strange fetisher, and for her victim she must have been terrifying, especially when she was only seven years old.
"This dreadful saga ends with the victim who takes his life.
Even harder is the fact that if he hadn't done it, it would have been difficult to finish the facts before the court."
I know the effects Stephanie’s father and mother had on their daughter in these years.
"Others were clearly likely to have been a promising and happy young success."
The officer who lost the data will be shot.
The branch office that left the top-secret documents on a train in June has to be charged by the Official Secrets Act, has acquired the BBC.
The man was transferred from the Ministry of Defence when he left two highly classified documents on the train for Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were sent to the police.
It is the least delicate of the charges made under this law and there is nothing that suggests a criminal attempt.
The BBC defence representative Frank Gardner said that the movement would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
"They will have thought that this was dealt with internally at the Mode and the Office of the Office," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is to be charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, the information protection clause.
The Crown Prosecution Service has recommended that the officer be charged by the metropolitan police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The documents that were lost contained assessments on al-Qaaeda and the capacity of Iraq's security forces.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was taken from his home and taken to a hidden place.
Construction companies face the B&B account
The English construction companies could face an account of over £80 million after saving Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has given 14 billion stars to protect the 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savings deposits.
The interest on that loan will be paid by all companies taking the money of the savings companies, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it's "excited" that companies and their members have to pay.
The loan of 14 billion sterline will be repatriated if Bradford & Bingley's walls are rescinded.
But the interest which will grow in time will be paid every year to 700 financial companies that take deposits, but the interest that will grow in time will be due each year to 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It's irritating that those institutions that have acted wisely... are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasure estimates that the interest in the loan will amount to 450 million esters in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find 81 million stars to pay for the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Construction Company Association, told BBC that he thinks it is wrong.
"It is irritating that those institutions that have acted prudently in the house-keeping market are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been far less prudent."
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the documentation began in 1945.
"We must examine all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options are available to protect construction companies and their members from what might be a significant account," said Mr Cole.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of a whole year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organisations without shareholders, their members end up paying the account through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
The milk salts at 5 penny per litre
The people in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that there will be an increase in the price of her milk for an extra of five pennies per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-penny increase in February, and comes after a research carried out by a consulting company.
Vendors must decide whether they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the increase in February, the price for the increase changed for the last time in 2002.
Refusal of custody to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladesh court has rejected a defence request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that she could be arrested when she comes back to the country.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to grant them a warrant for issuing 50 million tachographs ($729,700) to a businessman when he was a member of Parliament.
The case is one of the many accusations of corruption against you.
The long-term political rival of Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail at the beginning of the month.
The return to Bangladesh of Sheikh Hasina is scheduled for the next week but his party, Awami League, asked that the temporary government of the country supported by the military should be free of charge the next day.
The respondents say that while you were going abroad for medical care on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of your release, if you can remain free when you return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The High Court has rejected the request for security for Sheikh Hasina, adding that she cannot have custody since she is already abroad on medical care," says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We shall present or appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs caution to return to the country from the outside to prepare the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina's home is expected to return after 17 October, said a senior leader of the Awami League party Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the government joined the military force took power, but was released in June, to go abroad to receive medical care.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all accusations against themselves.
Fear for the Afghan anti-polo campaign
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan lack the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, says the United Nations.
The United Nations has advanced a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
But it is said that you can't reach children in the part of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
One UN spokesman said that this happened despite the promises of Talibans that would not have attacked or prevented thousands of staff from carrying vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission's decision to force the company to reduce its participation in the TV show.
BSkyB was told by the Competition Appeal Court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had said that BSkyB's participation had hindered competition and had allowed an unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB agreed to participate in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB's share in ITV raises doubts about the independence of ITV, making the Competition Commission launch an investigation.
The head of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the regulator of Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stack was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy--particularly as BSkyB had said it would surprise its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of the US Prosecutor
The U.S. Attorney-General has appointed a Special Public Ministry to examine the licensing of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation shall take place when a report on the case is made by the Director-General of the Department of Justice critical of the actions of the administrative officers.
The report was critical to the White House, the legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was made out of fear that the prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special Minister Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials questioned during the investigation have lied to the investigators in an attempt to stop justice.
"Several accusations of potentially criminal behaviour have not been fully investigated or cleared," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special minister with the power to restrict witnesses to witness was one of the main recommendations.
The debate began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department said that lawyers had been licensed for slow performance.
But later it appeared that the licensed lawyers were no longer valued more than many other colleagues, bringing many observers to the conclusion that the licensing was motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors were involved in the judicial action against the Republican members of the High-profile Congress, while others refused to investigate the charge of fraud against democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and bringing forward cases in court on government account.
They can be licensed at any time, but can not be licensed for political reasons.
The then head of the Department of Justice, the Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was found in the storm for licences, and finally identified his position.
A number of other officials of the Department of Justice were licensed.
(The report of the Inspector-General was very critical in the role of Mr Gonzales in the case, saying that he had a primary responsibility in the licensings, which he had attached to his leadership and had been extremely distinguished during the process.
Other officials, including former senior assistant Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigations.
The Epic of Meat Loaf will be celebrated
The rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at Q Awards for his epic inno's Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold prize to the ceremony next week in London, said to be "honored" to win recognition.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album hit by Meat Loaf in 1977.
Coldplay will run nominations for this year's prizes, being in the list of appointments in four categories.
Paul Rees, chief editor of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that trace things like time and kind, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of those."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocality that was provided by the Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrument section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was performed as a single in UK in 1979 and reached the fifteenth place.
But Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell's album remained almost nine years in classification and came to sell more than 40 million copies in the world.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including an intervention for an irregular heart beat in 2003.
In 2007, acute laryngitis was restricted to cancellations and concerts.
It turns out later that she had a censorship on a vocal string.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon to be sold
New York City has thousands of adventures, bulevards, roads and other crossings, some famous, others just for use.
But many veteran taxi drivers and residents have long found it difficult to give the position of Extra Place, especially because they have never heard of it.
The lower road is in the East Village and goes north from the First Street – without making the Second Road – between Bowery and Avenue Second.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it resembles more than a powdery violet than an active road traffic.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal Atlantic.
The road must, however, have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of luxury buildings recently built on the First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner pass for shops and shops that should open in new buildings.
Other admirers include long-term neighbors who say they were hit by the road just because it was one of the last remnants of the Missile Square of the past.
But the city's conservation and development department, which has control of the streets, is not interested in having it.
During a meeting of the Committee on the Use of the Land of the Communiqué, some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay have drawn up a proposal for the real estate company to buy the way.
But the committee prefers that the road remain in the city's hands, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, director of the Community Board 3.
"There is very little space left to the property of the city, and we would like the city to continue to possess Extra Place," he said.
"There may be proposals to system and manage it, which may be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay many months ago announced wanting to open the small street and install seats, including some to use for a coffee where the real estate company hopes to rent the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay bought the street was made public for the first time this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it does not necessarily mean that he wants to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renew this damaged villa and transform it into a public amenity," he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a representative of Accommodation Conservation, said that it was actually the city's desire to sell the street and made it clear that the agency's purpose was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to his most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left an impressive historical reading.
Some believe that he took the name in 1802, when a large agricultural company owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his many children and the strict strict landline was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the road may be better known as the set for the cover photo of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia."
"The land was wonderful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was an ammo, brandy of clothes and pieces of boots, posters, sheets, cords."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write "generification" of the East Village, are opposed to the idea of selling Extra Place, adding that the part of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rarity – a fragment of the city almost for no change that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subscribed, "The book of complaints: A little nostalgic to the city on the way out"), published part of a talk on the city's history that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is an unexplained empty corner, empty even of day and delimited doors of iron and windows with racinesches, with old days of weeks running along the bassifons."
With few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same one last night.
A rat ran aggressively across the back of the road near a door leading inside the CBGB, which is now the site of aristocratic clothing business.
On the walls there were graffiti and a bottle of beer empty from 22 hours close to a group of abandoned daily freshies.
A few of them said they rarely thought of Extra Place, but they suggested they needed to be a little dressed.
Mr Fields, for his part, said that he also thought that some people were underestimating the attraction of the road in his current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in black, dirty and unpleasant places."
The bilingual debate: immersion in English
At this point of Educational Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izimzi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior member of the California studies and senior director of the educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Because the middle class needs to choose a school."
Indeed attracting Spanish voters is a complicated matter.
The educational projects of Barack Obama are a significant example.
Mr Obama's campaign noted that "American and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," that is true.
To combat these deficiencies in achieving the objectives, Obama's educational plan specifically supports, among other things, "transitual bilingual education" for English students.
However, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which highlights teaching in different languages from English, does not take into account his interest in overcoming learning gaps.
Take, for example, Six Street Prep, an elementary school in the eastern county of Los Angeles.
School students are for the Spanish majority and low income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But, among the fourth students, a surprise 100 percent of the students did the above-level test in the 2008 math test.
Another amazing 93 percent of the fourth students have done an expert level test on art-di-language-English.
This incredible result has been achieved using a different ingredient from that preferred by Mr Obama.
Sixth Street highlights the review and exercise, constant assessment of competences and an attitude of the "no excuse" type.
In addition, and it is here that Mr Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of the Sixth Street, the school's hostile approach to English students is "full immersion."
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, said to me, "We had a fantastic success with a student just came from Mexico and if you had entered class 12 months later you would not be able to identify what it was".
"It works," he observed "for us."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep to replay it in other schools in most Spanish and with English students?
The results obtained from the school make the answer to that question very easy, but the educational policy in its own party (National Education Associations is a long-term supporter of bilingual education) and its continued support for bilingual education prevents Mr Obama from predicting the answer.
While he agreed that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the point when he said that people should stop worrying about "sole-English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "you must be sure that your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these gaps of achievement, he should consider carefully the educational models that work rather than hate them or ban them.
Petroleum freezes and renews economic fear
Petroleum prices have dropped sharply on Monday due to concerns that even the US saving plan for financial markets may not be able to raise the economy.
The future of the poor has fallen from 7 per cent to 99.80 dollars in the barrel at the New York stock exchange in the morning operations.
Prices have lost more than $20 in the barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the first materials markets have been removed from Wall Street's financial agitating, and from a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a little $145.26 at the bar in June, the prices were rounded up to nearly $90 at the bar at the beginning of this month, before resuscitating again on the basis of a tremendous uncertainty in the financial markets.
The anxiety affected investors on a new Monday even after the congressional leaders said they had reached an agreement at the end of the week about the rescue plan, the biggest of the history.
The news has been hidden from the fresh concerns that the financial crisis has been far from the past.
In the last episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will include the bank operations of Wachovia Corporation, said the government on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
The analysts of Barclays Capital said that the sudden negotiations last week had led to a rescue agreement " appear to have failed to revive the market's sense.
As the economic situation worsens, we expect the demand for raw materials, including oil, to cool down.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rates markets has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that the first materials will not be able to escape the contamination.
From a perspective of the materials first our most pressing concern is to the extent that the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China."
Banking analysts have reduced their expectations for the next year, while household oil consumption slows down economic growth, reducing oil and gas prices by around 20 per cent for 2009.
The operation in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone with the Jet uniform in the last eight and more seasons, defenseer Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he watched the performance of the second quarter of Sunday, when the Jets transformed a game without points into a summit.
"You see something like that," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Cardinals Arizona had equaled the grayer of the threatened clouds that would conquer them with a harmless game.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-year touchdown, providing the perfect signal for a afternoon in which their growing symphony took a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles for two other touchdowns in the room, including one when a cornerback has fallen and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first time.
"I didn't get out of my path," said Favre of all the trips to Cole.
He's a great player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people can think about."
While Favre and Cole were playing arrest games, the defense severely attacked the quarterback of Cardinals Kurt Warner.
The Cornerback Darrelle Revis has intercepted a waning launch and has launched it for 32 years in a touchdown.
Eric Smith's security has planned another move and intercepted him.
The linebacker David Bowens forces a Warner smoker.
The last turnover, the smoke forced by Bowens, could have been the most significant.
The Cardinals went advantage over the palle property, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had recovered the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely had a 20-year-old goal, for a 34- to 0 advantage.
It was more than the Jets ever signed in a room.
When he was asked to describe peace, the coach of the Jets Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When it was said to him both - the Jets gave 21 points without response in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I liked the second room much more than the third."
There were a lot of points in a small waste of time."
Gebrssellasie restated over his world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has shown again because many consider it the best marathon ever, breaking his same world record to the marathon in Berlin Sunday and becoming the first person to run a race of 26.2 miles under 2 and 4 minutes.
With a victory on the race favorablely piano at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie sent in franchise for 27 seconds his previous score of 2:03:26, last year in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselassie points to the world's 26th record of a career so poor that it has produced a global champion or a world record at every distance from the millimeter to the marathon.
The last month, Gebrselassie jumped off the Olympic marathon of Pechino, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, retrospectively - that air pollution would have increased its asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sundial and 48 degrees to departure, 55 degrees to arrival - Gebrselassie has won Sunday with an excellent average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Not only half-founders such as Gebrselassia and Paul Tergat del Kenya have gone to long distances, the marathon record has fallen more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo from Costa del Brazil came to Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told the reporters that two weeks ago she had cramps in her pockets and missed a week of training.
Of course, rest has left him fresh, not rotten.
"I'm so happy," said Gebrselasie to the reporter.
"It was all perfect.
I started a week ago, and I had doubts today, but at last everything went well."
It was a bit criticised - especially in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - for overarching its careers, generally avoiding many of the world's best marathon stars, counting on apripist as if it were a middle-class race, and putting world records on the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely reduce the size of Gebrselassie's competences as marathons.
With the step taken by four Kenyans Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the midway point at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite corridors, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, were held in the Gebrsellassie competition after the princes were changed.
A little over three thousand from the arrival, Gebrselassie made a final commitment to separate from Kwambai, which ended in 2:05:36, improving its best personal time for almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, native of Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen, has completed a significant year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh time is always the fastest.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record at 2:15:25.
The spring season, Mikitenko, 36 years old, was a surprise winner of London's Marathon at 2:24:14.
The game of Pechino has been lost with what is described as a serious incident, but it is cured to win in Berlin, making its best personal time for almost five minutes in the third marathon that has run.
She ran a race doing the calculations well, leaving a room of Ethiopian and Kenyan corridors to share with a great distance, taking them back some 18 miles and a half.
Askale Tafa Magrasa of Ethiopia arrived second at 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the park on an extensive theme on the subborgs of Orlando, a few miles away from the beautiful, from the noise, from the huge, quiet city where the pride and complications of the African-American experience enter into life.
Eatonville, the first black city incorporated into the country and the birth home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three fields of croquet, 300 brown skins, 300 good fans, plenty of guava, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect for Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
Yet in many ways, the city that he described - and which makes tourists stop to understand it in Florida's tourist guide produced by the Federal Writers' Project - remains a part of it.
It is as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often refused to share their thoughts with the white man, who "knowing so little of us, don't know what's going on."
Even now, in a year where a black president, Senator Barack Obama, has been called for an opening speech on race, many here remain dependent on the look of the outsider.
"We are very careful about how our history is told," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, a resident of all life and member of the oldest church in the city.
"He must be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is a historical model of black power and a community of almost 2,400 where the rate of poverty is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also an example of the shadow of the roots of the rural culture of the South Negro - sometimes dedegraded, sometimes prized - born by the American slave.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really began with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She showed the world to her birth city through sincere books, rich in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes We Watching God" (1937).
Five elements of Florida's leadership transformed the city, just outside the Route 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida within a black history scenario and human drama.
Low both in the life and in the literature, Hurston brought the readers to the store owned by the first union of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, to become more private.
"Out of the street to the left," he wrote, "it's the modern public school, it's brown with white refinances, with its well-loved gardens and courties, where Howard Miller was always bathing, thinking he could just read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of the Dash widow and wrote that Lee Glenn "sales drinks of all kinds and whatever fits in the passenger rooms".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston joined Eatonville with self-government but also with analfabetism, second nodes and sex.
Obviously this wasn't Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Now he said how it was," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's daughters who Hurston's dying calling men singing giant songs about their beauty.
Add, "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a living eccentric who often returned from his family to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, recalls that when Hurston was smoking in the city, he usually arrived without warning in a Chevrolt trionfant, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is also benefiting from decent clothing today.
Many residents were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others were suspicious.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But, he added, he poured himself on his seat on the back over the Sabelia lake, where Hurston was probably baptized, "they never stayed long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although he once was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 20s, he was buried in a room with no targe in Fort Pierce, Fla., where he lived.
In Eatonville, there was no big memorial ceremony, and no big conference.
"I don't think they understand their contribution to the world or their release to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a Houston biography published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-course highway through the city to clean up Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-course road.
The expansion of Orlando has already inspired Interstate 4 through the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period of his history.
The forced integration, in addition to other things, ended with the relative isolation of the Community.
In the 1950s, the fight on racial mesculence brought hatred on the door of the community's home.
"During that period a group of white boys would sell and get gold and stuff for people sitting on the side," said Mr. Franklin.
"In fact, we had a girl who was killed by that one time.
They got a cook from a car."
In a letter from 1955 to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made to the Supreme Court a request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown against the school office "an insult rather than an honor for my race".
The residents now say that the disintegration of schools, despite being positive under certain aspects, undermines Eatonville's cohesion and undermines the confidence of his young people.
"The black children used to be dressed - I remember this - you kissed your teacher in the morning, you kissed your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This is difficult, he added, until the teachers and students did not come from the same place.
"You didn't hug your white teacher because your white teacher... I mean, there's a cultural division there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, in any way, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - a black writer, actress and artist who overcame the prejudices, as he did, with happy security of himself and lines like: "How can some deny to themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just can't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long journey to the empty tomb of Hurston and began to fight for the resurrection of his reputation.
Five years later, a biography on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway attacked the library's caches, re-introducing it into the U.S. canon.
The project of the highway arrived right while his most famous daughter had re-worked the lights of the rebellion.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston saw her as a savior.
The community began to design a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans come to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many come back for the celebration.
Years later, I'll take him back from his project on the road.
"The five courses of the resurrected highway have brought what would be called the high speed, a real pride for the city," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd makes it easier to say, "Now save Eatonville."
The victory on the highway project helped change the image the city has.
Those from outside cities like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started to come to church in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville added to the public historical record in 1998.
A new library at a single piano (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a newly renovated and decorated Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly of Florida: only six miles from the centre of Orlando, can give the feeling of a secondary road under the summer rain, as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s of the 1800s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
The outsiders who come to search the history of Eatonville, for its meaning, are often treated with caution.
A permit requested in advance is required for most of the interview, in some things - such as the walls on the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man, who are seeing black men in the camps - have no permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a fat teacher, with a weakness for the bright red, still fear that their island community will become French.
However, not only did the Hurston festival expand, there was also a high level of civil pride.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville and Hurston with her entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, not better, neither worse nor worse, creative, great worker, shock and confusion like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is a sincere civil attachment to what can be heard in the voice of Mr Franklin, Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, who plans to return to Eatonville after the college to work in the local government or for the Department of Police, who said he might need help.
And the younger ones, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-olds from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Many people, if they just come in here, will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,' said Alondra Kenon after the show in a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at the story, it's really a grateful city."
Here in New York we all speak fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the newspaper’s bankers and the huge TV screens of Times Square, they would not be inclined to be in the eye of the cycle.
They would never deny that the glass offices, at the bottom of their heads, the banks and the heads of hedge funds that monopolize New York, live the worst "hard day in office" every day since the end of 1929.
The factors remove metal wheels for the road through the marciapies, transporting muffin bags for breakfast meetings.
Latin-Americans cross the steps between condoms carrying, like human mollusks, 50 and rolled shirts attached to a baton on their back.
Employees are still waiting in line for their morning luggage on the food carts, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between the 16th and the 19th of a working day.
It did not seem that there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of shame and sadness, I decided to open a new book of salvation on Thursday afternoon.
Even if I had planned the event so that it would coincide with the late afternoon break to my JP Morgan Chase branch, a piece of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the casino sports hall, to withdraw money or deposit it, but in front of the customer service sports hall, where old customers order subscriptions, tourists ask for directions for the big Macy store and new customers open accounts.
Many of those who are in front of me, I would then learn from Starr, my "trust banker," were in line for my own reasons.
On the contrary, however, they have already taken the savings from the smaller banks from the places where the prisoners do, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They have taken the money from the so-called trophyts (a little like a construction company), credit cooperatives and types of civil savings banks whose branches operate only within a state, and claim to treat customers as family.
In the past years, 15 of these banks have failed.
In recent days Washington Mutual, a bank with 327 billion dollars in assets, has been submitted to the controlled administration, and while the New Yorkese were heading home for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of 440 billion dollars, was searching for a buyer who saved it.
The employees and the merchants who were facing me, who were unaware of another gang, were putting their money at a bank that was perceived as a safe port, the bank that's asking for more penalties at Wall Street.
The common New Yorkeses in the past few weeks have become competent in financial terms.
A woman to my Chinese supermarket of trust, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank went bankrupt, and her beloved Director General Dick Full in all familiarity, as if lying to a bad colleague.
And Lynn, the uniform portina, almost fifty of my condom, has changed the subject according to our normal subject of conversation on Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my expenses.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!
I've changed, I'm not running any risk."
The Muslim tombed while Austria turned to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left of the Austrian right Party of Freedom and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right party of Vladimir Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the "City Against Islamization" organization in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They bring signs of type to those street representatives of Moscow with a red line that passes through the middle.
The police blamed the right-wing extremists for profaning a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that the political parties of the right-wing party have won a lot to the national general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at Traun's cemetery, near Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what the police thought was an organized action.
The criminals have followed with the sprayy Hebrew symbols such as the David's Star over some graves, but detectives believe it could be an attempt to mask the extreme motives led by an hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is related in some way to the elections.
A spokesman from the local Islamic community said that they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the profanation, which took place at the end of Ramadan, months of religious significance for Muslims.
Austria, at the time, was on a spiritual search trip following its turn to the right in the parliamentary elections yesterday.
The two parties on the right that have taken almost 30 percent of the votes, the Austrian freedom party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, have campaigned with often anti-immigrant tickets and some of their slogans have been defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, head of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, has campaigned against the streets and the burkas and has also expressed his opposition to food that is perceived as connected to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European fraternity" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to flag the construction of museums and mines, leading to political symbols of a continuing Islamicization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses take place immediately after the elections, which have established the extreme right as the strongest political block of the nation, indicating that the change was brought to the top by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel abroad forbidden to Gary Glitter.
At Gary Glitter, the glamour star of sexual abuse on children, was forbidden to travel to France and Spain by court.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he had informed the authorities that they wanted to go to Spain through France.
The ban on travel abroad was granted to Kent's police last Thursday after he gave the judges the evidence of previous Glitter's arrests for sexual abuse of minors.
Glitter, a true name for Paul Gadi, was not present at Ashford's hearing in Kent but was represented by the attorneys of Corker Binging.
A spokesman from the Court Service said: "On Thursday 25 September at Ashford's prefecture, Kent's police filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's exit from travelling to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64 years old, had informed the authorities of the intention to travel abroad as required by the registration of convicted persons for sexual harassment.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also asked to give the police a warning of seven days on his scheduled departure date.
The lack of notification to the authority may lead to a sentence of five years of imprisonment.
Kent's police said they didn't want to discuss individual cases or possible Glitter movements in the country.
A Kent police officer said: "Kent's police will do everything they can to protect children in this country or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to control someone who remains in the United Kingdom because we have sufficient complete systems to manage any potential risk more effectively.
"Protecting Kent's residents is the main concern of Kent's police and we will work closely to monitor the conduct of convicted persons for sexual offences registered in the country in order to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom the last month after he spent 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two 10 and 11-year-olds.
When Glitter came he flew to Bangkok where he had to sail on a flight to London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not have made it through passport checks and finally took a flight to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also did not allow him to enter and return to Bangkok where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow's 3rd terminal on August 22, and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge, west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully made a request for an order to enter him in the register of convicted for sexual assaults.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the United Kingdom in 1999 for having had images of child abuse.
A source of the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Secretary of the Interior, felt secure and happy that Glitter had been stopped by traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the teacher away from the scene to alienate the character" Günther Bauer, photographer
Don't touch, don't fly, don't get used to it.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, mirrored by the concentration that characterizes interpretation, to look at the release of man or woman.
Part of the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable facts, except in private, at those moments away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they must not go into scene.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alters the theatre of some scaffolds to singers, dancers and guitarists on the stage with the least known side of these masters.
To this end, the photograph offers an original iconography of the flamenco, bounding it from various visual angles.
The exhibition, including in the programming of the Month of the Flamenco Photography, reflects the international importance of this ball, every day ever more," explains the artist and explains that in "Flamenco-People" it could also be common people, but seeing the pictures, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, interpreters or performers on the scene.
These people pictures of "the street" are "artists able to convey passion, sadness, joy when they're in scene ... and catch the public.
In order to capture the personality of these great ones, it is not necessary to draw them in a scene,
Because their personality and character are inside.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera the personality of the huge flamenco."
With passion for the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer started a long journey towards dancing singers, guitarists or dancers using a camera on the side.
They are pictures that, due to the type of machinery and materials, they remember classical photography.
The application of various stylist techniques violates the traditional principles of the image, referring to the modernity photo, according to an idea reflecting the design of Bauer's own flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not dancing, singing or singing in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, is capable of winning the audience with his art.
The search for a meeting with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way to feel and be, are and have been the constant of this work, in these days at the El Fotomata gallery.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are in this selection of about seventy artists taken.
The project has become a sort of anthology of flamenco, and will soon be published in a book that will gather the pictures displayed on the occasion of the exhibition.
The passion for pictures brought Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "SportARTproject".
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I admire people, know them and can penetrate them for a moment in their lives, whether this is a long or short moment.
I think the picture is the most difficult type in photography.
You meet or face people, characters that sometimes don't even know or that give you just a few minutes to take the picture out.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to concrete my ideas."
The collection of photos of the contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is located at the El Fotomata gallery, on the 20th of the way of the Mata, parallel to the way of Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until the next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa realizes that the novel he's writing is a "zzardo"
It is environmentalized in places where it is not yet known and deals with unknown issues: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is in detention with a new project to which he is working, a novelist whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived in Congo for twenty years and has passed through the Amazon.
Since always in favor of the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday on the occasion of the Hay Festival of Segovia, that the project you are currently dealing with "is an azard" and that "all indicates you shouldn't write it."
"If I had a good sense, I wouldn't write it, but I'll do it the same way and hope to finish it as soon as possible," he concluded his intervention at the festival for exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he saw a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people passing through the city of Aqedot.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as predicted, the figure for the third edition of the speech festival.
Vargas Llosa, who won the award of Hay Festival to be the most voted writer – an ancient edition of the book "Our mutual friend" of Dickens, filled the places of the theatre Juan Bravo.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of a public to whom he fled the time when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of amorism, called out as he was born in his literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "reader" and "to live beyond what I live"; as he writes in "disciplined mode" to supplement the "inspired" with an intense work of documentation, editing and continuous recovery; as Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas have influenced his vocation and as "the images of the memory" are the basis on which his accounts are based.
The Spanish-American novelist, he acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an efficient experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, arguing that, on the contrary, "has effects" and "makes the most anti-conformist people." Therefore he invited the writers to "do not give up" and "take responsibility" for their vocation.
Time stops the Pozoblanco Festival, taking it to the corridors.
The celebration of the corridors that should have suggested the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday, after the towers selected for the corridors had verified that the conditions on the floor of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in accordance with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The summers were against this Festival and prevented it from celebrating for two days on three days.
Saturday, the plague prevented the execution of the second race of towers.
They represented Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Baptista, who were supposed to face a bull of Castilblance.
Therefore, the Festival had to be held on Friday only.
On this occasion Daniel Luque was to trionyphare, cutting three ears and being brought out into trionypho, after he had torturing with pleasure and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante brought to a close his two races, risking health and hearing, more than the public, than for the race itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing from the arena of Los Llanos without honor and no punishment.
With the second bull, after a horrendous mob, the fish were won by most of the public.
A car with two thousand kilos of hashish over the block site in Alava
Five less than ten in the morning.
The agents close the height to the two employees of a vehicle that instead of stopping, they run away.
The agents feared the high level of two drivers of a vehicle that, instead of stopping, had fled.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
After following them, the agents are able to arrest one of the two employees, a man of about 28 years of age, identified as A.A.J., as reported in the report of the Department of Internal Affairs of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual is accused of drug trafficking and falsification of public documents.
The incident was verified when some of Alava road officials were conducting a transport control on N-1, at which point through the municipal circuit of Arminüón.
They were about to stop a vehicle for inspection when the driver, crossing orders, hurriedly speeded up and crossed the block.
The agents were in pursuit until the vehicle, after a couple of miles, stopped on the side of the road and its two crews fled to a forest area.
The Ertzaintza agents were therefore able to arrest one of the fugitives and to trace the 2,178 kilograms of hashish that they carried and had once inspected the van, an Iveco Daily.
The hasshish panels, which were located in the rear of the vehicle, were subsequently put under police surveillance for a thorough investigation and detection of the weight.
In addition, since the officials found that the matrix was "doubled" because it did not match that reported in the vehicle documentation, the ban was also imposed on the falsification of public documents.
Ertzaintza is continuing the investigations to arrest the second suspect, who has been able to escape as already mentioned, and to determine the origin of the sequencated drug.
A. A. J., 28 years old, was led to the police station to carry out appropriate procedures and to be available to the judge in the next hours.
Arrested actress Heather Locklear for guidance under the effect of drugs
The actress Heather Locklaar, the Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for guidance under the effect of drugs.
A witness saw him perform dangerous maneuvers while trying to get out with the car from the parking lot in Montecito, as revealed in the People magazine by a truck driver from the California street.
The witness specified that around 16.30 the Locklear "the accelerator ran deep, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the parking lot with rough manoeuvres ahead and back. Making a retreat, he passed again before his eyes from the sun."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first apparently did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear was stopped on a nearby road and was out of the vehicle.
It was this person who warned the emergency services because "he was concerned about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actress sitting inside his vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"It seemed confused," and for this reason the agents have led it to a specialist centre for drug and alcohol use to submit it to a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress has shown himself collaboratively and the hypotheses of alcohol abuse have been eliminated since the beginning, although "as observed by the officials at first, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some drug."
The Locklear was arrested with the suspected guide under the effect of some non-specific substance and was locked in the local prison about 19 p.m., to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, the Locklear was restored by a specialist clinic in Arizona after being recovered following an episode of anxiety and depression.
Callazares calls for the long-term IU Federation to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The UI's general coordinator and member of the Unit Party, Gaspar Llamazares, has confirmed today that he will expect the regional Federation of Training to decide on the case of the former advisor to the City of Sivilla, Francisco Manuel Silva, who appointed the resignations the last week following the claim of customerism.
"In these cases, they are particularly federalists, and it will be the long-term organisation to assume their responsibilities," Llamazares said regarding the resolution that the party should adopt against what has so far been a consultant in the civil council.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities that Silva would have committed. "The UI has always wanted this type of investigation to be the maximum transparency."
Similarly, he stressed that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public duties."
"Sangre de May", the Episcopal Scourge of Garci
Inspired by the Episodios Nationales of Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci recommends the famous Spanish revolt against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his film, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the director tried to "show the stream of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous romance, explained today during the presentation of the film, with Kim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría as head of a wide range of interpretations.
Sangre de May, for more than two and a half hours, started this Friday in cinema halls, to become a television minister over four hours in the future on TeleMadrid.
The great admirer of Galdós' literature, Jose Luis Garci, maintains that he has done this "a dream of his childhood", and believes that he should be grateful to Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Madrid Community had commissioned him three years before he was filmed a memorial film for the second century of May 2nd. The director agreed that the story was based on the novel Episodios Nationales.
The 15 million budgets allocated throughout the Madrid Community have represented Garci as a "one-off opportunity" for Garci to enjoy the proper scenarios and customs to draw a "a strodish Spain that failed to choose the leader for which to fight and the fact that the struggle for independence brought the people a huge delay in development under the reign of Ferdinand VII" observed Garci.
However, the director failed to receive funding like those of Alatriste or Los Fantamas de Goya - more than twice as much as Sangre de Mayo, so it was not possible to turn some scenes planned by the script that he himself signed with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost all his career.
This, for the Register of Return to begin, influenced what is its usual work practice, the stage with the actors, with which it is often used to try before turning with those who will not be part of the castle, because it is considered to be "submissible," considering that "part of the work of the register lies in the theatre and cinema to know what is happening in the sector in which it works."
Many of the interpreters, some of whom come back to the Sangre de May castle, try in front of their car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidateed to Oscar for four times - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films candidates to represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy - his Blood de Mayo, Seven Months of billar francés and, the last select Los grioles blinds -, they do not represent the youngest generation of the Spanish cinema "which should rather be known."
From this film Garci does not expect prizes.
"At first you think you're working for the posters, then you realize that you're only working for prosperity, and at some point you're just going to turn a movie into more," explains Garci after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon finds out the civil essence of the ballerina Tortola Valencia
A Civil Ballerina makes tribute to another ballerina just like Siviglia.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, a Catalan father (Firenze Tortola Ferrer) and an Andalusa mother (Georgia Valencia Valencia Valencia), was born in the village of Triana, and at the age of three he moved with the family in London.
It was a ballerina of free dance and a specialist in Oriental dances.
He led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of the female embezzlement, of the caliber of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who protested a revolution in the context of dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always highlighted Isabel Bayon.
"I'd love to work with Pepa Gamboa and you'd propose this character to me.
The ballerina continues: "We do not intend to tell his whole life, but to gather the spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested some basic elements of the flamenco.
So, "the dance of the maripos" has suggested to me a gajira, or "the dance of the snake" some tanhi.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my way back into this aesthetic," he explains.
The scene includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing again Isabel in one of his shows, as he does in "The Open Door"; and that of Master Matilda Coral, who had an exceptional desire to work with what was his ally.
"Matilde interprets Tortola from adults, the character of maturity.
I'm happy that you agreed to work in my work and I feel very honored about this."
The amplification also includes the composition of musical and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi di Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who interprets the role of the eternal companion of these artists who have been all the time, and that they have always had a lot of fun."
The work is also in some ways the life of this woman who lives far away, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then the whole of Europe, because, usually, she lived in London.
"I wanted to remember it, because I think it's one of the women who had a huge influence in a historical period and now no one remembers it and so much less considers his operation as something valuable," says Bayon.
The show will begin today at 20.30 p.m. at Lope de Vega's theater.
With the publication of the "Diario de en poeta recién married" the Trinity is also closed
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de en Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities programmed by the Council for the Culture of the Andalusia Youth to celebrate the "Thirennio di Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of both.
Thus, the "Thirennio di Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concludes with the revision of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel museum, and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That cup de luz", which was opened last May and that, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, it is expected to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
In addition, the Assembly of Culture of the Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de en Poeta Reciencasado", by Peter Taberero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and the work of one of the most valuable Andalusian poets.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of these."
The phrase is from the actor Sally Field, who I worked with him in "Ausencia de Malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all America, in front of the unconquerable idea that Newman had left.
Yet it cost him a lot to get him an Oscar.
And since 2007, he's been retired.
And he also knew he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what a test goes beyond any expression, and now I lost a big friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country could have been better thanks to his existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
He died a father of cinema and patriots at a particularly dark moment, because of the fear of terrorists and markets, with the self-esteem of the American people on earth, in search of new motivations to feel worthy.
When the times are so difficult, men are so rude and are very good people to admire, it does not need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he was incarnate the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and advocate of lost and twenty causes, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honour of the premature death of overdoses to the creation of the petaling and biological food brand.
All gifts to a country where it is very expensive to go beyond a dead food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without healing or nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that a man hasn't died, it's over for a while.
Another Englishman, Sam Mendes, a prime minister with Oscar, said working with Newman was nothing less than the ambition of his career.
The little boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, was determined to define Paul Newman's greatest inspiration.
"He left a high-level example for all of us," observes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today tries to live as Paul Newman did: keeping high regard for the need for justice and having a serious and far-reaching private life in the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
However, some have tried us and Paul Newman is a good example for us.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, who remained faithful to him without necessarily missing the opportunities for not being.
"Why am I going to eat out of hamburger today, if I have a drink at home?" he cried out.
In heaven he is accompanied by the pride that his daughters on earth are also his miracles, which is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles that he interpreted, of no one was as proud as that of a devoted husband, a loving father, not discouraged and passionate philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect course of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that before or after the Olympics arrive in Madrid and, after the 2012 attempt failed, this could happen in 2016.
But I'm asking, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's course, you'll just say no!
They called him "the perfect race", but I think the worst thing I've ever seen was the worst.
A lot of shocks, which if they were then taken into account in the assessment act and I had to examine them, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But we're going in order and starting from the beginning.
The shocks began with the removal of the dorsal, which assumed to be first.
It didn't seem a wrong idea, but if you have to go, it's to withdraw everything (including chips to avoid codes during the race).
Not at all.
You had to go only to take the dorsal (first shock, only to go for this) and (after the relevant code), surprise! they had magliet only 'S' size (second shock, because I need an XL size).
What world do we live in?
Is it a crime of the crisis if they have decided to buy only small miglites, made with less fabric and thus less expensive?
Well, things like this are wrong with the same day of the race.
In addition to having to go very soon to take the chip, the waiting code was 15 minutes and for more, you had to deposit the sink.
The waiting is longer than 35 minutes, which is impossible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as it was predictable, the course was started that we had not even deposited the roof, although, once successful in the company, recovery was even worse.
In addition, the plague threatened the waiting for more than 40 minutes, with attempts of popular rebellion and forced to stand.
At least 500 people will certainly have pneumonia tomorrow, and some, like me, will not even be in the correct classification due to the chip that, I guess, did not correctly record the arrival.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect course, this will certainly not enter my mind.
So I think we'll keep dreaming a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft search for receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft presented in advance a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, capable of carrying out some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case described by Microsoft, a navigation service to be located inside the company's campus) helping the phone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and times, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people there are in a room, who are - including to remember their position in the company - and to listen and understand the key words in a conversation with them.
It can also group the participants in the conversation groups.
In the video for example, the receptionist finds a third person, but he realizes that he does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not a company employee.
He asks if he's there to visit someone and says he'll be available soon.
All without blue screen.
It's amazing.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked a lot about a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has found that if computers were equipped with essential and less commercial space functions, they should be five times faster – hey! Steve will be for "the less".
All a discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows functionality and "extra".
The change in direction is welcome.
Microsoft has reason: the operating system is becoming increasingly important, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome on the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that Google was the first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not a operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for hardware and software to communicate.
Do the same thing with your wife or your husband when you have something to say to the nurse.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think about the "death" of the operating system, not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People always pay less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
The computer is only taken to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome - and daily we spend more time browsing in the network than in a window-based environment.
What do half of the operating system applications serve?
It's more than that.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is interested more in integrating its online services to create a valid alternative to Google.
They have a desperate need, in fact, and I have a little example here.
I took the photo in this place in one of the resorts for Microsoft employees, in Redmond, at the beginning of this month.
On the drink machine, a folder asks them to use their own research tool - "Your research. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to do network research.
Last week, the delay in the development of the new Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be placed on the market in the first months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if it is not allocated in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The cell phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is painful.
La Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried it in the cost of Azzurra, Leonardo di Caprio reflected in Edward Zwick's Diamante de blood, as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'Padrino' in addition to being part of the typical uniform of the gay Muslim parish.
And if we try to enumerate the appearances of stars, we can repeat the image of the force with the target buffs that raise the weights in the ambulatory circle.
It is, in substance, of the typical man-made migliette, with the inside of cotton, atylated and handy.
It's the 'tank', as the Anglophones call it, although, Belgian Fabuleux Marcel above all.
The "Marcel" is excellent for others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive voice and for the small Belgian flag (only recognizeable), which the most emblematic models of the migliette carry as detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" is excellent for others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive voice and for the small Belgian flag (only recognizeable), which the most emblematic dairy models carry as detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian ditt is not only about the famous "tank".
Includes flags for college, retro boxer, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, seamstresses, baby-dolls, mini short...
Close drinks thought to be comfortable.
And it's a sin to use them as intimate whites.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't care."
The great harmony with the sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters have taken their new activity seriously in the fashion field.
For Monica, I'm much more than beautiful girls and celebrity who give their own name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the Mango company made of its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important prizes than the Spanish fashion house sponsorship.
Hot and scared, you're quick to win.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to introduce the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have thought about for Mango's summer season, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of Mango Fashion Awards and the Opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
Let's say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
From what elements does your new collection for Mango take place in this fourth working season for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the 50s and 60s movie, we got a lot of inspiration from here.
Then I love to lose myself in the city and watch how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes. I do so often.
Ballerina, actress and stylist, you're a very brave woman, aren't you?
I think yes, even though at the end, everything is confusing and there are many elements in common.
From childhood, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to feed my aunt's arms and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the game park.
Then, once in a while, I've always paid a lot of attention to dress.
You know, balloons love to have their own style to go to school and to know, to look at the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of attraction, when they deliver you the guard is the moment you really meet the character.
So everything goes together, yes, with great respect for the stylists and professionals.
Not long ago, you worked 30 years, you got into a crisis?
But no.
I never felt better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to gain life by making less mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't bother me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was young and this has given me much inner happiness.
So you think you're gonna be a mother, right?
Of course, I know that I will be a mother because my own body asks me and I want to be a young mother, that I don't want to lose.
As for the candidate, I don't care too much.
What I will do will give my son much happiness and educate him with love.
As for the cinema, you are waiting to be seen in the different rooms some filmed last year.
That's right, and I really want them to be.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I'm very patient and worried, I want everything right now and clearly, but it can't always be that way.
I want it to be "The Last Time" and "In Search of the tomb of Christ."
We'll see if you like it.
A few days ago you started on the walker with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not that I was in the passport as a model.
Just Naomi Campbell, who has known me for a long time, has called me to go to London to participate in a charity for his organization "Done for a better world" and the clothes that we have shown – I have brought two parts of our collection for Mango – have been put to the station to collect funds for this Naomi's NGO.
People don't know this side of Naomi's back.
They say so many things about you, that I know for a long time I can assure you that I'm not that true.
In addition, I find this good part in which you are involved.
He asked me to jump for a noble cause, but if he asked me to do the pen, I would do the same.
If it's to help women in the third world, you can't get back.
Recycling alcoholic drivers will have to install the "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that drivers with three administrative sanctions for excess alcohol rates in the blood to install in their car the system that prevents driving the vehicle in a state of emergency or if it does not comply with the device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the General Prosecutor-General of State, which will be a pilot project for a year.
The purpose of this project is to reintegrate the driver, since this should take a rehabilitation course on the road.
In addition to the Road Safety Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Automobile Safety Institute (FITSA) will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of car drivers reported more than once for driving in emergency mode then drive the car back.
Alkolock would avoid it, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the inspired air and prevents driving the car if the driver does not support it, or when a higher alcohol concentration is detected than that allowed.
The cost is above EUR 1000 and would be liable to the penalty.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that the vehicles of these devices are able to reduce to 65% of the offences committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the life of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to be strict with these behaviours before criminal offences occur.
And in order to facilitate their development, since the legal reform can be carried out normally, and undoubtedly the necessary reform for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in some commercial solutions, although it has already been introduced experimentally in some industrial and public vehicles.
In the morning, the Congress of Members will vote on an initiative by the PSOE which proposes to install this system in schools' buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 17.40, the second programme, the Spanish plane traveling the principles of Asturias landed in the presidential garage at the airport Benito Juárez in Mexico City.
The sun was moving, but the rats still insisted on using their hands as they would see the real couple drop off the plane.
At the feet of the scale, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
Some time ago I asked a taxi driver, for the road, if he knew that the Spanish principles were to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that time ... You're here or...
No, sir, she's Spanish, but she's been here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very good...
The Mexican press, however, knows very well who are the principles of Asturias and the importance of travel.
There are many waiting in the airport's garage on the red carpet and military cordon consisting of 27 marine soldiers who offer the salute.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in blue sea, and she, the princess, calls to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps they have referred to them as a serious threat to Mexico City.
They give the photographers a smile and a brief pause before passing into the room where the official committee awaits them.
At the hotel door where they live, one of the four largest cities, awaits them as a spiritual reporter of Mexican television.
The best award offered by fashion
There is probably no place in the most suitable world to present a fashion award, which is not Paris and there is probably no smarter and good living styleist in Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to promote international promotion of new talent in the fashion field.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his designs in Mango wine at the 54th Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost flattened from emotion.
In addition, it is the second wholesale trade in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square metres of extension.
The first is in London.
The many events, combined with the desire to please the Valentino stylist who was the leader of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of Chagal's most skirmished TV, the presidential table of gala prepared by Mango, it was even more spectacular.
Born in the heart of the infrared and in need of virtue, due to the recent death of the brother, she wore a house dress and some ELAH supplements to remove the wound and arm of Luis's son - a boy of almost two meters high - accompanied Valentino to the presidential table.
Andik, owner and master of Mango, made the house and horses that he finished, together with Barone Rotchil, without a jacket, because they had both brought them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who managed the store in pants and shirts – designed by her hand – turned into a dinner, dressed in a long, very sexy black dress and excited during the evening walk accompanied by Goya Toledo in the work, when they showed us the room for ballet shoes and her, remembering other times, she picked up a bar and wrapped up a "great floor".
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the places of the palace, but he showed us pictures of his son on the cell.
The next day we got excited about the presence of Olivier Martinez – another boy who moved into the motorcycle - and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his lenzuola, his clothes and be assured in advance, that we were not ashamed of him in his room.
Stars under the star sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, anti-stress number
There are no 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the caotic and frenetic daily life.
And as if that wasn't enough, they're all gathered in a book that will bring the rest in the books on September 30th.
The wake is almost a punishment when it climbs every morning at 7:00 a.m., but it is even worse to imagine being involved in the sudden rhythm of modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer's bad skin.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
There are, however, not one or two ways to fight daily harassment and the fact that we are getting out of the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massage or "spa", Susannah Marriottt collects in the pages of his book, all a "menu" of options for each one's taste and time.
The anti-stress operation is entitled "1001 ways to relax" and its peace will reach the libraries thanks to editor Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone thinks that it is impossible to win peace in areas such as the work force or in personal relationships, this "manual" makes this conviction false.
It also suggests alternative solutions, such as contacting nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If the adrenaline is no longer running in your veins to find the balance of the body and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, reflect the mind and focus on reading.
Speak in the dream
Some kids talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very anxious to tell us something that happened to them the previous day, but to those children who talk about being asleep.
The first time it happens, at least one jumps, but it doesn't really matter much.
This is a benign change of the dream-defined dream.
It occurs with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, most of you have told me that you spoke in the dream.
This phenomenon can be very sporadic (one time in life, for example, associated with a high fever episode) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month...), the day after the child doesn't remember anything anymore.
There is no single reason to explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes there are episodes associated with other sleep disorders such as incubation, night anxiety, night sweats (to make the nap in bed), or sleepbulism, but not necessarily so.
As mentioned earlier, it can be associated with very high fever rates, stress situations or overcrowding.
In any case, it's a phenomenon that's not yet studied.
Also the intensity with which it appears is extremely variable.
It can happen that the person speaks with a tone of voice very calm, with words of silence, almost in a surrogate or that the opposite occurs (wolves, cry, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be appropriate to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to check whether there are some issues that are causing an abnormal state of anxiety as a result of the situation.
We have said that this is a benign alteration, so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if combined with insomnia or stress situation).
What can be done, however, is taking into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to exaggerate the child before he goes to bed.
Offer peaceful games and avoid programs or TV series that cause fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is fatal to relax, you can use relief techniques to help them acquire some inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep more calmly.
Once the sounds appear, try to keep the silence.
Remember that I am harmless to the child and that the day after that will not remember anything about what happened.
Practical advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because it's not aware of what's happening, and you interrupted the dream.
Although she's talking, she's sleeping and so she's resting.
Remember that if you appear very anxious and episodes have a certain frequency, it is better to consult a doctor or check out where such a concern is caused in the child.
If you understand what it says (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to make a questionnaire to get information.
You won't get anything, because he's asleep and so he doesn't know how to organize his mind.
In addition, you are able to hear what he says but not to see what he is dreaming about, so you need to pay much attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions they might bring.
Don't ever tell the child you can ask him questions during the night to get to know his secrets.
At least for a joke.
One thing of the kind is causing enormous anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that lasts just a few minutes.
Illausern... finally
The Illhaeusern finally found the road to home victory after a long infuriated period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Giallo-neri have created the largest number of network opportunities transforming one into the win of the game.
The rhythm was not very sustained during this encounter in which attackers were expressed in fact.
After a first attempt by the captain of the Kauffmann host team who shot the seventh with a remote shot, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other caused the defense of Dannemarie, Funderflick away, then Hirn high, Romain of point and yet Diebold.
Dannemarie responded with a block in the center of the camp, leaving only the escape Rihai at the point of attack.
The beginning of the second time was decisive with two initial occasions signed by Riai and Temporal for Dannemarie, and immediately after the first network of Marais for the Illhaeusern, well-placed, took a stand against a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the cannon of the Illhaeusern will not be able to achieve its long-term happiness and will be released a dozen minutes after leaving his teammates with a numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to use it and will not cause great problems to the Illhaeusern's Undicies, which is simply designed to "strengthen" the defense, except in the last minutes of the game when, after a rocambolic action, the ball broke through.
Sarkozy meets the fishermen in the collery
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will stop in Britain.
Prior to demonstrating the fishermen who had violently banned access to various Breton ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to return to the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finistère, to appeal to the representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him "with a constructive spirit" and hope that he would "be present with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit, which takes place at the same time as the general meeting of the "crisis committee", created by Breton fishermen in order to take measures to deal with the commitment to the gas price, has reached its record with an average of more than €1.14 per litre.
According to Elisio David Martinin's spokesman, the president "will discuss with them possible solutions to help businesses regain competitiveness and make sure the working conditions and pay for marines".
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stop.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted the "light operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of ngorghi.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections with Belle-ële were not interrupted.
A road block has been carried out on the Quiberon Peninsula.
On Monday, the sailors had already demonstrated their determination by burning, from the white, pneumatics and pallets in front of the fuel warehouses at the gates of Brest and Lorient, while they were holding demonstrations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement has extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and Manica, such as Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the fishing is left at the well, or at Havre, where a fleet of vessels prevented the movement of ships from trading.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, near Loira Atlantica, interrupted the block of the total refinery note by Donges in the evening.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday to decide any action.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support the movement.
"I will continue to shoot him" because "fishers will not surrender" and "does not intend to stay in Paris," he announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, president of the Committee of Fisheries of Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay gas taxes, are currently about 50 cents per litre, but they believe that the limit of the performance of a loading is only reached with a gas of less than EUR 0,30 per litre.
Paul Newman the great
The unforgettable interpretation of "Butch Cassidy" is a cancer death at the age of 83 in his Connecticut house.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and yet Sam Mendes have saluted the legend of the movie and actor Paul Newman, who was 83 years old.
Embraer maintains the delivery forecasts in 2008
This year 215 is the result of the aircraft construction company, despite the threats of recession that are recorded on the world economy.
Embraer, fourth world company in the sector, maintains the delivery forecasts for 2008 with the delivery of 215 airports, confirmed his president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first month, he delivered 97 planes.
The Brazilian company is widely trusted in the Chinese market, particularly for the range air between 30 and 120 locations.
To date, Embraer delivered in eight years 41 airports to Chinese customers.
AIG would give more than 15% of its activities
The U.S. International Group insurance company, released on foot by the U.S. monetary authorities, would give more than 15% of its activities in order to repay the loan of $85 billion, according to the Financial Times Sunday edition.
The AIG is ready to consider the sale of most of its activities, in addition to the transfer of life insurance frameworks to the international market and to the United States, needs the newspaper on the basis of sources more than volunteers.
The Board of Directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to review any delays, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained at the AIG.
The activities that the AIG intends to grant include the International Lease Financial Corp airline, its share of 59% of Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the FT.
No final decision has been taken on these concessions, the FT continues.
The AIG must recover rapidly in order to repay the loan of 85 billion grants from the Federal Reserve, in order to see the US authorities pay 80% of its capital.
Paris: history Morning Meeting
New York's Borsa accused a historic earthquake on Monday, after the Chamber of Representatives expressed itself against Paulson's plan for the rescue of financial institutions: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, i.e. a fall, approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) is completed at 10,365.45 points below 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst losses in its history (684.81 points) above that of 17 September 2001 on the day of the reopening of the Borse following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
Nasdaq, the main technological title index, lost 199.61 points closing at 1.983.73 and the extended standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8,81% (or 106.85 points) closing at 1,106.55, with final closing figures.
Demoralized at first sitting, Wall Street is shattered after the unexpected rejection of the bank rescue plan, designed to bring stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 votes in favour, the representatives rejected the funding requested by Treasury Minister Henry Paulson.
About two Republicans on three have rejected the plan.
"It's a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
"All of this indicates how much the market accounts for the project," he added, fearing that within a few days it could be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project was actually murdering... then the witness would quickly pass on to the Fed – Federal Reserve- (the Central Bank, etc.) and to other central banks to resolve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, the financial and economic manager at Global Insight.
And highlighting the state of emergency, "every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, he stressed the Piegza.
After the fall of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia’s banking activities by the city group.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated rapidly, calling for emergency intervention in favour of the banks of the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, indicating that markets "not only face an American crisis but a global crisis" has added FTN's analyst.
The compulsory market has gone very far.
The income of the Treasurer's Booni at 10 years is reduced to 3,632%, against 3,827% on Friday evening, while that at 30 years is 4,161%, against 4,357% on the previous day.
Obama in favor of the first TV couple
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates at the White House, it is the second to find out who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Without any surprise, the general districts of the Republican and democratic campaign have declared the respective victory of the TV dual, followed by a third of the American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although worthy, has not been brilliant enough to allow him to slow down in the polls for five weeks from the presidentials.
The Gallup Institute, of which a published opinion survey on Saturday provides a five-point advantage in Obama (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows that democracy had the best.
An instant survey conducted by CbsNews on an independent sample of voters found that 39% of them considered Obama the winner, while 25% points to McCain.
A great performance by his listmate Joe Biden, waiting during the first and only debate with the rival Sarah Palin, should confirm Obama's advantage on Thursday.
"Assessing it would be a mistake.
It has a good idea," however, warned Bill Clinton this week-end.
Senator McCain has never failed to promote his inconsistencies in foreign policy, stressing the "ingenuity" of the adversary with regard to the arguments encountered during the first face.
"Senior Obama doesn't seem to understand what..." he often said many times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and skills necessary to become president," he said.
What has been a constant debate for the Republican TV campaign since yesterday.
Obama, by his song, stressed how his election would represent a new future.
Without delay, it has been shown to be concious and precise.
It has promoted its pre-position to the right decisions and its intention to restore the image of the United States on the world scene.
"McCain has never understood, unlike Obama," he said, this weekend, a democratic spot, telling the Republican that he has not taken the necessary measures to deal with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the nine minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, he accused Obama yesterday, before 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under a beating mourning, for an election meeting.
He has not even uttered the words "mediate class" or "laborators". The financial crisis is in favour of Obama, considered by the Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy at the top of the precipice.
"The next week may represent a decisive turn," he considered yesterday the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer.
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's economic perspective to that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current round "is the final green after eight years of hard economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reiterating the intention of reducing taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street's support, the Illinois Senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of any country's energy independence thanks to the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, by his side, would build a park of 45 nuclear centers by 2030.
The two candidates were cautiously hiding the applications focused on the financial rescue plan of $700 billion (470 billion) adopted yesterday at the Congress and extremely low.
In Minsk, "Have you noticed that there were elections?"
Young people and opponents appeared on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to speak in advance of the results of the legislation.
A few hundred beelolorssi gathered on Sunday night immediately after the closure of the electoral seats in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While the results were still expected, many young people had come to protest against President Alexandre Loukachenko's power: "the dictator, the resignation".
Some confess that they have not even voted: "To what purpose? They will do what they want from my vote," says a boy.
They do not believe that the regime which has made a good picture of foreign observers in order to resume dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the ban on visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of goods, could be removed if these elections were considered legitimate by observers.
I didn't, according to the opposition.
"We have been away from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to take part in the vote," Iouri Potemkine, a representative of the Union of Democratic Forces, complained about a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It is a change of facet, underlined by Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate for opposition to the 2006 presidentials and capefila of the pro-European movement, because it is important who cares for the schedules and in this case is the executive.
If opposition Members enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament may include a television space, regional meetings and legislative proposals."
The opposition therefore has the right to enter the political game because "it is necessary to start dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which is heavily in debt to Russia, is in crisis, and we do not provide for any reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition is afraid that the security organisation and cooperation in Europe that has followed the electoral process recognize the validity of the procedure.
It underlines that participation quotas seem too high, and that the generalisation of the vote in advance (26% of the voters in Minsk) has led to all types of manipulation.
"Have you noticed that there were elections? asked social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two free political prisoners this year, in August.
There was no one in the electoral seats.
And there will be at least five Members of the opposition to Parliament, those most qualified to power."
The nightly silence falls on the October square.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission are competing for their success.
The meeting - The blood is again safe
Héma-Québec celebrated his tenth anniversary yesterday, and his president, Dott.sa FrancineDécary, had all the reasons to relax, as Hema-Québec became one of the most secure and effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, he recovered the public's trust, seriously removed from the scandal of the blood infected in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service have been infected by the virus of acquired immunodeficiency (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
Faced with such a drama and the protests of the population, in February 1994, the Government of Canada conducted a public investigation, directed by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent the prosecution of a similar disaster.
While Judge Krever was late to settle a report, some provinces have set up a committee with the aim of creating a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec began his activities, nearly 38% of the people said to feed still trust in the donation system in Quebec, recalls Dr. Ssa Décary.
The situation was deadly.
Thanks to continued efforts to improve the safety of blood clots and research on the field during the following years, we reconfirmed public confidence," explains before saying proudly that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Hema-Québec.
However, Dott.ssa Décary is convinced that "trust is extremely fragile".
Since its creation, on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were many cases in Europe of the human variant of the mollusks, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s mollusks, telling colleagues that he has been in the presidency since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we didn't know absolutely whether that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It is therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, according to which when there are doubts and may be serious illness, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s softness which is manifested with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are adopted.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom was rejected since 1980.
Now, a few years ago, it has been shown that this disease is undoubtedly transmitted through infected blood.
This episode has thus shown us that it has made sense to apply the principle of caution."
In 1999 a much more efficient technique for HIV identification appeared on the market: the tests of nuclear acid (TAN) that allow donors to recognize directly the presence of the virus and not the antibodies against it, on which tests were used until then.
TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, i.e. since the person has contracted the disease to what the first viruses can be identified in blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
The period could be reduced to less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and not being able to identify them is so significantly reduced.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of anti-AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one person over 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, this means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million samples of blood before someone is infected with HIV.
As Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 samples of blood each year, we will need more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted with a transfusion occurs.
I believe that today we can feel calm in receiving or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health, says the head of Hema-Québec's direction.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You don't know what pathogen will appear in the system.
Not later than a year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion that, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted into the blood by an insect.
Hema-Québec has to be constantly alert," continues Dr.ssa Décary before stressing that in addition to having safe resources, Hema-Québec must also provide enough.
"The needs are increasing because the elderly population is growing.
Being treated with the most aggressive cancer, patients often need a package of red blood cells or plates.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the number of donors who, on average, constitute only 3% of Quebec's residents eligible as donors."
However, all healthy people who have worked 18 years and who meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of the people offering themselves as donors are not accepted, because AIDS or malaria attacks, for example, and if they have travelled to a country where the latter is spread, they will be rejected for a period of one year.
"With this 3% we can maintain an inventory capable of meeting the needs of hospitals.
The pension cases are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor group that they are older and cannot make any more donations.
Now it is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but especially to treat them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Today's life is so freaky that it's hard to find an hour to give blood," says detached Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissues, of which bone transplants, eyelid heart valves and skin are used almost exclusively for severe discharges.
These tissues are analysed, transformed and frozen before being deposited at the Héma-Québec, which manages the only public bank of human blood in Quebec.
In the ovarian cordon, which once was considered a biomedical waste, there is enough blood rich in stem cells that can serve to cure serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the introduction into the bank of our smallest sample of cordon blood and we planned to take it more than a thousand years ago.
You should start to propose them to sufferers at the beginning of the next year," says Dr.ssa Décary, who describes this practice of bloodshed of cordon blood as very popular.
"Many mothers are afraid that you cannot have access," because Héma-Québec does not have the necessary means to propose this complex and cost-effective programme in all Quebec hospitals.
Calcio - L'impact in semi-final
The Impact Montréal is qualified for the semi-final of the A series, winning 3-1 against Seattle's Sounders yesterday, during a second decisive game of the final quarter, at the Saputo Stadium.
The central champion Antonio Ribeiro has signed the decisive goal at 90's.
After a first time without goal from both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino identified the following networks for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to mark Matt Jordan.
We recall that at the first game of the return, on Friday, the Impact had immediately a 2-1 squatt at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the Seattle perimeter.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps of Vancouver in semifinals.
On Saturday evening in Minnesota, Thungler joined a first 3-1 in the return game winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semifinal.
The Impact will have to deal with the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed in the day.
In brief - decisive network in Kovalev
The Canadian and its axes are ready to restart the season.
The third format by Alex Kovalev, Thomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the offensive phase of the game by winning 3-2 against Panthers, Florida last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first meeting, marked a goal, made two steps, and collected a pass for victory, in the fourth of the Hab's preparatory games.
I decided to win the only network signed by Kovalev.
"I'm not ready yet, he warned Russia.
I need another game to feel my way."
"He tried to punish in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a great ovulation."
Charest Point to the North
The first Minister does not exclude the beginning of elections before the end of the year.
Finally, the General Council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest, met yesterday in Jean-Talon, Quebec where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tried to make an election on the occasion of today's partial elections.
"Enlarge the borders of our last great northern border": this long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented yesterday to Levis, through instruments from strong visual impact, on the occasion of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
After him, during his speech, the projection of a kind of "Mulino in Images".
On three maxi screens, they were surrounded by negative displays of hydroelectric dikes, mineral cultivations, pictures of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means like full electoral campaign.
During the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to exclude the beginning of the autumn elections, although he noted that he was very committed.
The "North Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, the "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on labour, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
The opening of the Northern Territory to the 49th parallel was often referred to in the most recent talks of the Prime Minister.
However, the prime minister was limited in explaining that the North would be "a joy from the enormous potential", but it did not speak of temporary or investment quotas, as it did not explain what the precise priorities of future projects would be.
More and more, it has been limited to point out what it considers to be a priority position: hydroelectricity, forests, but especially the mineral sector, which has experienced various improvements following the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructures.
The North contains "Nichel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
The "large territory the double of France" is here, is Quebec.
It's not just here, but it's in us," he insisted, as he wanted to call for a national founder myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the golden febble in Abitibi, the national engineering, the Bay of James.
"Waits for us, it is our future," he added, after a theatre break to observe the huge map on his back.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, has specified the first minister during the press conference.
"It is a traditionally maintained position by all governments.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and when the occasion comes, I will re-establish that position on behalf of the government," he said.
The rest, "in view of the climate changes, the North needs to reassess the North," said speaking about the passage of the north-west, which will be open for all year due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister considers it a duty to occupy the territory."
What about the locals, the First Nations and the Inuits?
The first minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful about this and that the project should meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (ex-member of the PQ d'Ungava), have already taken the lead in consulting a community of thirty.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, where Julie Boulet (Transports and Natural Resources) has taken on an important role, has started the work.
The first Minister does not exclude a great meeting," not necessarily a summit," but a moment when common vision will be provided.
The development of the North would be at least in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Piano will be concerted, ordered and respected the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuation with that of the first liberal ministers who have done so.
"As the liberals who have preceded us, we know different ways of transforming the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was another of the current themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes re-establishing the Beauharnois Centre in Diga Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, Creator of Hydro-Québec, in Lesage, who nationalized hydroelectricity, in Bouursa, the creator of Baia James, our party has always known the future," said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, another reference was made this time, conservator, John Diefenbaker's "Strade to the North" program, the first minister from 1957 to 1963.
In the context of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric design project, Charest stated that its function would be planned for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel that we will do it," he confessed to his soldiers, raising warm feelings.
In fact, the first minister, who said that in April there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not lose the opportunity to launch a survey in autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He stressed that he must be very committed, particularly in a mission of the Federal Council in China and in the Quebec-New York Summit.
The General Council at the end of the week provided the Liberal Capitol with a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular the "constitutional aspirations" which have been put forward as oil: the PLQ in particular calls for the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It is also hoped that Quebec will be the names of the members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council and that they will have a right of veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
With regard to the opposition, the draft North Plan was adopted in a sceptical manner.
PQ leader Pauline Marois responded to the North Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to you, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not have respected the application.
If he did, "we'd progress today" has commented on Marois in front of Jean-Talon's candidate (scrutin of today's event), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said to support the adoption of the North Plan by the government.
"What we hope for is that all of this is not just perceived as a show," commented the leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, in the back of today's holidays.
Letter - Unsorted Country
It was Vic Toews, former minister of the "Gisticia" (serious irony) of the Harper branch, to let himself say, the summer last summer, that Louise Arbor was a "dangerous" for Canada.
It is this way to detonate a woman who has fought relentlessly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about both the prime minister's entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
First of all to a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, has not returned one of its citizens to the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that has nothing to do with the fact that Omar Khadr was a simple teenager at the time of his imputation.
The only government that, despite having signed the Geneva Convention, renews its word and lets a child soldier be marked in human terms.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
We recall, as an informant, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers, in particular, call upon Omar Khadraffin's repatriation to be subject to a regular process in Canada.
It is the same government that closes the eyes of prejudice to torture: it is very little important that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after many years of abuse.
It does not matter yet, but we are assisting in an insiduous erosion of our rights, freedom and "democracy", a word that Harper does not stop and that sounds so insensible on his lips.
Here we come at a time when there is no morality: we can treat, torture, arbitraryly imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a head of government to this day (to see what will happen after October 14th...).
A number of voters believe that a party that preaches the Virtura, respect for the Law and Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has abandoned what constitutes the reputation and dignity of our country.
It's right here, Mr. Toews, in giving up all of this, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian speech of the Barrick Gold
In the September 17th edition, Le Devor published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, this last statement says that the world's largest oil company has carried out a series of six million diffamation against three authors and a small semi-trailer house with the intention of starting a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of a petition for defamation, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden from Garver.
Because for the Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin any oasis to support a position contrary to theirs.
Little matter to the outcome of the process, the writers and the editor of the book Canada Nero will have to spend a considerable amount of money to organize their defence and fight against a force of lawyers funded by virtually unfunded pockets of the mining company.
In the rest, in these arms struggles, tactics are often the thing to break the agreement in order to impose a consensus regulation that imposes opposition on them, and to inspire any oasis to speak again on the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is in the public opinion that he should have presented his own vision of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada, debates are normal with exchange of views and not with manoeuvres.
It would therefore be sufficient for the company to take its books, documents, and establish a true and well-debated debate, through journals, media, publications and the funding of an independent research team that could shed light on the matter.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to have too much confidence in public opinion and badly rejects the requests and letters supported by the authors of Canada Nero.
Maybe Garver could explain how he can ask for a "public debate" when his prejudice for the same public is clear?
In the world of the vice-president, it seems that this word refers exclusively to the profusely paid lawyers and not to the whole of the Canadians; here is a rather limited vision of the concept.
In a democratic system, even the demigrants have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold doesn't understand – or doesn't want to understand – is that the public who supports Canada's authors and editors Nero does it primarily because he rejects the brutal methods adopted by the mining company.
This public is willing to listen to the Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinions, and not in the look of what many see as a sort of embassies (seeking the "public debate", the Barrick Gold has just given Canadian authors Black an ultimatum, hoping to support the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver's surreal speech, Barrack Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of truth, which is indispensable in every democratic society.
It denies the right to quote authentic sources and the debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss issues common to the world's richest businesses, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards of Canada Black authors.
He's got the right to retaliate.
For a long time, the university environment, which we are part of, is capable of managing debates and disputes and resolving conflicts.
The excessive measures of the Barrick Gold clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not seek a transparent debate.
This goes beyond the university world, as well as the same public debate in Canada, and it is now that governments are taking measures to limit abuse.
Operation - Save for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the Congress's Capitols, representatives of the Republican and democracies, have finally reached an agreement on the largest saving-finance plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US $700 billion plan, which aims to bring a brake to the financial crisis that takes months on Wall Street, must still be ratified by the two Congressrooms.
In particular, it provides for verifications of its effective implementation by elected leaders, new mechanisms guaranteeing the repayment of public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses punished for missing payments, as well as a right of inspection of the remuneration paid to the managers of the protected companies.
The US Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the President of the Chamber of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the representative of the Chamber of Commerce, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day treaty marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an effective market agreement," said the representative of the Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
"Every decision has been made in such a way as to save the economy and the American people from the crisis at Wall Street."
"It's the crucial point: if we hadn't acted in this way, unpretentious disappointments and disturbances would have turned around the American daily life," said the Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the Treaties was marked by concerns about the impact of a new failure on investors.
The deadline given corresponds to the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates to the US Presidency later joined the treaty, however, showed little favour for the agreement, without avoiding expressing their discontent with the adoption of extreme solutions.
The democratic Senator Barack Obama is entitled to add some provisions to the agreement, in particular what will allow owners to maintain their own home and the income to pay for the managers of undertakings covered by the State.
"When the contributors are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the responsibilities of others, there is nothing to be done.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American TV screen.
Interviewed on another channel to find out whether he will vote in favour of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, answered: "I would like to analyze the details, but I hope so."
"As far as I've read it, it's something that we all have to dig and that will allow us to move forward."
The option of a non-intervention is simply unacceptable," he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to recover with the money of contributors the double credit, risk-related and unspent assets of the US financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the creation of a real estate ball that has led first to the collapse of mortgage credit (mutui), then to extend to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and to collapse liquidity and bank and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in charge of sending to the air the first draft of an agreement last week.
It seems to be out of that blind neighborhood since the Democrats have accepted that the active "toxic" of some companies in difficulty is only protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone at Congress, a provision was added that if the government had to deal with losses over the next five years because of this programme, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, which may be added to another 100 billion if the President has to report it.
The sale of 350 billion should be ratified by a further vote of the Congress.
Instead of its aid, Washington will receive shares of participation in protected companies that will close the dividends in case of profit and that it will be possible to resell when the waters are calmed.
As set out in the plan, the federal government will have the opportunity to delay the payment procedures relating to real estate loans and to set limits on the remuneration and leave payments paid to the managers of the undertakings concerned.
From now on, the architects of the plan would like to vote in the Chamber of Representatives, and the Senate vote on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is not yet sure that the way is open to their plan.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, both in the republican and democratic era.
"Of course, Washington does not feel you," said journalist Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Commission.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But I'm not sure to take advantage of contributors.
Leader of a small group at Congress called "the caucus of the sceptics", democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred outstanding economic teachers, including three Nobel Prizes, have written to us to say: we ask Congress not to draw rough conclusions and carefully examine the way to take it," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, one more time was faced with the test of the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would have abandoned its competitor's purchase, in full failure after the loss of EUR 2 billion (2.9 billion) for the crisis of real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is part of Europe's biggest banks and ten largest insurance companies.
"It's not money lost, said Dutch Finance Minister Wooter Bos yesterday.
Instead, there is a risk of influence and voting rights in banking matters.
It's certainly something that rescuers and families appreciate now that times are uncertain."
During this period, at the other end of Manica, the British government seems to be able to nationalise another bank in a car for the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would be charged with the total of current loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than 41 billion dollars (75.5 billion dollars) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would be her to buy the subsidiaries and customers of the British bank.
From the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to raise a nationalisation process by the English government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a busy icon
The beauty of the blue eyes was for a long time his ass in his hand, for others his weak point.
You were released from the Narcissistic mirror, the American actor from the amplifier smile?
Yeah, no.
His discretion, sensitivity and evident talent would have removed him from that circle of powers devoted to the true and sacred samples.
What a coincidence!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at the age of 83, in his joint of Connecticut, following a lung cancer, remains one of the last signs of American cinema in the last few years.
Fewer monumental of Brando, to whom he was a sort of rival on the screen, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also he was a contributor to freedom and the development of dramatic beliefs.
The mixed couples often give birth to magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, the father of a German father and mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots, one of the glorious visions of the American dream will be born.
A humble ego, last brand of quality.
Because in him he recognized all of a country occupied by the safe made-up man, the warrior of the war of the Pacific, proud in the fight, that at the beginning of the 50s he studied dramatic arts in Yale, he later attended the Actor Studio of New York, before trionfare in theater, television and soon in cinema.
The same man for civil rights was also the car pilot who was classified according to Mans 24 hours in 1979, as well as sex symbol, although part of a married model since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
If they go with him the shade zones of a reserved, discreet, committed, allergic star on the show-business scandals, which will never be able to completely awaken the mystery.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
This weekend Paul Newman's absence was a blow to the heart for the cinemas, while his great characters people the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of American cinema in full transformation is proposed through its interpretations.
Butch Cassidy (1969) and that boy unable to desire the focused wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La gata on the roof that was adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember this in the panties of the sensitive Mr Bridge (1990), troubled by a marriage that did not keep much promise.
So many others Paul Newman went through history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tortured, violent, unforgettable in Lassou, someone loves me, by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean and rehabilitated after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That sympathic in the excellent Stingata, Oscar as the best film in 1973.
A amateur and veneer billiard player in Los Spaccone, great film by Robert Rossen (1961), The color of Martin Scarese's money, which was valued by him in 1987 by the only Oscar on 9 nominations.
That face over the years was hers.
He's still here.
The times take place through his path.
Young people know him especially for the cool Slap Shot-Colpo dry movie by George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, an alleviator of a hockey team on a little Orthodox ice.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, the Coen brothers.
The circle was closed with a last role of the Irish mafia's father in Era my father in 2003.
Unlike the lightest grades of the movie that left the show soon, Newman will stay long in the halls, accusing Hollywood of all his passions, festivals and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, defined it, with a point of irony, "a challenge living in the underplaying", judging his performances excessive.
The profession was not always a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, where the roles seemed to fall like manna from heaven.
However, he often preferred the role of the marginalized young actor: neurotic characters, alcoholics, or despairs, of which he expressed contempt and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman has revealed unknown symptoms of his true, punctuated sensitivity.
Jennifer's first time, in 1968 (based on the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with Joanne Woodward's wife in the role of the protagonist, followed a subtle female portrait of melanconia.
He, who lost Scott's son for a lifetime, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a discreet and sad movie.
Among the countless nightmares of Newman yesterday, his great friend and former army partner Robert Redford (who had read together in La Statta and Butch Cassidy) said with great sadness "His presence has made my life and this country better".
Generosity and love for life, two great characteristics of the missing actor.
In addition to a legendary career, there is such a large army for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protestary of Hollywood.
We would have starved his face on bottles of oil, salts, biscuits and other foods, judging him a choice of a nice pet, though born like a gag.
However, the income of those sales was intended for its Children's Fund in difficulty.
Newman, instead of hanging on his myth, he's got a chance to commit himself to the end.
He left a letter to his five daughters that said "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly recognized by his good star.
I mean, it was a privilege."
And it was also a privilege for us to follow the path of an American artist so clean and generous.
Citizens model, then, and much more.
What has been produced in the factory of factors of Zuschlag & partners?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearing of the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates will be discussed.
The political man and his partners are accused of renegotiated commercial fraud in the context of a criminal association that has caused significant damage, and other offences, including falsification of documents.
According to the Search for the money obtained from competition bands, it was used for private purposes, and they often certified the performance of the activities by false invoices.
The state and municipal money, in total 65 million flowers, is partly spent in the Fiatal Balldals, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, known by the inquisitor authorities, they have taken the money received from competition bands on the basis of facts about non-existent operations and the associations have never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the prosecutor's act, most of the facts were false.
In order to do so, the invoice blocks were purchased at the market of Józsefváros, but the circular drums were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And in order to decide on whose name you say to issue the invoices, it was established between the other during the match between the hills over the Balaton where Janos Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the confession of the latter, he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for invoices for consumption, on the basis of these, the invoices were prepared to be added to the competition bands, among others, to those of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the municipality of Budapest.
Most of these are the works of István Lados and András Óri, which, according to our information, has produced, in particular, the relations needed to obtain funding.
One of the choices of Lados' "travel studio" was a bureaucracy.
According to two facts issued by Zuschlag and its partners in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
So many people, however, as the restaurant claims, would not all enter the place together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 at the Jobb Foundation Jövőret, then called Együtt in Harmadik Éveveredétre, a bottle of formal and content errors.
There were only three bedrooms in Badacsonytomaj, more than 10 people could not stay, but there were 130 guests in the fact.
But the compilations of the full of fantasy factors have been exaggerated when they reported the Pigal Kft., and this is also a restaurant, in which accounting - according to the information provided to the judicial authorities - did not even present the documents on behalf of Jobb Jövőret and Hoppa.
Győző Farkas, company administrator, told hvg.hu that when he was called in search of facts, he immediately understood that it was false documents.
"Only I fear the name and the Iva game of our company were found in a wrong place."
He added: In addition to the formal reasons, there was no return to the fact that hundreds of people, according to the fact, had been accommodated, when there were a total of eleven rooms and there were not so many beds.
To achieve the bill was a restaurant and their restaurant is no longer in service for a long time.
The fact-finders were not concerned about informing themselves that Budapest's travel agency from their choice, only organises trips abroad, so unfortunately they indicated about the invoice with payment in the amount of travel in Hungary, which did not agree with the company's practice of issuing invoices.
In addition, as demonstrated during the investigation, the fact was also about Iva, while travel to countries outside the European Union was widespread.
Among other things, the amount of Iva was wrong on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favour of the Foundation Jobb Jövőret, in fact the services offered by the company need to apply Iva to 15% and not to 25% as indicated on the facts, also the hotel's employees only issued printed invoices, while the invoice was written by hand.
In addition, "emissioners" have destroyed other factors, in the case of a particular item they indicated how the transport of goods was carried out on the road, as is known from the investigation procedure, which was not carried out by the company originally based on investment advice.
In addition, for formal defects - caused by non-conformity invoice, false stamp - it has been found that invoices issued in favour of Egypt in Harmadik Éveveredtre Alapítvány, of XXI. Cultures Egyesulet and Bistos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue the facts.
The falsifiers did not pay attention even to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) fed a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület, which is why the curator of the ditate's liquidation, according to our information, refused to issue that invoice to him.
They sent invoices knowingly
Another group of invoice issuers is made up of those who were aware of the need to issue invoices.
The Esély Budapest Foundation Alapítvány has issued a invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjj Socialistták in favour of the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évevértétt of nearly 4 million flowers.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the prosecutor, has persuaded Collab Kft. to issue fictional facts.
He worked together in Zuschlag and his partners the Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices for a value of about 5 million flowers to the Jobb Jööőret Alapítvány Foundation, Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesüet Association, which did not have a real economic activity.
No money movement because the facts prepared were then stored, but the associations forgot to make this look in their documents.
In the next group of these invoices are those that are connected with the taxpayers.
Ad. Ivan Kubatov, authorized to take over the Director-General of Delta Trió Kft, who is located in Budapest but is not recoverable there, who is engaged in fuel and car trade.
It released several invoices in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media for a value of about 18 million flowers.
According to data from the investigation, the Cash Investment Ltd. of Kiskunhalas was liquidated since September 14, 2005.
The Director-General of this department was a Romanian with Ivan Kubatov in 2002 and 2005.
As we know, Kubatov, during the investigation, acknowledged that he had released facts on behalf of the company to the Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt at Harmadik Évevretret Alapítvány and was taken by him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov, Romanian wallers founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Ltd. and Jos-Investment Bt.
Indeed, none of these were operational, because according to the tax they had not received work.
The companies, however, have become useful because, at the request of Zsolt Szente, editor of company foundation documents, on behalf of the companies, invoices have been issued to associations linked to Zuschlag: to Atlasz and to Y-Generáção.
On behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov released 15 invoices for a total value of 14.2 million flowers.
The investigation considers that Kubatov has increased the 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as the Iva.
Man has also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictional invoices, manufactured for the Biztos Pont competition band.
Y-Generation and Society in Modern Magyarszágère in January 2006 presented a band for the public utility of the Socialist Party, TMA.
They also have 500,000 head flowers, but the sums have not been used for the purposes indicated in the band.
In order not to be caught, they presented to the TMA five fictional facts received from the Works Team Kft.
These facts were found during the search for the office of Árpád Kemexei at the Ministry of Public Education.
In the hearing, some of the employees, as they have already done in their search, will probably refer to the increase in the production of invoices.
However, the most interesting thing could be if the tax number one, János Zuschlag, decided to raise the view over everything.
His confession has not been very detailed so far, and although he has promised to speak more than once in a broad way, he has not yet done so.
It is necessary to see if it is in his interest, it may also be said that socialists have made agreements with Zusi, which, in exchange for a resurgence of 50 million flowers, would be much of the damage - would be willing to make the expatriate head.
Zuschlag could for now also be offended because his requests for relief of his prison conditions, i.e. the granting of domestic arrests, have not yet been met.
While the authors of non-resparable and highly harmful commercial offences can freely travel or at least wait at home for the end of the procedure against them, which he does not allow.
The psychology of high bid: why spend more money?
The buyers are willing to spend more, to overestimate the goods.
Neurologists and economists at New York University have been able to discover the neuro-economic bases of this well-known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study on Science magazine, men do not want to stay back in a race like eBay, so they are also available to pay a higher price.
The research has tried to trace the nervous scheme of this "part" at the level of the nervous system through experimental acids.
A group of volunteers played the lottery, the other group of players participated in a show while using the functional magnetic resonance method (fMRI) they examined the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games participants could win the money, but in the star game, in which the material element is the one to bid more than the other, the body stranded under the brain cortex comes intensively into operation when the game is lost.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "autogratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
So according to researchers, the price rise is explained by scanning the old reaction of the strata body.
In support of their theory, the research group's economists carried out a financial investigation.
In this investigation three groups have offered against a partner under different conditions.
They referred to the control group to the actual value of the product concerned and made their point.
To another group, they promised that they would receive another $15 prize in the case of a win.
The third group would have received 15 dollars before the season, but the members of the group would have lost the money if the season was lost.
The difference between the two groups was that for one of them the victory was underlined, while for the other the loss was lost.
By checking the hypotheses of neurologists the members of the group who played "against loss" were willing to score higher than the control group or "winners".
"These results are not deduced by any of the previously existing economic theories.
These facts have so far explained the responsible phenomena to the stars with the joy of winning and avoiding the risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image have helped to resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we have reached a third explanation" - Andrew Schutter, professor of the University of New York Economy.
Hepatitis: when to talk to your doctor?
Nearly half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, in Hungary, but among the first causes of death, chronic liver diseases are mentioned.
In Hungary the number of patients with hepatitis per centile is treated only 7000: the reason is that many patients do not know to be infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name of infectious hepatitis caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between symptoms, typical are hepatitis and hepatitis, but their pathogens and diseases differ from one another.
Hepatitis virus spreads in two main forms according to the pathogen agent: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. water and infected foods), hepatitis B, C, D and other blood-related viruses and organic fluids (sparing, vaginal loss, salva).
For those travelling it is useful to vaccinating against virus A and B, against C there is no vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after the consumption of infected foods accompanied by general illness, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After formation of yellow maces on the skin and on the white of the eyes, the leaves become clear and the dark urine, the healing occurs within two to three weeks.
A million people die every year throughout the world for hepatitis B, the worst variant of disease, which causes liver tumors and liver surgeons.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one person in ten receives a pharmacologic treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can cause liver surgeons and tumors in the liver.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogen agents destroy the liver cells subdoally, in many cases the first symptoms occur after 20-30 years.
Therefore it is very important to prevent and carry out regular medical tests.
This disease is much more common than the average in three groups: who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattoos.
In the world today the number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since a routine laboratory examination also reveals the disease, it is worth noting to the doctor of the family when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is treatable, the virus can be eliminated by the organism, thus losing the infective power and can prevent the formation of tumors.
September 30th is the World Day of the Hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 worldwide by disease associations.
The aim is to draw attention to the viral chronic hepatitis, the causes of its development and early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the results of a recent survey, religious faith works as a species of analgesics that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The scientists at Oxford University have performed an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God influences the feeling of pain, has reported the British Telegraph.
An electroshock was made in the context of the grueling investigation of 12 Catholic believers and other atheists, while all of them observed a painting depicting the virgin Mary.
On the basis of the results, Catholic believers were able to avoid much of the pain.
Thanks to the experimental technique of the human brain, it was found that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for the control of pain.
The test is the first of a series of research that in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers and theology of the University are also involved.
The test was exactly like this: a tool that emits discharges and passes the electroshock has been connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
Researchers have asked participants to concentrate on two paintings, the virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Dama with the Hermlin of Leonardo da Vinci painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the virgin Mary would produce a sort of religious state among the believers, while Leonardo's frame was chosen because it was not too different from the other and held it as a comforting effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time zone they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while either observing or painting on a religious or other subject.
The Catholics mentioned that the vision of virgin Mary made them feel "sure", as if "someone took care" of them and "they were comforted and troubled by peace."
Looking at the image on a religious theme, they took into account 12% less pain than they had before themselves the work of Leonardo.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image from the strong effect also for the atheists, but it is necessary to find the appropriate image.
"We have to look for an image to which they have very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The English bishop Tom Wright was accompanied by the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it can change our personality." - Wright added.
After the excellent results, only the question remains if the painting of a lady of Leonardo or another painter of similar calibre is presented to the believers, what effect might it have on the control of the pain?
Would the vision of a virgin Mary of quality bring better results?
You know what you're saying about yourself
On the day of the 10th birthday Google can claim to be in the pockets of people and their heads in heaven; he knows where the holidays have passed, which ambulances frequent and what interests them.
This, however, says Eric Schmidt, one of the directors of the diet, is not enough yet.
However, as regards the sceptics that make a comparison with the Orwellian Incuba, they do not see the substance of the web 2.0.
Recently Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that the main purpose of Google is to collect more personal data from its users and this is necessary to meet the original goal of Google Founders who were: "we enter into a system all the information in the world!".
According to Google's director interviewed, after 10 years of revolutionary work, he is still able to manage all the information.
To the question what will happen between five years Schmidt answered: he would like Google to answer questions like "What do I do tomorrow?" or "What would the job be suitable for me?", but the software can't answer questions apparently simple because they don't know enough of the users.
Not all internet users are aware that during their online search, the search words are recorded exactly, from which IP address are searched and on which page are the ones that are interested after the search.
Through the Personalized Search started two years ago, users like e.g. can remember their navigation history, they can look at what they have sought and clicked, and they will then be able to generate results on a much better scale; on this same logic it is based on Recommendations that the system offers us products and services based on our previously declared and registered preferences.
What happens if my data are used against me, if they see what I care about? - concerns about Google data monopolies are asked.
In most cases the internal conflicts are caused by the pause being tried for the size of the potential power represented by that one, and not for the sense of guilt, for the fear of punishment, for the desire of freedom or for access to power.
One fact is confirmed, however, and that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but also in motivated cases can be provided to third parties, in such legal cases there is no defence of the personal rights of the internees.
The most exciting example of this has been perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles in recent times, in which Google has provided the Brazilian government with information that has made it possible to identify pedophiles from the page of the community Orkut maintained by Google.
The internals concerned about personal rights, however, expressed a strong spirit in May when the dita - in agreement with the EFF legal protection association - successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: neither can Google be bound at any point of the constitution to provide any information requested secretly by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully deleted almost 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search expressions obtained in relation to the confirmation of the child protection law approved years ago, but it failed to obtain the search lists for individual users and the entire list of web pages and keywords for two months.)
Google’s judgment is therefore rather contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data move Google because they believe that this will affect their intimate sphere and private life by starting to use services and are raised by the rebellion against the multinationals that are speculating for the conservative image.
At the same time, the American geek culture and the proliferation of fans, activists and computer users shared in many countries see in them the future generation of big teeth, the cool corporation, in contrast to their rivals, Microsoft liquidated as the world conqueror because of Windows, as both fight for the same objective.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code kept constantly updated and the software package is much more accessible, young and cool of the official software column practice.
But it can also happen because the geeks see exactly the problem relationship between personal and internet rights, which involves just one of the most frequently repeated keywords in recent years, web 2.0.
The 2.0 website speaks of nothing but collaboration, letting intensively trace behind us and exploit the communication channels to our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: to show ourselves.
A young medium can create profiles in more community pages, from Facebook to Yanga, you can connect them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists your musical tastes, all of which can include them in systems such as FriendsFeed or Blip.fm, you can also write blogs that automatically show your latest photo gallerys stored on Flickr or Picasa.
However, we read of many exemplary cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos cast in the morning from the common circle of friends, comes easily to know who spent the night her loyal boyfriend or a finger can license her employee because she wrote a sincere opinion on the company's top: one thing is sure, the concept of private life has now been fully reconsidered.
Those who live an online life are able to show themselves and thus we can form the basic thesis that is hidden behind the behavior of young people.
Anyone who wants to hide something or just want to avoid Google's monopolies can do it (for example, starting with Scroogle using Google's search system but at the same time he doesn't voluntarily follow it).
There are few people who do not register for community pages to be found, Google's online applications, from the development of texts to image management and the collection of news, can be replaced with alternative versions that are not related to large parks servers and that do not make up our best profile so far.
The public opinion does not even wait so secretly when Google will take out the articles.
Currently, the company with its $156 billion worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), advertising spaces AdWords/AdSense threaten the revenue of the advertising agencies, the services introduced at record time cause serious damage not only to Microsoft but also to many software development firms.
However, critical observers are following all of this alarming points: the company summit, for example, has completely rejected the protest of the employees after they have doubled the company's assets, has considered it too expensive to re-eat the daily pleasure of the employees, but this is also decreasing in the fact that in 2006 Google has China's head to the Chinese government and under their agreement, it will filter all the results that violate the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal rule of this policy seems to be not to publish a new service in advance but only when it will be useful, one thing is sure, that the predictable problems of the coming months and years will move the world at a point: while some believe that Google's project of scanning and archiving books and magazines will take proportions such as that will soon be faced with the U.S. Supreme Court, others have fear of the Health system, which in this way we can create a health profile with our references, medical and problems.
Since Google is building a genetic basis, it can offer good materials to the next generation of fantasy writers, the famous Cory Doctorow's Scroogled account describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google's data can be approached alarmingly.
Two minors helped Ózd's double homicide to break the tracks.
The police asked two minors about the double murder of Ózd, suspected of having helped to eliminate the traces of crime - said Tuesday the police spokesman of the Borsod region.
Young people have recognized the fact that they have been accused of being wrong, and are currently accused of being wrong.
The two minors, two girls, according to information from the ILO, defend themselves on their own.
The benefit shall be payable up to 5 years of imprisonment.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old man of the place, was detained on Sunday.
It's suspected of premeditated homicide for profit.
The investigation led to the young 20th-year-old had a big debt with a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay the debt, so on Wednesday last Wednesday he lured his creditor into a song of Ózd where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to the information provided by MITI the young man was prepared to commit the crime, a sign is that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon on the ground.
The police are examining the weapons and circumstances of use with the involvement of an expert.
The Borsa di Warsaw has made an offer for the purchase of the Borsa di Praga
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion black crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the list of stock shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Borsa, confirmed the offer made by the Polishs despite the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Borsa as possible buyer of the Borsa di Prague.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Borsa di Warsaw is owned by the state.
The 99% of the shares are in hand with the Polish state who intends to sell in a few months more than 60% of its securities.
The Czech financial journal E15 states that the Polish offer represents the highest ever advanced figure for the Borsa di Prague.
According to the Czech press so far, they have presented an offer to the Bosa of Vienna, the Transatlantic Bors Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the Borsa of London and the German Borsa.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange last week, said that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not exclude that this could lead to the close of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Borsa di Prague in 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders agreement, almost 90% of the securities would be sold.
The largest owner of the Borsa di Prague is the Patria Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by the Bank Česká Spóřitelna with 14.7% and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%
Economic crisis from the perspective of European journals
The main European journals in their March comments dedicated to the international economic crisis are already talking about 'second 11 September'.
The global financial disaster has occurred thanks to the US President - accused The Republic - that it was not able to co-operate its party behind an all-embracing law, which aims to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as the billionaire superfinancer Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to speak of a second September 11th.
Also part of Madrid's print is seen in Washington as the spy head.
According to El World, the lack of US political leadership has led to the global economy on the clock.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing ever greater and will continue to suffer throughout the world.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but as a result of the Congress vote, there is the danger that Washington will not offer a political means for crisis management.
The global economy is being suspended in the air, just as capitalism's history is being transformed.
It is no longer possible to trace the threat - the Tags-Anzeiger of Geneva accelerates.
Some of today's states can still offer a lifeboat to shipbuilding financial institutions, and contributors' money can save them from failure.
But if more and more banks collapse as a dominant effect then they will no longer be sufficient neither financial means nor new solutions.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and to concentrate on control over the Member States' financial markets.
Only Monday did the weak financial institutions get more than 100 billion euros - recalls the Venice Der Standard, which seems to be more realistic than European contributors, like the Americans, will have to hand their portfolio to solve the crisis.
The EU has not so far been very concerned about the crisis that has passed through the old continent as a tsunami.
The "salvations" should not immediately cover EUR 100 billion, however it would be better to establish where the taxpayers' money should be spent to prevent major damage.
The smart machine imitates the flight of the calabron
What could be the best way to develop anti-collation technologies if you don't imitate the senses of natural obstacles?
For example, those of the apples.
In the surprising project presented to CEATEC in Japan, the calabrons gave the first strategic insight to engineers Nissan on how to build the next generation of anti-collation systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built the biochemical robot BR23C, a small robotic robot providing the properties of api, with the ultimate aim of creating a system capable of scanning all collections.
Flighting the Appi forms an oval personal space that really resembles our protective shield - explained to the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, director of the PR technology sector and research and development.
Important is the role of the app view, capable of a 300-degree visual in each direction.
The engineers drew attention to the idea of telemetric laser to copy the function of the app view.
The BR23C detects the obstacles up to two meters in a range of 180 degrees, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately turns it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of second, the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the wings, changes immediately by turning the wheels of the measure necessary to prevent the incident.
This avoidance manoeuvre, unlike the current system, is carried out in a manner contrary to the current system.
"If it wasn't for the robot car, he wouldn't be able to react quickly to avoid collisions," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must respond in an instinctive and immediate way because this technology corresponds to the most damaging and internal layer of the protective shield, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what makes a needle to avoid other needles.
This process must take place in an eye battery.
But unlike the wings, the deviation cannot go up or down or in diagonal, it can only be bidimensional and in the direction of sterility of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities available for the wings to scan the other wings, the robot, as the possibility available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow.
The BR23C is fed by batteries to lithium polymers, lighter and high energy density, which means that their duration is higher than that of lithium ions.
According to Andoh, it is important to keep an intelligent reaction, not developing data, or even less the ability to store it.
This robot must develop some input in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to remember them and react with intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvre data, so use only a few decades memory of Kb.
There's no need for a gigabyte memory or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of colleges that, provided for in Nissan, can be installed on serial vehicles within 10 years.
Additional application options can be represented by the unifying with the GPS satellite navigation system that avoids the obstacles on the road leading to destination.

The written version of the Economic Savings Act of 700 billion dollars for the purchase of disproportionate loans has been edited, to be applied in most parts.
In the first step, half of the sum is spent.
In the new agreements, until Wednesday evening, according to the time of the East Coast, the convention leaders have decided the rescue plan of 700 billion dollars after a debate that lasted for days - referred to Reuters.
We have taken a series of steps forward - Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the American Chamber of Representatives, said that he has just left the agreement on the letter.
Both the presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise of the plan.
Minister of the Treasurer Henry Paulson spoke of the outcome of the compromise: the programme will work and will be effective, but there is still much to do. According to Pelosi, it is not about the saving of Wall Street but about the investment of the economic car.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets at 8 a.m. in Washington (the 2nd night of the Central European clock), but did not produce a large increase in the boroughs.
On Monday, the Chamber of Representatives will vote first on the proposed economic stabilization law of 2008 on the programme, and then touch the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to the Pelosi on Saturday evening, and welcomed the news of the agreement at the White House.
We are satisfied with the progress made tonight, and we appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy - Tony Fratto said he was the spokesman of the White House.
The programme, however, differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which provided that $700 billion would have been spent all for the purchase of securities with disproportionate credit on the back.
Now as a first step you can spend at least half the sum of $700 billion, 250 billion immediately after the vote on Monday of the Congress, with which the Ministry of the Interior will purchase securities with disproportionate loans on the back, the remaining 100 billion dollars will be decided by the President.
A special college will monitor the program to which the President of the Federal Reserve is also taking part.
The other half of the 700 billion costs depend on a new decree of the Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of the Interior can apply a combined tactic: it can also buy credit, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "sniffened" credit.
The purchase can take place through axles and directly - they have announced the ministry's competences.
The legal rule makes it possible for interested parties to take part in an insurance programme where the Ministry of the Interior guarantees the means of concern for which companies will pay an appropriate price for the likely damage.
Henz Paulson said that the law provides the necessary means so that 700 billion dollars will come for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, which is about the purchase of incorrect financial means, or their insurance or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all the steps necessary to make us ready to enter the law as soon as it is signed - it has added.
Bank managers in crisis and waiting for state aid think that the government will limit their well-being, defined by the oil chain simply as a golden parachutist.
The limits of payments will only occur in some cases, and the limitations depend on how the Ministry of the Interior will provide assistance.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry is to buy in the form of a stake, it will impose a fine on the gold parachutes, if they do not send the de-dedicated bank manager to retirement.
At the time of the purchase of the disproportionate credit, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the money of the directors is not excessive.
In addition, the existing contracts of the golden parachute will not change, the limitation is valid only for the new to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation on the remuneration of the general administrators - the president of the committee responsible for the financial services of the House of Representatives commented on the provision.
In addition, the state has the right to be eligible for a share of the banks participating in the programme, reducing the risk of contributors, since they can also gain if the economy, together with the saved bank, is to be re-entered.
The legislative proposal includes that in the next five years the President must submit to the Congress a proposal on how to repay the contributors the expected losses arising from the financial sector.
Of course, both sides were those who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what the American citizens have asked us not to defend the contributors' dollars - said the Republican Member of California Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague of Ohio Mary Kaptur believes that the measures have been taken by the same people who are responsible for the Wall Street storm.
Continue to increase industry prices
The prices of domestic industrial sales in August 2008 were increased by 0.1% compared to the previous month, by 12.9%, compared to August 2007 - report to the Hungarian Statistics Institute.
Export sales prices of the industry reported in July 2008 were higher than 1.1%, compared to the previous year, were reduced by 3.9%.
As a result of the change in domestic price and export costs, industrial production costs were higher than 0.7% compared to the previous month and 3.2% compared to a year ago.
The prices of domestic industrial sales reported in the previous month are only increased by 0.1%.
The prices of national sales in the labour sector are also reduced by 0.1% compared to July.
The increase in prices in August 2008 was verified in the leather and shoe processing sector (2.8%), in particular the bags and belts with 4.6% and the production of shoes with 2.5% monthly increase.
The high price of plastic and chemical raw materials has caused a significant monthly increase (1.6%) in the product and chemical sectors.
A decrease in prices has occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4%), in the production of electrical tools and machinery (0.9%) and in the production of wood (0.1%)
The prices of the paper production, editorial and typographical activities are not changed.
In the other sectors of the labour industry, an increase in prices was observed between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector prices are increased by 0.3% in national industrial sales in August, first due to the dominant effect of the increase in gas prices by the authorities from 1 July.
Paragonized in 12 months, considering the national sales of the manufacturing industry, the larger increases were in the processing of petroleum products (32.4%).
In the manufacturing sector of products derived from metal processing, the price increase was 13.2%, 11% in food, drink and tobacco production.
A decrease in prices occurred in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the production of electrical instruments and machinery (0.3%).
In other sectors of the labour industry, the rate of price increases varies from 0.6% to 9.1%.
In total in the labour industry last year, prices rose from 10.2%.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water sector have exceeded 18.7% of those in the past year.
In the national sales between the target groups of the sectors, the largest increase in monthly prices has occurred in August in the sectors producing investment goods (0.7%).
In the sectors producing consumer goods prices have increased by 0.3%, prices in the energy sector and subsequent use have not changed compared to those in the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month last year, the higher prices were observed in the energy sector and subsequent use (16.8%).
In the areas producing consumer products, the increase was 6.8%, a decrease of 1.4% was measured for investment goods.
The prices of industrial export sales calculated in flowers were increased by 1.1% in August compared to the previous month, compared with 12 months, by 3.9%.
The Hungarian flower in a month was weak compared to the euro of 1.7%, compared with the dollar of 7.1%, compared with August 2007 it increased by 7.5% compared to the euro and 15.9% compared to the dollar.
The next year in the United States?
King Göncz sees the possibility of entering into force on 12 January in the US-Hungarian visa exemption agreement - the Foreign Minister has spoken about this in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
According to his opinion, "now everything depends on the fact that the electronic system of entry and control is built in time".
However, he called attention to the fact that in the new system there will no longer be access permits, but the tourists will have to register before departure.
The responsibility of Hungarian diplomacy will continue to extend to Washington today.
You will meet with the Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, who will deliver the medal of the Hungarian Republic's Cross with the Star and will open talks with foreign policy advisers from the democratic candidate Barack Obama and the Republican John McCain.
Also Barack Obama and John McCain were shot in favour of the bank rescue plan.
Barack Obama and John McCain, candidates at the presidency of the two major American parties, assured Sunday their support to the government plan of $700 billion for bank rescue, however, there are politicians who claim the resignations of the Minister of Treasury.
The representatives of the Congress and the administration after the long-term marathons for days announced on Sunday evenings that they had concluded a principle agreement on the bank rescue plan.
The Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market financial package have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to show themselves more suitable from their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent surveys with the first stage of economic issues Obama has recovered a bit of advantage, while McCain's advantage, obtained after the Republican convention with the appointment of vice-president Sarah Palin, was dispersed.
Obama, in a speech in Detroit, expressed the hope that the convention would soon approve the law on the plane of $700 billion.
He stressed that the proposal contains those steps of consumer protection that were also supported by him.
"Now we must act responsiblely (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, the full economic stability" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
McCain's economic ideas have not been left to define.
McCain in an interview to the ABC explained that "all the more we will continue with difficulties this situation (...) but not doing anything is a road."
The Senator of the Republic said that the proposal included the creation of a control committee of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good outputs of the top managers, which he was stressing.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no merit in the agreements, but he was in contact with the minister every day.
President Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that the Chamber of Representatives will probably vote on the proposal on Monday.

The right-hand pole is intact, only within the right-hand pole voters have become more aware of the car – so Der Spiegel analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Hayder's party is ready to rule Austria in order to prevent the red-near coalition.
Mirror (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the online edition of the German magazine on the left, in the article The Baviera Revolution destroys its parents and analyzes the causes of the dramatic failure of the CSU.
According to the well-known politician, the CSU's erosion has already begun long before the sad couple Beckstein-Huber entered the cargo.
The Christian-socials have renewed the Bavarian for decades, and right now these modern citizens are away from them.
The change of time is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as is Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a great surprise for the CSU, but it ended a process that was realized exactly ten years ago: the inevitable egemony of a party-state is over.
10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU was estimated at 47.7%, for the first time under the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago to the Bundestag elections in 2005 in the period of the so-called Stoiber.
This is the result of the subsequent modernisation in the region, which destroys parents.
Sociologists have predicted it 40 years ago, but they have gone too far. However, secularization, the results of education, the placement of East and North Germans in the developed bazaar region could not remain without consequences for the integrity of the electors to the CSU.
Modernization goes hand in hand with increasing opportunities and the political consequences are evident.
The pole of the right is intact, only inside the pole the voters become more aware, critical, hosted.
It is also surprising that over the past few weeks CSU has isolated the classic bourgeois groups: free professionals, artists, diplomats and graduates.
The support for the CSU was under 40%.

The daily conservative came to "Who with whom?" in the article "The presidents of the parties are blocked in the issues of coalition" concerns the confusion of Austrian internal political situation created following the elections.
The SPÖ intends to deal with the ÜVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the intervention of the SPÖ in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ shows itself open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still don't want to discuss coalition.
The elections have been held, now all around the coalition; in the public TV discussion, the party's leaders have just seen the cards.
Werner Faymann, President of the SPÖ, confirmed his intention to deal with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties, in some regions and in social partnership already exists.
Faymann has left the question open to you if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, current president of the ÖVP, as vice-president.
As he said, Schüssel-Molter's course was in any case rejected.
The repeat of this direction shall not be considered.
Mulder has responded wisely to the red bids.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not have been successful if Faymann tries to get involved in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
If your party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition is still an open thing in the party, questions will be discussed in any case within the ØVP.
Jörg Haider leader of BZÖ has repeatedly been open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-nergy coalition, we are ready to assume the responsibility of government," Said Haider.
Járóka: The vision of poverty and segregation needs to be extended
Today in Paris, the European Summit for the Couple of Opportunities, organised by France this year by the presidency of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party, in a message addressed to the plenary as the main rapporteur for the Congress, called attention to the school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation that affects Roma children and in order to achieve the most serious obstacle to their claim.
Minister Xavier Bertrand of France for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner Vladimir Špidla responsible for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities opened the conference at the highest level.
The conference included governments, European social partners and representatives of the major European civil organisations and the protection of rights within the framework of equal opportunities.
Járóka, according to the press office of the Fidesz PE parliamentary group, recalled, in addition to discrimination in the allegations, that Roma are expelled from the labour market in the first place because of their low education.
"Most young Roma do not have the title of a medium-level study and as a result of the elementary teaching of poor quality only an unusual number of them can reach a title higher".
Járóka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in estimating human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to make these connections more widely known between Roma and non-Rome.
In fact, the first time the school starts a Roma, the more it is possible to become a productive member of the labour market; through the taxes paid for income and consumption, it contributes to the budget of the nation.
"The right of European Roma citizenship must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and secret schools" - Lívia Járóka stressed.
According to the honourable Member, the European Union's purpose and action is needed to accelerate the disintegration of schools, and this is why it is essential to ensure that the existing anti-discrimination directives are respected.
"The visual cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, and Roma children need to be given the opportunities granted from the democratic space so that they can contribute as full-time citizens of the future of Europe," he asked Járóka.
In the context of the 'European Year of the Paris Opportunity' to ensure for all, the purpose of the European Summit for the Paris Opportunity organised every year since the Berlin meeting last year is to ensure a single forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at national and European level.
CSU: paper for a transitional period
At the end of October, we will decide on the fate of the infected couple Huber-Beckstein.
Despite the serious electoral failure, the texts have not yet been lost, the meetings of the Bavarese CSU have been referred to as the time when personal questions were discussed.
The President of the Erwin Huber Party and the regional governor Günther Beckstein remain in his place, the question remains until the petition takes place.
Of the fate of the tandem which has caused a disastrous loss of votes of 17% will decide the party's extraordinary convention at the end of October.
The two very criticised politicians have made it clear in any case that they are not being attacked by all forces at the seat.
They have thus tried to eliminate the angry inscriptions from the parliamentary group and the base that one day after the "Bavarese tsunamis" claimed the personal consequences of the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under the direction of Edmund Stoiber then at the end of his career, the Christian-Social Union received 60.7%, but now after the collapse of the state against Stoiber, it was 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years has been "associated monarca" in Bavaria, which gives 18% of the German GDP.
Although conservationists in the southern region are always of fundamental importance to the Hungarian economy, they will be forced in future to co-ordinate themselves.
What is the first sign of the reorganization within the party is the Vice-President and Federal Minister of the Horst Seahofer Agriculture, who is considered to be the potential heir to Huber, takes a position in the restricted exploratory group that will initiate treaties with the FDP liberals and with the Liberal electors expressing right values for any government coalition in Monaco in Bavaria.
For a strange plot of fate in the list of the Liberal electors, Gabriele Pauli's attitude against Stoiber was used as an opportunity to strike by his spouse Huber-Beckstein to treat the woman without regard to the great ambitions.
CSU leaders now concentrate all their forces to stabilize in some way Beckstein.
In the meantime, Stoiber will also play an active role, which has so far been in the shadow. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU has defined the day of his political career on 28 September.
Monday Huber issued some statements to the CSU, according to which they would deserve greater support from the brother's party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be cancelled after the Bundestag elections set up for September 2009 unless the CSU has been sent in common forces, which has played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory.
According to Merkel, which does not hide the delution for the profit, the loss of land of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the great coalition of Berlin.
This is certainly true: it will not be easy to manage the wounded CSU, but the social democratic crisis is still difficult.
The SPD has achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
Not even a representative of the opposition entered the Belarusian Parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, the sign of well-being and stability in the country guided by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), is explained with the booklets made in the volume of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people in a country of 10 million people is free of opposition for more than a decade, prior to yesterday's elections, the opposition gathered under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) was expected to be serious that Lukashenko, with the new presidential mandate for the fourth time following the constitutional change in the 2006 elections under discussion, "conceeded" some sitting in Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS has thus abandoned a previously evaluated pollutant.
Following the expectations of the opposition, Belarus, increasingly economically dependent from Russia, asked for a loan to reduce the import of Russian natural gas increasingly expensive and agreed to give the Russians the gas pipelines across the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians could not enter into the anti-democratic political situation of Belarus.
It referred to a distance that the OSCE in assessing the electoral campaign had put emphasis on positive movements and not on the shortcomings, such as the ban on being presented for one third of the candidates for the opposition.
The OSCE's rapid report on Monday, however, also criticised the campaign, during which the applicants of the opposition in practice could not appear on the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present in the polls.
Despite this opposition, it is understandable that there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also willing to do little with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, even if Russia, with which Belarus is a federal state, considers the two countries to be independent for a month.
We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - has been declared in our newspaper Aleksandr Millinkevich.
According to the presidential candidate for the 2006 election opposition, it is expected that despite the fact that "the power had been afraid to make one opposition even into a Parliament without weight."
The opposition does not provide for protest actions for results, but rather tries to bring the voters to the message of the need for economic reforms.
Of course we have many problems, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, for distribution the local authorities were having difficulties, but I also see that more and more people support the change, even among the elderly - says Milinkevich, referring to the fact that even the most officially assisted ceto, the pensioners, is considered to be appropriate for the Lukashenko regime, which considers its main result to be the creation of social security.
Because of the country's isolation and the increase in economic deficit, it is only a matter of time for the disintegration of social security "which recalls sepolcral silence" - Milinkevich believes.
In contrast to the opposition policy, the Russian observers judged the elections democratically.
Sergej Lebedev, president of the Independent State Community, told the Russian press agency RIA News: "Men believe not in words but in fact," so the lack of opposition is nothing but proof of maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that we were able to get in and out of the employees.
But from now on, he takes this new measure against the furbets, against those who are smoking and then he's going to drink a cup of coffee at the bar in working hours.
The novelty of antifanullon was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services," said the Minister.
"Now a new stage of responsibility and transparency is opened.
This is reformism," Brunetta still points out.
With Palazzo Chigi, the installation is completed in all the palaces of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of railway ports is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There have been no resistance from employees, the Secretary-General ensures: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was cooperation between all".
In summary, no more meals in working hours; no more coffee and cornet.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a beautiful cappuccino at 7:00 a.m. is a holy hand."
In the course of a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister then notes that "in three months the sickness allowance for public employees has been reduced by 50%, i.e. 60 thousand people over work in one year".
It adds that it is necessary to make public administration more efficient.
Italian, "which wage dynamics - explains the Minister - in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates."
So many thousands of public employees are united to challenge the requirements of the Brunetta decree by joining the Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Service is failing today, numbers are about the least absenteeism at work due to disease - writes the association of consumers - the people of the 'opportunity' are growing.
In fact, there are thousands of people in Italy who are members of the public administration who are united to declare war against the illegal rules contained in the decree."
In particular, Tar will be responsible for the exclusion of additional economic treatments for diseases dependent on the cause of service; the extension of the time limits of reperability of the sick worker, including the visits to control, and other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Incidents of work, Napolitan: "Crescent Prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 incidents occur, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, Inail's data confirmed that white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and cause almost twice the deaths compared to the murders.
In order to draw attention to institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, Anmil now celebrates the 58th National Day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data spread by Anmil and the same chronic signs of these days confirm how crucial it is to prevent work," said the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the president of Anmil, the National Association of Amil, Mutilated and Invasive Labour, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expressed his "live appreciation for the continuing partnership commitment in order to prevent jobs, protect the workers who are involved, help the families of the victims and raise awareness of public opinion".
"Of course, there has been an angry 'too much', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedy, which, for their size, provokes the cllamor of the media and the involvement of public opinion, but daily reality calls for dramatic, even repeated cases in their dynamics."
Napolitan does not hide that "there is no doubt also a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
In a significant sense, many initiatives have been promoted in the school field for a more direct awareness-raising approach by young people facing the world of work.
It is necessary to pay attention to the phenomenon, not to dwell in the alarm about its social severity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
The President of the Gianfranco Fini's House stressed that "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which violates the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions an urgent commitment towards end-users".
"The data on infoturins on the work seem to indicate a slight positive move, but this does not remove the number of white deaths as impressive as it is," noted the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We would not, in fact, want this "surpassing tendency" to be translated into less attention, because it is right when attention is encouraged to explode the tragedy.
"We believe that at the general level it is still too little to counter the phenomenon of infoturuns and contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
We need more controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this comes from the school's world."
"It is worth further efforts - it has added - with regard to the communication and awareness of public opinion.
But, above all, it serves a greater sense of responsibility by employers in relation to a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of pension protection envisaged for the victims of work" and the "assisted assistance to which the system has been advancing in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to return the insurance guarantee to the employer - he added - because the fate of those who are involved should not depend on spontaneousism or sometimes extension provided by the legislator."
Mp3 readers under charges, risk hearing
Listening to high volume music for a long period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent audio injury.
This is what the European Commission refers to, in a communication published in Brussels, the opinion of the Scientific Committee on emerging and recently identified health risks (Csseri) published today.
"From this scientific opinion - it is read in the note - it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than one hour a day holding the high volume device risking a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who often use portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unwittingly harm their hearing in an irreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific findings - continues to be responsible Ue - there is a clear risk and we must respond quickly.
More importantly, we need to raise awareness of consumers and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, in order to make them fully effective and keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise from them.
"Scientists - which concludes the Ue executive - confirm that there is a cause of concern and the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and interested parties what measures may possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music devices and fine equipment".
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music equipment to 100 dB, but there is growing concern about hearing damages that may result from excessive exposure to these noise sources.
It is possible to limit many of these damages by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee notes that the users of portable musical equipment if they listen to a high volume (more than 89 decibels) of music for only 5 hours a week exceed the current limits on the maximum noise allowed at work.
Those who listen to music under these conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
This would involve 5-10% of users of these devices and their number could be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Germany gives the Commission the way for the future of capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, in June the sums will be taken away.
This is the calendar set by the Campidoglio for the work of the "Committee for the Future of Rome Capitale", which took place this morning in its new seat behind the Terms of Caracala.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other Commission components will set out the guidelines for Rome.
Once the combatants are closed in March, the Günta and the Council will evaluate and design, so that they can present the Strategic Plan for Rome in June with the "official ballot" of the Campidoglio and its German union Gianni.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and there are all the political, social and cultural ideas - it has to underline Germany - it will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome, the political decision-makers remaining in the Community and the Council.
There is no sub-position of roles, but only the desire to have a place where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March it will finish its work and then it will disappear, because this experience must have a precise time-limit.
In June - it announces the union - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital."
To those who accuse the Commission of uselessness, since its opinions will not be binding, Germany repeats: "All depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of its proposals.
If there will be quality, both in France and with the Italian Commission, and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
It is too often the policy on day-to-day management and on the emergencies that sometimes occur.
On the contrary, we want to look longer and longer, in a deeper perspective, working with seriousness in the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the Roma union has to point out that "this Commission is neither an empty entity nor a car: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to justify and involve the best intelligence that the capital expresses."
For Germany, in fact, "there must be a strategic, non-closed and real-state reference design to allow our city to make a genuine level jump, which it has made absolutely necessary, thinking with a single spirit in its future."
A future that, according to Rome's union, "will not be limited to the current municipal borders but will save much more" not only in the Baltic Sea city and its legal status of capital but also "in view of the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first American president.
He wrote an American political note that has to pass on to us as independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions made the US economy and had relations (as it does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam".
The attacks against Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
She wrote a lady of Miami on a website: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big dumb face: he believes he will win the highest rank of a nation that has in all two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, there are attacks that do not say much; they are clearly racist attacks and do not answer the electoral question: will he be a good president? Still there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win and with a good distance.
Even in this case there is someone who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the southwestern United States, wrote an editorial: once in the cabin to vote we know who will give his vote to the American patriot.
It goes out one side of the US's mind is covered up to the last.
"Tell me what you want, then we'll think about where to put the crochet, whether on Obama or on McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama should win, we'll leave America.
Things never happened before now, which appears almost certain to the success of the black candidate.
Despite all these reasons, however, the winning weapon for democratics is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his mission? The 89 percent replied: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent to the house to stand by.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives, and the Americans have not been forced to make the pilgrimages.
However, Iraq for the majority was Bush's weak point.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge task to do.
Use, the economic traccle is also about journalists: in the journals it's time to cut. And many blame the Internet, "killer" of the printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center on the state of their profession and mental control regarding the future.
Well, today the journalists are almost all pessimists in their future.
However, the newsmen have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for U.S. journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destructive economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put the journals together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that will be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if you do not want traditional journalism as the public understands it, to be substantially replaced.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today in the U.S. journalist.
You are on 10 senior newspapermen and executives are convinced that the national newspaper is following a wrong path.
In the local area, the group is 65%.
Printed against Broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
Most editorial houses open a ship to the Internet, for many views such as the "killer" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are using technology in the hope that they "do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism today is among those who run the newsrooms - namely the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national executives are sure their reporters share their values, while at local level the percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this has to do with "job security."
Executives who think of losing their job in 3 years are 47% at national level.
For the reporters' staff, it's going to 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (our editors, etc.) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a vast nation like Usa, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and Internet employers often offer what they want and thus become a question of "take it or leave it", take or leave it.
Directors receive almost always large wages, while the editor can also earn $10 thousand a month, as well as pensions and insurance payments.
For holidays, then, the reason is complicated: every day after the first year, every third to get to 15 days complete after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, for their admission, are often "amply" during the year.
It's all climate issues.
UNIPOL: Roma trial, DANILO COUPOL RISTA AND GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the Roman court, Carmelo Rinaudi, decided to reject the property owner Danilo Coppola who asked him to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in the city of Rome.
Coppola is a banknote in the context of the investigation of the dispute concerning the Unipol-Bnl scale.
In the course of the process in its charge, last week, he obtained the removal from the homes transformed into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate owner could pass the road from the province's town to a residence in the capital.
According to the court, however, these transfers (which the pm said otherwise) would have had an effect on his company and access to the evidence that he was accused of.
The elites at risk
The phenomenon was already shown a few days ago with the vote of the Chamber of Representatives against the savings plan of 700 billion dollars from the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and it is, more interested in putting Wall Street to save the economy.
It gives us a confirmation of the New York Times yesterday by informing us that the ongoing crisis is spreading the Republican Party, more and more divided between its old soul East Coast, moderate, favourable to the federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, host to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, especially in the Central and South states.
The soul, for the moment, has been made too alive by the vote I said at the beginning.
But this is just one example of changes, big changes, which the current economic earthquake may announce or already let go: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps even here.
Both in the U.S. and in Europe the crisis seems to work as an acceleration of time-consuming phenomena that in the new climate are solidified and finally brought to light.
The first of these phenomena is the renewal, the extraordinary relaunch, of the dual category of State sovereignty in relation to a sort of economic renationalisation.
The crisis is, in fact, crises of banking and financial institutions which have, yes, links with the outside, but which are first of all largely involved in the balance of people and families living in a single country, in a single state.
What immediately creates a political problem for those who rule it: and that is how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, inter alia, are also elected.
In summary, the global economic crisis appears, but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be essentially out of play or not to have much to say: the lamp test is given by the European Union, which usually divides between the various interests and the various national strategies cannot decide any common political line.
And so it is from the government of each State that all expect intervention, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and especially fund-raising: since when it comes to the streets, only those States that have economic resources are the majority of financial resources capable of trying to put things back in perspective.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, under certain circumstances, which probably no market or international organization can ever have in a similar way.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the state-national element is still in perfect harmony with the ever greater importance that recent economic developments tend to attach to a very closely linked factor: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we were now going into the kingdom of the network, of sophisticated technology, of materials, and we were convinced that globalized finance was now intended to dominate the world, we realized from a treaty that our future should rather be doing the accounts on a growing scale with those very little material things that are water, crops, oil.
All things that, look a little, can certainly be transported from one place to the other of the earth, but are entirely connected to one area, to a territory.
So that whoever is found to be superior, he certainly has many letters in addition to those who are not, to those who have the effort to live in a place without collections, without oil and without water.
I'm coming to the second news that shows up, but it's a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for volunteer leadership, the request of someone who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discrepancy for existing leadership, economic species, such as inadequate appearances and full shade areas.
And together something even deeper and in some disturbing sense: a discrepancy, an insatisfaction, an image of inequality, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire class of leaders in a growing number of Western countries.
It seems that this is becoming more and more the road, in large sectors of the population, the belief that before their actions are the same ideas of social elites up to now, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall acceptance of the term, having made their time and becoming more and more foreign to the opinions of the majority.
The request for leadership, in summarily, provides a ramacitary but capable movement of delegitimation of the leading classes and traditional political seats, which is reflected in the electoral "revolts" or the recent events of the collective immunities of these last and last days, from the conservative presence in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of the labor consensus in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy has something to do).
It is the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rituals, their journals, their intellectuals, their credentials, their format would make someone more difficult to understand, and so to represent, what is not taking place in the deep strata of Western societies today and that the economic crisis is growing, and potentially dissipated.
In the face of all of this, talking about a "major rebelion" on the agenda would be fairly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes clearly open is certainly not for anything.
The superchole to walk on the walls
Defeat the laws of gravity through a super hill and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of several American research centres and now a team of four institutions has gone very close.
The students were able to hold a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall with a thickness of just 2.5 square centimetres.
STUDIO – American Science magazine has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scholars is an evolution of those who use a particular carbon structure called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of the neck can be imagined as a series of tubes systemed as a spaghetti pile," explains zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by geese’s wings, covered by microscopic skin that can ensure perfect animal adherence.
Tests conducted on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adaptor is ten times more powerful than the branches of these rectangles and at the same time "sit easily from the wall" explains Liming Dai, researcher of the University of Dayton Engineering.
COMMUNITY ON MURRI? - "This material could be useful as a transitional guide" adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use than the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are hot and electric current drivers.
Other applications may concern aerospace engineering.
For the moment, there's no superhero.
The ALTRA RICERCA – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to the search for a new subscriber.
In an article on the magazine of the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars have presented an adhesion form of microfibre as hair that are self-pulsed by dust during the movement on a surface to maintain a perfect adherence.
Pharmacs: more fruit juices
Attention to the juice of powder, oil and honey.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summers because they are dilute and rich in vitamins, if they are used at the same time with some healthy drugs, they alter their absorption by amplifying or by reducing their efficacy with serious health consequences.
To redefine the risks of fruit juices, freshs associated with the use of some medicines, David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who, at the 236th American Chemical Society meeting in Philadelphia, has launched a new alarm: just a bottle of powder, orange and honey to reduce the absorption of some healthy medicines, cancel the effects and endanger the health of patients.
The powder juice was already finished under the charge because it was considered responsible for increasing to levels considered toxic the effects of some antiarrhythmic, antibiotics, anesiolytics, antistatic and neurological medicinal products.
Pharmacies A RISCHIO - The same Italian Pharmacy Agency had reported in a leaflet two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mix and to pay attention to what is being done in the case of medicines such as Diazepam or Metadone.
NOT only POMPELMO - Experts also believe that orange juice and honey contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active principles inhibited by dust and other sugars.
From here the call by Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the State University of Milan:"These findings are reported immediately to the various international and national pharmaceutical agencies that are likely to change the information notes of the pharmaceuticals.
So reading the illustrated pages of the medicines that you are taking, and if there is something that is not clear, do not impress us but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarifications" has highlighted the expert at the Ansa agency.
The Nobel Prize for the Economy in Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for the Economy was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on trade models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a neokinesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known editor of New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the choices in the economy and foreign policy of Bush administration.
A few months after the attacks in September 2001, in the days of Enron's fall, Krugman had planned in an editorial published on New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A vision that is not a bit vague and which has been addressed to the economist for years, but which has now become clear.
"I am surprised and also somewhat shocked about the speed with which the memories of scandals like Enron or Worldcom's collage have disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a disclaimer with a very aggressive style, particularly critical against excessive liberalism of Bush administration.
Open Office, here's the third edition of the "anti-Micro" package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the suite open source of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from house to house, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the most known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year's work by volunteer developers, in which SUN Microsystem monitors SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office shows itself to the large audience with different news: the welcome screen and the less open and easy-to-speech interface, if they add more substantives such as the native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Attention also to interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as what allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example for sending them via e-mail, or the possibility of importing PDF files into the graphical development module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front you can create 'PDF hybrids' documents that combine the typical Adobe format graphics with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text manufacturer.
Cooperation is an element that has received various improvements within the applications: in the calculation sheet, more and more users can be involved, avoiding conflicts on the changes, in the test laboratory, each partner is assigned a color in the comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice functionality on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should deliver the final result.
The Italian version is downloadable at http://it.openoffice.org/download/0.0/Download300.html and added it to the English that was on Friday's mirror.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation CD can also be sent at home or at work on request.
And if the topic of freeness can be a train for the dissemination of the houses, it is right in business that Open Office then tries the large bribe, and can already count on various projects already carried out in public administration and schools.
And they do not miss even the realities that offer an ideal training, advice and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding Word; Calc video script, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for powerpoint emulsions; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on the database; Draw, it is finally the graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that you can also exceed the expected figure.
Also Kohl positive results is the fourth case of doping
A new case of positivity in the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third-classed and winner of the best scaler sword.
To report the news is the website of the daily team.
The 26th Kohl is the fourth positive corridor to the Cera, the third generation's Epo, after the Italians Ricardo Rico and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, as well as the Gerolsteiner.
The analysis of Kohl's blood samples coincides with that carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories in Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the controls confirm the positive in Cera, Austria will lose its third place at the Tour and will meet in two years of canonic squallation.
Confirming the news of Kohl's positivity to the third generation era is the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordy, who informed the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26th Austrian was placed on the final podium on the back of the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also adding the yellow to the top of the ladder.
Immigrant: NEW YORK TIMES AND CHIEDE, ITALIA IS RAZIST?
Italy "from a country of immigrants has only recently been transformed into a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with a return.
This is transforming the Belpaese into a racist nation? Is it how much it is asked in a long article the New York Times that has dedicated a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting from the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan to steal a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what Nyt defines as the "paradosso of the north": the northern regions are at the same time those where it registers "more integration and more work" but also the "higher anti-immigrants feeling of the country and the highest support to the North Law".
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, Nyt also mentioned the episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
The new legislation required by the Law which binds barriers to immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestine prisoners is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
The emphasis is placed on both the Pope and the president of the Republic: "George Napolitan meeting Benedett XVI at Quirinale asked that the State and the Church work together to suppress racism."
Car rental students up to 900 euros per room
The purchase market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the last survey of the Sunia, the residents' union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken very serious characters at the point of excluding the whole range of young people from the right to the study for the highest comprehensive costs that families of origin should support - explains the responsibility of the Sonia's study office, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand from students has so distorted the market to introduce a process of generalised growth for residents."
In the majority of cases, the tenders contain a series of infringements: free type contracts, not registered, without limit of cannons, related sub-debts.
The Union needs extraordinary intervention that, through the revision of tax taxation, can ease prices.
In view of the details of the investigation, we see that in Milan, for a bed place in Brianza area, about 450 euros are available; for a single room there is a minimum of 650 (Black Bande zone) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (Vittoria zone).
In Florence an average bed place is EUR 350/400, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrated in the areas near the University, they had EUR 250/280 for a double bed, from 370 to 500 for a single bed.
In Rome in areas near central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) are asked about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a flat in a double room.
Values only slightly lower (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other universities (Ostia and Civictà).
Only if we move to peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 one single in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples, 300/450 euros are available for a room, from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed place there are 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a higher weight in the city economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of rent to extra-Community students, such as Perugia, is most common, an additional anomaly is recorded: the increase of about 25/30% of the canon required by foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Old Addio cinema Paradise, cities cancel the historical halls
The historical cinema rooms are closed in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinematographic halls is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the Josephe Tornatore registries takes a picture of what is happening in the great Italian city centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of the great multisals and the subsequent death for the consonance of monosales in the central areas of the city, is one of the events that seem inevitable and undisputable but also has all the features of a real and own cultural crime.
Often there are historical places and memory loads, "it's like if a friend came down less than a friend, a familiar one with whom we shared a piece of street and so many emotions," observes the director of New Paradise movie, the film that spent twenty years in Tornatore the Oscar prize and the Grand Prize of the Cannes jury, and that contained the poetry of a provincial hall and the nostalgia for a way of living the movie that may have been lost forever.
The figures provided by the Anec, the main association of the performers, are clear: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have been closed, and paying the highest score are mainly the rooms in the main cities: 10 in less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are Emilia-Romagna, with 82 persimmonsal cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardia (41).
And to demonstrate that the first responsibility for their disappearance is the occurrence of the multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new multisalam cinemas: 195 screens in more in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exercise has developed irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is important that new structures are built but should ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its participants are willing to move to multiplex.
In order not to talk about the lack of funding for the fund in favour of the taxpayers: the State's advance debt is about EUR 10 million.
It is shame, from a ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not comply with existing laws.
In order to support the sector, it would serve between EUR 16 and EUR 18 million a year".
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about the closures, has decided to run to the repairs with the signature of a protocol between Comune and Anec, the first of which is in Italy, to protect and promote monosala cinemas both in the historical center and in the periphery.
Among the standards provided for are tax facilitation measures for managers and public benefits in terms of mobility: inspectors may enter the restricted area and have special rates for support and some parking.
"It's an initiative I like," observed Josephe Tornatore, and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bologna by taking other measures.
It is true, however, that in order to counter the trapping of the multiplex, traditional halls must also improve the quality of sound and image, because public is more demanding today.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinism, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the stencil that convinced me to make "New Paradise cinema", which I had been thinking for 10 years.
I live in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk before the Rialto or the Quirinale of the National Way now close, where I have lived so many shared emotions, so that I don't see the cartridges worn by the dust I turn around from the other side."
Links between politics and arrested union of Joia Tauro
"The union of Joia Tauro was available to unify the Community's choices to the interests of the Piromelli coska".
The charges are heavy that the judges of the Anti-Calabria Directorate refer to the union and vice-president of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torreone and Rosario Schiavone, and the union of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested for external competition in a massive association.
At the same time, Joaacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his lawyer, homonymous of the boss, has already been sentenced to association for mass printing crimes, sentenced to 10 million euros.
"In spite of any legal and moral standards, as well as the good sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations expressed their desire to pay consultations with the lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been so given to the coast - they would have written the judges - to enter officially within the municipalities by facilitating the possibilities, already extensive, control and address of public administration."
The president of the Calabre regional meeting Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusions between local and malavy organizations are similar" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than elsewhere, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are many local politicians who resist the pressures of the dragonghet, heroes who keep themselves clean."
The arrests in the morning follow those of last July with which the police announced that they had decapitated the Piromelli castle.
By the end of April, Gioia Tauro's municipal council had been dissolved, but already in 1991, and always because of alleged conditions between organised crime and local administration, local policies had been raised by the task of administering the Community.
Giorgio Dal Torreone, a union union of the Udc at the time of the divorce, was elected head of a centre-star coalition, after the vote in May 2006.
He screamed at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the expulsion of the municipal council.
He called on the Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of archiving everything for a political issue, but the judges, in the pending arrest order, explained that the Piromolli was entitled to request a change in the A3 project.
From the environmental interviews ordered against Dal Torreone, they write the pms, "the availability to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representing a wider group of well-known people near Piromalli, uniforming the choices of the public administration to the interests of the coast".
When energy is born from where it now descends into the field and big
It is a cut-off, which covers more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now being discovered by major global energy companies.
Where, currents, seas are the new renewable sources on which the eyes have been placed, and now they try to put their hands, like the Chevron.
The possibility of getting energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the oil price dropped, about 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now environmental tensions and the new oil increase are driving the sector.
London’s World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15 per cent of the global electricity demand could be covered by sea-wide power plants.
This would be the double of what is currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And more would be the currents and the seas.
I'm stuck in the attack.
The first shipping company was Enersis, who signed an agreement in 2005 to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When the mind was announced, it seemed like a revolutionary step.
For two years, it has always been more and more, among these companies, who have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the technologies on oceanic energy - he said the spokesman of a company associated with the U.S. oil collusion to the economic daily Wall Street Journal - and is assessing the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation concerned concerns the granting of a permit from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
It is a sign not too little, especially if it is considered that in Alaska, the Usai continue to extract oil and recently President Bush has launched a plan for new earthquakes.
In addition to Chevron, there are New York’s Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey’s Ocean Power to travel the way of energy coming from the sea and the sums invested so far, as it is not known in the details, according to observers, indicate an interest in rising.
Technology to put the point.
Experts are still talking about a technology to trees, even because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now the facilities like that Portuguese or some in Scotland are small sizes and do not seem to create serious problems in the ecosystem.
In order to produce energy on a large scale, however, technology must be used with a greater environmental impact.
And the choices are different: the Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of bonding between them.
The push of the waves, which moves the boots up and down there, is converted into hydraulic pressure from pistons and cylinders inside the galleys.
The pressure causes a turbine to rotate, which in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to river through submarine cables.
There are now four systems of this type in the way of design, pending only federal approval and part of energy could serve as a military installation.
The Verdant Power, however, already produces energy for a commercial centre and parking using six submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of water when there are the seas makes the turbines rotate, creating a rotary movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said he had a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorisations to use energy.
After them, the sea.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electricity, is now worth the potential of the seas.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the sea is more predictable than the wind, the sun, or waves and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
It is about the energy of the seas that were like that of New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others on the coast, have already invested 7 million and half a million dollars in 2008 and planned investments up to 35 million for 2009.
