Fired in French Chemistry
The Great Fire in a particularly dangerous chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen was destroyed. It shared with the prime minister of Normandy on Friday. The fire was destroyed on Thursday night. No one was harmed when it happened. The fire was used with about 200 exhaust vehicles.
The contents of the fire could be ordered
Anrainers were invited not to leave their houses. Buildings around 500 metres were evacuated, schools and children's homes were closed on Thursday. In the chemical work at the site of Hisins, additional substances are produced for foam. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US-Millardar Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive, which provides for strict safety ceilings.
About 400 people are working in the work. The chemical industry has already provided for the past for cutting lines - about as of 2013 the gas methanthiol flows through a lake, and the environment is largely after fall. In 2015, the city's water system was flooded by an operating drop of about 2,000 litres of mineral oil.
A woman announces her job to look for 57 days after her lost child
For two months a woman from Washington was looking for her missing dog - and announced her job. The seven-year-old Border Collie was away from the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days from the hospital every trace was missing.
"It was scary. I was used to it," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake". She and her husband had left Hündin Katie in the hotel room while they went to the hotel for dinner. When they finally returned to the hotel, Katie was gone. They searched for the animal, but without success.
Donner had a dog in panic.
In the hope, Katie could still stay in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She's been gone about four, four and a half hours ago," Carole King remembers against "Daily Inter Lake". Once the automatic entrance door opened, Katie immediately disappeared.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the kings were looking for their favorite dog. But for days, they were never given up. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake", who announced their job as a postman to continue their search for Katie.
"Flow the trains"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King received a call: One man reported and said that Katie was in his court. However, when he arrived there, Katie was already gone. She looked for the neighborhood and suddenly stood in her ear under a tree. "I just wanted to leave her. I didn't want to leave her," said the King, "The trains were floating. The people kept in their cars, rising from us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found them."
Lost in the Federal War: Machine weapons disappear free of charge
Friday, 27 September 2019
Six machines of type MG3 are still missing.
In recent years, the Federal War has lost a number of weapons and tens of thousands of ammunition. Among them are three machine guns. The remains are unclear in most cases. The opposition speaks of a "depressive" dimension.
In the Federal War, weapons and ammunition are always disappearing again. Since the beginning of 2014, the Troupe has charged the loss of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and almost 20,000 ammunition. This is the first list of the Federal Defence Ministry, which reports on the German edition network.
According to the paper from the Office of Defence Secretary Peter Tuber of the CDU, two weapons, one weapon and 3474 ammunition have been re-discovered. In addition, six machine guns and parts of the MG3 type, eleven weapons of type G3, four weapons of type G36, six signal pistols and two P8 guns are missing 30 weapons for machine weapons of type MG3.
The extent of the weapons and ammunition losses at the Bundeswehr has been "exceedingly"," said left-wing Bundestag's director, Martina Renner. This is so much more true as it has been found in the course of investigations. The left-wing politician spoke of a "required balance". Renner criticised that the list did not recognize whether the missing ammunition was also those who had been found in connection with the findings against the under-terrorist federal criminal Franco A. "And although a supporter of Franco A. has recently been condemned for the possession of this ammunition," said Renner.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after his arrest by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas today on Friday. As ship observation data show from Refinitive, the tanker was moved and lost the Iranian port. Port Rashid was indicated as the target port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had already been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but at first he remained in Iranian waters. From the shipyard it was said that he wanted an official order from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was brought up on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Gardens in the Hormuz Sea in order to ignore security regulations. However, it was suspected that Iran had responded to the ongoing arrest of an Iranian oil tanker in front of Gibraltar, which belonged to Britain.
The road of Hormuz is one of the world's most important maritime routes. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the global oilport is being moved by the sea. The tensions in the region have been very strong in the past months. The trade ship was involved in the conflict between the United States and Iran.
Markel deserves the courage of people at the Peace Revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has acknowledged the commitment of the people in the DDR, who were on the streets 30 years ago during the Peace Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had brought the former DDR regime into the Wanken, said Merkel at a festival of the Thuringer CDU Group on the first day of the German unit in Erfurt. The Chancellor recalled, among other things, the occupation of the Stasi Central. "The state security was taken away," she said.
Mouse is running the release record
Teslas Quartal may have a record ready. Despite the delivery tree, there was the last loss of the electric car company.
New York.Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong promotion on new records. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries", Musk wrote in an e-mail published in the "Electrek" industry blog to Tesla employees.
The demand was strong so that Tesla 110000 orders could be booked, there were further written in Moscow. The challenge was to bring the cars to the customer. In addition, Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible to the quarter.
Investors found this: Teslas shares went with a plus of more than six percent of the trade. The course has been so strong for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered 95000 cars well and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to reach his high goals. 2019 wants to deliver 360000 to 400,000 cars in total. In order to do this, there must be six numbers in running and coming quarter year. In particular, the most valuable Tesla Model 3 has been asked, but here are few gains. Despite the boom, there have been losses.
Puzzle solved: That's why we can't kill ourselves
A kind of bremse in the big brain prevents people from making their own whales. This has been found by Humbledt University in Berlin with the help of experiments with rats, as they reported on Thursday afternoon. Progress has also been made on the question why children have been so fiercely opposed to the whales, just to demand more.
Finally, it has also shown why only the presence of a kitten's hand has already been released before the exposure of Lakes. This is on a deeper layer in the Great Lake, which has already dissolved the Lake at the time of the waiting of the Kitzeln.
Previous studies have shown that rats react with "Lake" in the ultrasonic area when they are bitten by humans. This "laden" will be transmitted through the part of the large-scale urchin, which will serve as the central processing of the haptic perception.
Lachen is underpressed during self-transmission
So far it has been said that the brain can differ between self-transmission and other transmissions - that is why people can't make their own whales. However, the Berlin researchers have now found in the experiments with the Council that the lake is underpressed as well as the activity of the relevant area of the major brain during self-transmission. This is also true when living itself. During breast-feeding and breast-feeding, however, the activity in the brain and the pulse have been strengthened.
However, passing the self-conducting and the treatment by others at the same time may also be oppressive. This indicates that the brain of the Council cannot even distinguish itself from the self-conducting and the behavior of others. The new findings showed that humans cannot make themselves a whale, because self-transaction activates a brake in the brain.
The rats have also been trained to kill themselves. This is sometimes accompanied by early warning, flight behaviour or shock star behavior. This ambivalentity is the same as the behavior of children. The ambivalentity of the whale is a behavior reaction that is similar to that of rats and humans.
Catastrophe rejected: Great Fire in French Chemistry
The Great Fire in a particularly dangerous chemical work in the northern French city of Rouen was destroyed. It shared with the president of the Normandy news agency AFP on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night.
According to authorities, there should be no health hazards. The samples taken give no reason for alarming, as President Pierre-Andre said during a press conference in the morning. No one was injured when the incident occurred. The fire was used with about 200 exhaust vehicles.
Schools and childcare were closed
People were invited not to leave their homes. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and children's homes remained closed on Thursday.
The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US-Millardar Warren Buffett
In the chemical plant at the edge of the Seine, additional substances are produced for foams. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US-Millardar Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive, which prescribes particularly strict safety ceilings.
In the past, the chemical industry has already managed to break down the gas methanthiool by means of a leak in 2013 and the environment has been largely after fall. In 2015 it fell into the city’s water system after a fall of about 2000 litres of mineral oil.
Brexit: Johnson criticised by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first sitting in Parliament after the break in the mid-term. The Prime Minister is concerned that the country should be brought out of the EU on 31 October without an agreement, and that Brussels should not rely on its requests for amendments to the Brexit Agreement.
Regarding Cox, which had been used for the rest of the UK in the European Union, the Premier said: "The best way to honor Jo Cox's thoughts and to reunite this country would be to complete the EU's strategy." Cox was killed during the referendum campaign by a legal extremist.
Mansion to join Oslo and Utöya will be filled in
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deaths on Saturday in Norway, the monument "Jernrosene" (German: the Iron Roses) is composed of about 1,000 famous roses. They remember the roses that thousands of people had spent in the days and weeks following the attacks in Oslo.
At the same place, the project of the artist Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be completed - the roses have been ruined by people from all over the world, including survivors and victims.
On 22 July 2011, the justice terrorist Anders Behring Breivik launched an auto bomb in the government district of Oslo, and in connection with the island of Utöya Dutzten, participants of a holiday camp of the youth organization of the social Democratic Party were killed.
Iran is free of British tanks
The UN general debate did not solve the Iran conflict, but there is now a smaller problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" established in Iran was able to move back into the sea. It could be a piece of puzzle in the Iranian President Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" has been in international waters since mid-July in the street of Hormus in Iran. After release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shiperie Steina Bulk reported.
The "Stena Impero" had left the port of Bandar Abbas and the Crew is now in particular for medical examinations after Dubai, explained ship owner Erik Hånell. On Wednesday, the ship left the Iranian waters. "Be sure it's over," he said to the Swedish TV sender SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London referred to the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to interfere with the freedom of the sea. We work with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," he said on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had established the tanker on July 19 under the pretext that the provisions of the sea law in the Persian Gulf had been violated. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members were able to deal with the conditions, Hånell said. They had been professionally treated in view of the difficult and exciting situation in the past ten weeks. The passengers are now working to regroup with their families as soon as possible.
The British Government, following the establishment of the Stena Impero, encouraged a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar: At the beginning of July, a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was intended for Syria, was placed on the chain. The delivery was replaced by the authorities following EU sanctions against the Syrian country. The reference to the ship had been received by the British of the United States.
Iran spoke of "piratery" and feared the consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Immediate measures have been taken to get rid of the "Stena Impero" like London.
The road of Hormus is one of the world's most important maritime routes. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the world's oil exports are being moved by the sea. The tensions in the region have been very strong in the past months. The trade ship was involved in the conflict between the United States and Iran.
Following the tensions between Tehran and Washington, both countries are at a time of nuclear war. The Americans are attempting to develop Iranian leadership to build nuclear weapons. Iran is back. The United States, in 2018 alone, was exempt from the International Atomic Energy Agreement, which would prevent Iran from building an atomic bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has established the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country under pressure to impose a stricter and more extensive agreement on other areas.
Because of the strike around the "Stena Impero" and other events with tanks in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the US is working at a coalition for military protection of commercial ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for safety and peace in the streets of Hormus at the UN Voltage Assembly in New York. With the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protection for the safety of the ship in the Persian Gulf.
India has a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
In view of the fact that the U.S. President Donald Trump is against Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to re-equipped. The financial heads of Asian companies who consider their production from China to be one of the preferred alternatives are India in a survey of the U.S. as one of the preferred alternatives. This is not limited to the invasiveness of the Chinese-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to have been created to play an important role in the globally distributed production chain.
But now India itself has been created in Trumps Focus. The White House’s hautegen has been regarded as a "kingdom of the Walls", in the beginning of June, the United States has removed trade benefits for 2000 products. The US is currently in possession of Indians prohibiting high rates and requires better market access to agricultural ducts, mobile phones, Spirits, motor vehicles and more.
In the World War II, the preparations with India are free of charge. In addition, America considers the world's largest democracy also through the security policy threshold. Delhi and Washington are also bound to worry about China's claims of power in the South Indian Ocean. On this basis, a rescue of American sanctions against India is unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has also taken up a second five-year term of office, should therefore be safe.
The problem is in another place: The empirical theory that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult situation in the socialist Republic of India. Its reformer is mainly aimed at bureaucratic Irishism, which has been fueled in the multi-ethnic state for a long time by every entrepreneurial spirit. Companies now receive faster construction developments for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more difficult insolvency and competition law create conditions for companies with seemingly high debt to liquidate.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the appropriate rankings. From an economic perspective, in India, in the first five years of fashion, there has been a lot of better use. However, this is not true in trade policy. In order to protect internationally less competitive companies from foreign suppliers, the national conservative government has even created new barriers.
In the West, the fashion of the energy reformer, who is economically reformed by his country, is not to blame for the fact that the charismatic prime minister is only very well aware of what Vokabular Western managers like. In the core, the "India First" lawyer never turned away from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from starting up anachronistic processes and thus becoming fit for the global competition. Business people who survive the closure of their industries are members of the nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party's nationalist group.
Construction by Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French President Jacques Chirac is to be sent a report next week in Paris. The former Head of State will be held on Monday at the Freehof Montparnasse in the south of the French capital, the news agency AFP reported on the Chiracs family. The order will take place in a close family circle. For Sunday, a public funeral in Paris was held as reported by the media.
The competitor was aimed at: Dabo is the first secret hero of the Light Telematics-WM
The world peak was already in the goal when the Khalifa International Stadium was playing the warmest scenes below. During the first time, Jonathan Busby found more than 5000 meters out of Aruba dangerous. He was almost 300 metres ahead of the goal, he was in a rather narrow position when Braima Suncar Dabo, from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau, suddenly dropped him down and supported him by the last half of the stadium rounds in the target. The forces were still at hand to stop the ongoing arming race. As long as the scenes were not enough, the scenes were not enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after running in the Mixed Zone, when he was totally surprised by the attention of the journalists gathered. First of all, he didn't want to talk about his heroism. Finally, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he noticed that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a sufferer. And even though he was proud to represent his country, which was invited by the World Alliance. In normal circumstances, he could not have started. "That is why I am proud to run here for my country," he said.
He did this on the night of night with nuances - and much more intense than he had thought of it. Because this gentleman will be remembered. Once Dabo's competitor busby even took over the destination and voluntarily took over the last place - well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this course. It had not been used at all, because the busby, with much help from the target, was disqualified exactly because of the end of the world-light telephony connection.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and was studying there in Lisbon, was invited to set up a personal best time at the WM in Doha. This was due to official data, although at 18:10.87 minutes, he was still disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I've been back in 18 minutes." However, only in training, there are no best times.
Millions of men: Egyptians fight for wild protest days
In Egypt security measures have been strengthened in the event of possible government-critical protests. At Cairo's centre on Friday a police presence was observed. Several U-road stations were closed, roads were closed around the central Tahrir Square.
In recent days, the police had reinforced their road controls and partially searched the telephones of foot soldiers for messages and photos related to the protests.
Against Al-Sisi
Last week in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez, and Mansura came to protest with hundreds of participants. They opposed the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critical corruption and mismanagement of the economy. One such open protest against political leadership had not been given in Egypt for years. The Egyptian construction contractors and actor Mohammed Ali, who brought the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, today called for a "Millions March" in central places in the country. Ali asks for a "People revolution". The man is for most young Egyptians, however, not even for "Gunter, but for the sake of helping them."
The number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to increase by two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1.570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESSR) and the Human Rights Organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests.
Voluntary arrests
Many people have been "willingly arrested", "only because they were 'in the wrong time at the wrong place'", said HRW under appeal to law enforcement officers. The charges against the arrested are due to their advocates' statements of "distributing false information" to membership in a "terrorist union". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces were questioned and searched in uniform, but also in civil clothing, according to HRW data.
HRW also criticised the scientists in the North African country. The government is blocking Cairo websites and online services to join further protests against Sisi.
Online dealer: senders should be able to make return easier
For online dealers, many returned packages are lost. About 20 million returns are on the ground. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online dealers such as Amazon and Zalando how they can spend returned products instead of destroying them.
Although it was not possible to exempt companies from the sales tax on stocks, the Ministry explained on a question of the Green Bundesags Group, which reported the news of the Funke Media Group on Friday. However, the traders could lower the market value of the unsalely returns so that they did not have to pay any or only a few sales taxes.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg have found that the federal citizens are re-sending every six packages on orders on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - countries respectively in Müll. They would spend additional money after current legislation, as the financial authorities assess shares such as sales on which they are taxed.
Green Group chief Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify that companies can not properly assess sales products and can spend free of charge on non-profit organisations. The companies had to be able not to afford to be punished for spending. This applies not only to online handling, but also to other businesses from the modelling to the construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There has never been a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", should be extended first.
Banksy's work is underpinned by "the restoration of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy to the basic understanding of animals and tribes". From Saturday, the image of Sotheby's in the British capital will be displayed until it is expanded on 3 October. It will be estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first issued in the Museum of Bristol in the southwestern United Kingdom, where Banksy lives. This year the artist re-examined the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on 29 March. At this time the work that had previously been called "Frequent hour" was called "Devolved Parliament".
The image could change the owner for a million.
Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivered a hard exchange of views with the opposition at the first meeting of the Underhaust House following the suspension of a forced break by Johnson by the Supreme Court. Johnson wanted to complete the two already moved Brexit on 31 October without agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, joined the Brexit debate. In Dover in the south of England, he painted a picture that depicts a man flying a star of the European flag with a knife.
Brexit debate is like a space walk in the park
The fierce attacks of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit-Gigner in Parliament do not lead to a climate of the Hasses. Compared to the election fight before the Brexit referendum 2016, the current controversy is a "space passage in the park", Dominic Cummings said on Friday at a book presentation. "We will enjoy it. We will be exhausted (from the EU) and we will win".
Johnson had hit Brexit-Genner in Parliament a lot in the past few days and accused them of the people, including the "Court".
Cummings said that the only way to restore peace would be if the honourable Members would finally respect the British' decision on an exit from the EU, and it is not surprising that the people were surprised by the fact that the UK was still not excommunicated three years after the referendum.
In view of the vote taken on Friday, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called on to remain silent. "We should talk with each other with respect," said it in a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan Prime Minister Khan demands Uno-Engrey in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister, Imran Khan, once again called on the United Nations to take action in the Kashmir conflict at its first event before the UN-Volun assembly.
Otherwise, it would be a war again between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India, Khan said on Friday at the Uno general debate in New York. "If it goes bad, you hope to win the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented it".
India and Pakistan, since their independence from the British colonial government in 1947, have fought three wars, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both atoms control a part of Kashmir, another part of China. In the beginning of August, India in the Indian Kashmir region had lifted its autonomy and thus increased its tensions in the relationship with Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the storm of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts strongly. With sharp munitions on the population, over 2000 prisoners are forced to join the 60,000 political prisoners who are already imprisoned there. Protests have never been dangerous in Egypt. However, since the adoption of General Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the State Assembly has done everything to prevent a scenario like in the times of the Arab spring.
But one of the solutions to the 2011 protests was the bad economic situation. Poverty, hopelessness and the feeling of being overcome by the government itself are driving millions on the road. And this is a problem that even the regime of El-Sisi does not get into the grip of the strike, no matter how hard it is to deal with the opponent. The situation has even deteriorated.
Since 2016 the money has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. Anyone who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket has to decide who is funding: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is responsible not only for the oppression but also for the largest economic actor. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and many more. This has already been done before El-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, also the dilemma in the supermarket is old. Critically it will always be, if a large amount of fuel is rising.
Tüv tests in terminal: BER Chief: No "showstopper" anymore for main city airport
Two months have been tested whether the complicated installation unit is working for BER brand protection in the joint game. The operators are satisfied with the process. However, the tyre is not yet completed at BER.
After major TV tests at the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This was safe, said Mr Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control panel.
The airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful final test, but he also said that there were still some shortcomings in the terminal. "We have many details, but we don't have a real showstopper." He assured that the schedule was still in place until the start of the operation.
However, there is evidence that the temporary reserves should no longer be too large. The construction indicator is now to be implemented at the construction site during the first quarter of 2020, which was intended for this harvest at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of gaps in power cables are still to be overcome; the train wants to check them until February. "To create the conditions for the flight operation, it must continue to work intensively on the processing of the defects," said a written communication.
Lütte Daldrup said, in many cases, it is a lack of evidence, less a new cable. There is also no release for all the cables on which the cable tracks are tied. The airport chief expects it to be available for years.
In addition, fire protection is not yet satisfactory when moving to the railway station under the terminal. The problems had already led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoking speeds that run down at a fire like a lead wall so that the smoke does not spread. They need to go far down. 36 engines have to be replaced. Then a new experiment with hot gas is to be made with the start of the year.
Problems with fire protection and further damages, as well as planning errors, delay the opening of the airport for years. It should initially start in 2011. The costs have risen from two billion in 2006 to approximately 6.5 billion in advance for the next year.
Since the passenger numbers in Berlin have increased significantly, the authorities are planning to expand the airport, which is why it should take place in a special session of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as President Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new business leaders. Finanzchefin Heike Fölster is changing at the end of the year to the German Bahn, staff chief Manfred Bobke- von Camen goes to rent next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put the airport finances on fixed feet.
Chemnitz: Automated for Drugs - Police take man into custody
He needed money for drugs - and he was looking for a number of machines in Chemnitzer City area in the air! Now he's finally sitting in jail!
In the past two years, the number of broke cigarette and parking cars in Chemnitz and the region has increased dramatically.
After two detonations, the police arrested a 33-year-old German on the city street and on the Further Street in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the findings of the conduct of explosive explosions in a real unit with a particularly severe case of diesel power led by the Chemnitzer criminal police, this suspicion was not only confirmed against the 33s."
Contrary to the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer was now in total eight.
The police speaker: "With the beute, he has apparently financed his interdependency." Only four times, the bomber broke down on the public street between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019.
The total damage is at least EUR 60,000!
The automatic bomber is now in charge of investigation. Police investigations against him continue.
It is thought that he was also responsible for further automated explosions in Chemnitz and adjacent circuits.
AUA takes Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group sums up its strategy for the Vienna airport. During the price struggle with ticket pilots such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the AAU's daughter "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", confirmed an Austrian airline press speaker against the APA on Friday. She had previously reported "AviationNetOnline".
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa Airplane Eurowings will thus be resolved. From the current seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. This takes the AU from January 2020 to "wetleyase", including Eurowings personnel. In Salzburg three Eurowings Jets will be stationed in the future, which will be operated by Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines for holiday purposes. Vienna will be taken from Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA crossing and network planning, the speakers explained. The flight times should be agreed on connection flights. The aim is to strengthen the Vienna crossing and, on the other hand, to develop the decentral traffic from the Federal countries.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as "Production Company" for the AUA Group Brothers. This would include Barcelona and Rome with the AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings devices. The board product should be adapted to those of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and air carriers are from Eurowings. Eurowings starting with the AUA flight number will then not be reported in Terminal 1, but as the AUA in Terminal 3.
After the Niki-Pleite, a prize competition was launched. The Ryanair daughter Laudamation announced on Thursday that the fleet in Vienna would be set up on 16 summers. The Irish air carrier sends four Ryanair machines and Crews to Vienna, as well as the so-called "wetleese", which criticised the company as a relational structure to the collective agreement.
The Air Force Commander Michael O'Leary's argument that Lauda has been over the AUA for five years, rejected Andreas Otto on Friday, "We remain the number one in place in five, six or ten years".
Queen-Enkelin Princess Beatrice is fired
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four are married. Beatrice is divorced!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: At the beginning of the month in Italy, Eduardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) was supposed to have held the hand of his friend Princess Beatrice (31). This was announced by the Palace on Thursday.
"We are very happy to be able to announce our release. We are both very happy to begin this adventure together and can hardly expect it to be actually married," the couple, who has shared the British media reports since October 2018, said in the official communication.
And further, "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that in the coming years, love and happiness will be very helpful to us."
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures

A Royal Party
The wedding will take place in 2020. More information on date, location and everything else will be known in the coming months.
But it is certain that the mixture of the number nine of the British throne and the real estate mogul will be a similar big party like the dream of Eugenie on 12 October 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, excessive weight, unhealthy food - there are risk factors for heart disease. But what really solves a heart failure or infection? Hamburger researchers now want to look at the legacy of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
Over the analysis of the legacy of 9000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to find out more about the causes of heart disease.
The research project was the largest in the German-speaking area, the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) shared with him on Friday. The Kühne Foundation promotes the project with EUR 12.5 million. From Switzerland the University of Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, is involved in the University Hospital Zurich.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are the major risk factors for heart disease. Genetic factors determine the risk with. But the interaction between genes and external influences is not known enough. Now scientists want to compare the total survival of 8,000 healthy people with the 1,000 patients of the University Heart and Fact Center at UKE.
Currently, in more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes, possible disease-producing changes in the DNA - so-called mutations - were known, it was reported by the clinic. Each year, about 200 more.
The objective of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiovascular disorders, heart disease and heart disease. The data could also be useful in the research of other public diseases, such as Stefan Blancenberg, Head of the University of Heart and Fever Centre. New knowledge of heart, heart and kidney interactions and cancer may also be possible.
The president of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed the firm's desire to use the data to investigate other diseases. The foundation clinic in Davos is currently dealing with allergies. Now a centre for Cardiovascular Precission Medicine will be established and a professor for bioinformatics will be created. In support of his commitment, the Swiss logistics firm said that he had been operating in Hamburg three years ago and was very grateful.
The biotests of healthy participants came from Hamburgers, who also participated in the Hamburg City Health Study. With 45,000 samples, according to the clinic, the largest local health study in the world will be the largest. At the reception key, the scientists assured the protection of the anonymous data. It is about a petabyte (1,000 terabytes) to data, Holger Moch of the University Hospital Zurich said.
A person's income can be resolved today according to UKE within 24 hours. The net cost of it is at 1300 euros. The first gene sequence worldwide, whose results have been published in 2001, has still cost hundreds of millions of euros. The study is to start on 1 October, by the end of 2020, all 9000 samples will be analysed. The first results will be expected in the year.
Nigerian Police Free Hundreds of Untreated Boys · Global Voices
In Nigeria, the police have released more than 300 wounded and abused boys from a Korean school. According to locals, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, as Yakubu Sabo reported. "The victims were mistreated. Some of them gave them to be raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys had been detained under the premeditated condition, taught in the Koran and "improved". Indeed, the defenders of their teachers were held under "the most disturbing and unmanaged conditions", said Sabo. About a hundred students, including children of nine years of age, had been caught in a small space.
The Corran school had been following the data for about ten years. The authorities had noticed repeated irregularities in the establishment. The parents had been shocked when they were informed of the status of the Corran school, said Sabo. They had not been affected by the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested by police.
In the vast Muslim north of Nigeria there are many private Korean schools. They replace the often lacking state facilities. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks of armed gangs. According to the UN refugee relief work, therefore, in the last ten months more than 40,000 people over the border in the neighboring state of Niger are flying.
Appointed and followed: Nigeria Police release 400 children from school
Police officers in a school in northern Nigeria have released nearly 400 students from solitary confinement. "Many of them had been arrested and some of them had seen injuries on the ground," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
There, the children were discovered on Thursday after an instruction in an Islamic school. The conditions there were "humanly". The officers took the school leader and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all young people, were held in their school as slaves and placed in chains. Some were sexually abused. TV images showed disabled and injured students in a estimable condition of health.
World Baller Selection: Further fronts by Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "No Signature"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe excellent
With a Gala in Milan, the World Football Verband Fifa draws out the best players, the best players and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi, it is the sixth honor and record.
After Nicaragua's captain explained that he had never voted for the World Football election, he was asked to join the Fifa. Egypt was not even valued - with a strong basis.
Many of the Fifa's proposals have proved encouraging in the past years: the WM donations, the double plans of its President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. The Fifa-World Baller election has not yet led to suspicion - if it is considered that the member's elected national trainers and national partners often vote in favour of sympathy.
However, after having already regretted Nicaragua's Captain, he had not voted in favour of any of the other things: Egypt regrets that the votes of National Trainer Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they did not appear in the official and public view of the vote.
Fifa regrets that "the signatures of the electoral forms have been issued in capital letters and therefore not valid". The Egyptian bond has been contacted several times in order to clarify the situation - without reply.
Sudan's trainer is also surprised
There is also an increase in the choice of the Sudan. While the situation in Egypt is satisfactory, the Sudanese connection suggests that trainer Zdravko Lugarisic did not agree as it was finalized: with Lionel Messi on one place, Virgil van Dijk on two and Saudi Mané on three. According to Fifa, the vote would be as final, with signatures and official stamps of the Sudanese Federation.
He also said: "Didn't agree with the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the information on my vote is false, thanks," he wrote. In his case it was suspected that the Nicaraguan football league simply voted in his name.
On Friday, the message came: vote, but of course it was not intended. The filled election records were "irrevergently" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan election, had been seen in a communication. However, he had actually chosen the second captain, Manuel Rosas. "We took responsibility for the administrative errors", he said in the communication. Both Rosas and the missionary trainer Henry Durtte had voted for Messiah, "as it is in the official list of the FIFA".
The other cases can now be examined by the Fifa in an investigation, but stressing that the selection process was monitored externally by the consulting company PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the winner of the World Football Election - and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the year.
Ukraine Affairs: Rankhohe Republicans speak for official investigation
Two high-ranked Republicans have spoken out for an official investigation against US presidents and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of the U.S. state Vermont, Phil Scott. "What it comes from here is determined by the facts that are determined." He wants to know more about the Whistblower case before measures are taken.
Scott said he was not surprised by the findings. He had shown that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate the activities of the democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine.
The Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump because of the Whistblower case, but few have recognized the disapproval. Scott's remarks are now a first sign of this in the Trump Party. The moderate governor of Virginia has already used politics against the Tromps policy, such as the closure of environmental protection regulations and the deterioration of immigration rules.
As another ranked Republican leader, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right approach and responsibility for the Congress is now to investigate the matter and to go on the basis of it."
Scott and Baker as governor of the United States formally did not speak in the proceedings against Trump, which will be decided at the Congress. Therefore, their statements are symbolicly important. However, the first senators of the Republicans have also said critical about the situation. In the meantime, with Romney, who destroyed the state of Utah in the second Chamber of Parliament, said the case was "extremely destructive and extremely destructive".
In the introduction of an official anti-terrorist procedure, the Democrats in the House of Representatives could have announced an investigation, and they would urge him to use force for foreign influence in their own political interests.
With the majority of the representatives of the House of Representatives, the Democrats could make such an impression. However, the decision on an actual representation was not in the Senate, where the majority of the Republicans had a majority. The prospects for such a procedure are therefore low. To date, no US President has been raised by an agency's impeachment procedure.
Were the folders on the board of rockets "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, they should have been raped and killed in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had been attacked by the ship rescuers "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board without permission from the port of Lampedusa. Following strong protests and international criticism - also by Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her homerest was restored after a few days by an Italian judge.
There are now new serious objections to rockets. So three men who are suspected of being subjected to torture in Libyan refugee camps, with the "Sea-Watch 3" arrived in Italy. The suspects have been arrested in a receptionist in Messina (Sicilia) after migrants had reconnaissanced their prisoners in Italy. "We can't exclude this, but we don't even have certain information about it," said the German press agency's spokesman Ruben Ruben.
It was reported by the police in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had been raped, raped, and even murdered. It was handled by Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and both Egypt Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically skiranted and exploited by repeated and persistent physical violence," it said.
NGOs and relief organizations now show that they can't know exactly who's coming on ships. "We can't scan who the people are. They come without passports," said Newman. Then be one of the main reasons why people fly from Libya. So it's probably that there are victims on the ships too. "That's why it's very important that it's going to happen".
Former Italian Minister of Interior Matteo Salvini asked for excuses against the aid of illegal immigration in Italy.
Musk executes delivery record at Tesla
Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has given his electric car company the view of new records of powered performance on the bridge.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published in the "Electrek" blog.
The demand was strong so that Tesla 110,000 orders could be booked, there were further written in Moscow. The challenge was to bring the cars to the customer. In addition, Tesla had to provide as many resources as possible for the quarter.
Investors found this: Teslas shares went with a plus of more than six percent of the trade. The course has been so strong for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered 95,000 cars well and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to reach his high goals. 2019 wants to deliver all 360,000 to 400,000 cars. In order to do this, six numbers will be needed in the current and coming quarter year. In particular, the most valuable Tesla Model 3 has been asked, but there are few gains. Despite the boom, there have been losses.
US budget dispute: only one bridge funding is needed
The new budget year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a regular budget. The Senate will follow the House of Representatives on Thursday, and has decided to finance the transition until 21 November.
Although the American Congress and President Donald Trump agreed to an increase in expenditure ceilings for the financial year 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again following a new fiscal year beginning on 1 October. The Senate has followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided to finance a transitional (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision it would have been a Saturday afternoon, a federal government ruling.
Shutdown refused
The Federal Government is currently being funded at the level and in line with the priorities of the expenditure plans for the final financial year of 2019. This is because the Congress has not been able to meet the 12-year rules of expenditure which can be allocated to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the Federal Government cannot first benefit from the additional expenditure framework for the new financial year from 1.3 billion to 1.4 billion.
The Democrats have produced ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have produced the majority, but the laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats who have little chance in the Senate of the Republicans.
The spirits differ in particular on the issue of resource distribution for domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans are trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the wall, one of the great priorities of President Trump. Democrats are opposed to the wall construction plans and their financing, which are actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The battle over the wall construction has already been rocked in December 2018 and has led to a 35-day Shutdown.
At the wall, the spirits are different
It is now unclear how the parties want to come close to this issue. Probably more than an agreement on all twelve expenditure laws in the coming seven weeks, it is an extension of the transitional financing beyond 21 November. Also, a Shutdown is not even excluded.
In view of the continuing inability of the Congress to adapt to the twelve rules of expenditure at the right time, and thus the imminent danger of a Shutdown to the process of automation to popularity. Proposal S. 1877 to prevent Shuttdowns would automatically continue the financing of the federal government at the previous year's level, to involve Parliamentarians' travel activities and retain their wages until the new annual expenditure plans are presented.
France permits artificial fertility for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertility is also to be revealed in the future: the Paris National Assembly agreed with a large majority for a legislative proposal by the Government that all women can claim an in-Vitro birth, so that the demand for anonymous sums should be made clear.
The proposal still needs the consent of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right place had warned that in the future many "children without a father" could grow. The French Bishop's Conference is also against innovation.
The new arrangement is the core component of a bioethics legislation, which Minister of Health Agnès Buzyn defended as "Cance" for society. It forms the modern family in which children are given only one parent or gay parents. The cost of artificial fertility for all women should be borne by the social insurance.
Fertility with sperm from dead husband continues to be prohibited
With a rather modest majority, the National Assembly has shown back an amendment that should give the white for an artificial fertility access to the sperm of her dead man. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, artificial fertility is permitted "post-mortem". In Germany, in the past, there were cases in which women complained about the release of the sperm of a deceased person.
On the other hand, several members of the government party La République en Marche (the Republic in motion, LREM) by President Emmanuel Macron and the opposition's members had spoken out for the artificial fertility with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a white woman would be released a "double trauma" if her husband's death still did not satisfy her child wish.
The sponsors of the proposed amendment are unjust to say that a White may be born with the sperm of an unknown but not with their own partner in the future.
To date, the artificial fertility in France is allowed only by heterosexual couples who cannot show their children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Busin had already announced in summer that the maternity is still prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertility is theoretically open to all women - for unmarried or lesbian couples, it is often difficult.
Climate balance: Call for flight allowance for units will be delayed
There are many refugees at the universities. That is why the country wants to make a climate contribution in the future. The rectors say they would have no money for it. But now they were also under pressure.
Schools should also be restricted when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Street debt
The discussion of a climate response to flights from universities and universities is again in progress. After the country sector conference has responded skeptically to an appropriate lead from the Green Black Coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctors of six Baden-Urtenberg universities and a pedagogical college for compensation for flights are "requiredly necessary", while there must be a broad debate on the prevention of flights in their opinion. The original CD has not been proposed in July.
Russia takes again North Korean fishermen
The FSB's secret service should have been illegal in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea had been caught. At that time, there was a shift between border guards and boat crew. Three Russians and a North Koreans were injured, the fisherman was later injured. This time, however, there were no injuries.
The Communist Republic of North Korea is under chronic food shortages. The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way to Russian waters of sovereignty. The coastal waters of Russia follow their own data to protect their marine resources patrols.
30,000 Tint fish caught
During the re-checks, 30,000 tint fish were discovered and caught on the boats. In addition, the data were collected after three fishermen and two motorboats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok.
Russia's Fisheries Authority also did not issue a prison licence to the North Koreans this year on charges of domestic entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been arrested since this year.
The head of the association of Russian fisheries companies in the primorje region, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained of high environmental damage by the North Korean fishermen. They were fishing with unmistakably synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also take small animals from the sea. Moreover, the nets would simply be taken into the sea, where they would need 200 years to be harvested.
In the future only 18.000: USA has low asylum thresholds
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police officers in the White House.
The richest country of the earth is looking at those who seek protection: As the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal training of refugees will be further reduced. In the future, there will be a threat to believers and Iraqi asylum.
The U.S. government wants to reduce the historically low threshold for the admission of new refugees. In the economic year 2020, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, the maximum of 18,000 people will be left in the country, as the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs has explained. In the recent economic year, the limit is still around 30,000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has severely reduced the recruitment of asylum seekers from all over the world in recent years.
The threshold of 18,000 refugees has been the lowest since the introduction of the US refugee programme in 1980. However, the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs has referred to it as "the most celebrated and most influential nation in history" as a form that remembers the use of the language of the former US Presidents.
A "responsibility-conscious approach" with refugees aims to enable refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild there, Trup explained. For his hard course in migration policy, he receives many demands from immigrants, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of dispute is the border to Mexico, which wants to open the trumpet. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had the national emergency. Whether there is a temporary link between the current measure and the current internal political developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure due to the Selenskyj procurement process and possibly a disturbing official control process.
The US Government wants to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future following an appearance from the Foreign Office: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are at risk, as reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On the contrary, 1500 refugees will be arrested from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The United States wants to achieve that, in particular, people from this "Northern Trieck" Central America are seeking asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has concluded with Guatemala and with El Salvador and Honduras migration agreements to reduce migration to Mexico.
Court ordered release of Orange-Utan from Zoo
An Orange-Outan-Weibchen was transferred from the former Argentine Justice Zoo of Buenos Aires to a reception station for people in the United States. The 1986 "Sandra" born in Rostocker Zoo was said to be the rights of a "non-human person" and therefore their release was forced. The animal was brought to Donnerstagend by direct flight to Dallas - however, not as a passenger, but in the frachtroom, as Professor Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilograms of heavy human oil are not able to adapt to life in the wild, they will live in the future at the center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other oranges and 31 chimpanzees, among which are "Bubbles", former petier of Popstar Michael Jackson. However, before entry into Florida, "Sandra" has to run a 40-day quarantine in Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the U.S. federal state of Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, Sandra spent several years in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before being transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 process of animal protection for "Sandras" has contributed to the transformation of Buenos Aires into an eco-park. By 2023 a research and education centre will be set up to receive the variety of species.
Record for Swiss Extremes: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The Dani Arnold's extreme mountain range in the Italian Alps has been blessed with a new home entrance at almost 3000 meters high.
Without a net, double ground or other means, the Swiss forced the 550 meters high north of the Great Wall in a new record time.
Dressed with Jeans, T-Shirt, and only supported by absolute speed freedom, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the rise. Thus he subsisted the old best brand for almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder at the Free Solo Speed at four of the six most important European North Walls.
Nicke benefited from new online marketing strategy
The US sports item manufacturer Nicke, despite the trade conflict with China, has bought a significant profit plus. The net profit rose to 1.4 billion dollars (about 1.3 billion euros) in the current quarter. This is 25 percent more than in the previous year's period as the group reported on the Tuesday. This is the reason for the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct" with which the Adidas competitor is online to its customers.
The sales rose to $10.7 billion by the end of August. The most powerful were the Nicke sales figures with a plus 22 percent in China. As a result, Beaverton's companies in the U.S. state of Oregon also benefited from its approach to users via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Financial director Andy Campion announced that with strategic investments, Nicke will continue to promote the "digital transformation" of the sport producer and thereby increase its competitive advantage. The applicants responded to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sport producer rose by more than five percent.
Lifelong Stadium ban on racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about the football profile Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the Union of the Italian capital has joined a life-long stadium ban against a fan. The defender Jesus from Brazil was defeated by the Fan on Instagram. Jesus published his private messages and asked his club to take action. "@officialasroma you already know what you should do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Stop being who I am", wrote the 28-year-old who has been playing at AS Rome since 2016.
The unit responded later on Thursday. He reported the account of the fan at Instagram and the police. Furthermore, the Roma agent could never visit a game of the union again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly scan racist fights against black player rivals. "We cannot have racism in society or sport. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. We must identify the responsible and remove from the stadiums," said Fifa President Gianni Infantino on Sunday.
The Italian authorities have now placed 38 randomizing fans of the Rector Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them should no longer attend the stadium for a period of ten years, the police shared with the others.
The fans are associated with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of Ultra fans in the area of Juventus. The twelve are led to severe repression, money laundering and private violence. The club had brought the findings with an announcement last year.
The Ultra managers are supposed to stick to Italian media reports after black trade with tickets. They would have "militaryly controlled" the ticket trade for the fancurve and should have forced Juventus employees to get on a cheaper map.
Generation Z: Are they really different than Generation Y?
Thousands of miles are narcissistic, the generation Z is politically - all year rounds are counted with graphic names. If you look more closely, the drawings are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the special feeling of young people's lives?
"The Krabs Come!" started with this call on 21 September officially at the Gucheng Sea in Gaochun, which also introduced the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Department for Public Works of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which is one of the national environmental zones in the province of Jiangsu. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has excellent ecological conditions with a mix of "30 per cent mountains, 20 per cent water areas and 50 per cent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
The people in Gaochun have already started the 1990s with the coal industry. Over the course of time, the coal industry has developed into a valuable sector that has contributed to high income and has become an important part of Gaochun's economic development. In recent years Gaochun has been active in the pursuit of a large, ecological and scientific development of coal mining as well as a technologically supported coal industry.
In recent years Gaochun has launched a reform to "distribute Power, Optimisation of Administration and Authority Services" and has carefully developed the service network for "acceptances under a roof, a criminal prosecution team, a network for services, a platform for credit transfer". In order to optimise the city's environment for authorisations, services and development.
Gaochun creates the advantages given above by connecting to the South Jiangsu and the South Angui, and uses the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as an indicator for intelligent high-end production companies, biomedicine and medical technology, energy conservation and environmental protection companies, from the cultural and health industry, and from the agricultural sector leading to the "3+2" sector. At the same time, Gaochun has contributed to the construction of a national, all-terminated tourism zone and from foreign modes as an international "slow city" to promote intelligent high-end production companies, cultural and environmental protection companies, from the cultural and environmental sectors leading to the "3+2" sector. At the same time, Gaochun's construction of a variety of tourism and transports from national sources has been contributed to the use of natural resources.
Conflict between Iran and the United States: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump protest
Iran's President Hassan Ruhani, after his return from the United States Volunteer Meeting, spoke of a alleged offer of sanctions to be lifted. The United States had made an end of all sanctions on its official website against Tehaner's leadership.
President Donald Trump, however, told Iranian officials about Twitter: "The Iranians wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed against him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the situation as follows: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and had insisted that a meeting be held. "And America says I have the sanctions," Ruhani added. The kind of criminal measures that should be put to end have been discussed. "And they have clearly said we have all sanctions."
However, if this precedent was not carried out in an acceptable manner, Ruhani was criticised. Given the criminal measures in force and "the atmosphere of the maximum pressure" no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel had met Ruhani in New York. In the background, the European hope of saving nuclear agreements with Russia and China was that the Islamic Republic would refrain from developing nuclear weapons. France's President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel at the end of the UN-volving assembly, expressed the hope that Ruhani would meet US President Donald Trump.
Heavy Earth Bees near Istanbul - Fast 200 After Bees
After the Western Turkey was hit within a short time by two earthquakes, fear grows in front of a catastrophe. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the storm on the morning, nearly 200 children have been killed, Turkish vice president Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for safety reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged. The earthquake of strength 5.8 on Thursday had hit the Marmara region before Istanbul and panicked in the millions of metropolis. Now the government wanted to set up a Commission to prepare the country better on land, declared Oktay.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for bees, Istanbul said Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the late danger is still ignored. Every year, poor housing houses are destroyed - among other things by the many smaller lands that are regularly threatened by Istanbul.
City planners such as the famous architect Mücella Yapici have been warning that large open areas that have been entered into the centre as asylum places have been built for years. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Kölcký bebens in August, the building room of Istanbul had warned that it estimated a million buildings in Istanbul would not be Earth-wide.
The epicenter of the bebeam from Donnerday was located in the Marmarameer in front of the village of Silivri and in about seven kilometers deep, as the disaster protection authority Afad announced. A smaller follow-up baby took place a few minutes later for even greater panic on the streets.
The Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was not first reported on Twitter with, injured or injured. The state-owned TRT showed people who fled panic in the homes. Students were brought in the Silivri district for safety reasons from the buildings. Some students refused to see images.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly threatened by land. Under the Marmarame, there is a section of the so-called North Atlantic disturbance marking the border between the Eurasian and Anatolic Earth. Turkey is once again threatened by earthquakes. One of the most deadly ones was the baby in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time, more than 17,000 people came to life.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of the strength of 7.1 to 7.4 could strike. However, when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear. At the earthquake on Thursday, it has already hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called go-bags with all the necessary items packed in addition to household controls, and schools help children to deal with when the earth wakes up. If the next big baby comes, it is unclear.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York, eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. The Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul disaster relief centre (Akom). Following that statement, two Minarates of Moscow entered the Avcilar and Sariyer regions.
Warning about post-births in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users reported panic. Buildings woke up. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. telephone lines were interrupted. It was more intense than the day of work, a user writes. The chief of the Turkish Red Halfmonds, Kerem Clinic, warned of the following. He called on the people to stay away from the buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The time of the bee is given official data at 13.59 (second time). Just a few minutes after the first bee, according to CNN Turkey, a follow-up bee was given with a strength of 4.0 on the direction scale.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of strength 4.6 struck the Turkish Marmara region - it was to be sprayed up to Istanbul. Its epicenter was also located in the Marmarameer in the west of the million metropolis, which the disaster protection authority Afad shared with the Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that provided for the fate of this service day: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers point out that it could have been a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul sooner or later - the tension between the tetanus plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will at some point cause damage - and massive damage.
Earth-based research circuit Ersoy calculates that the earth-beam is now a warning. It is more likely that this will make it easier to say to CNN Turkey. "This could be the signs of a larger earth-shade", says Ersoy to the sender. "In the past or later the big bee will also come."
A few weeks ago, there had been a crash - the baby was also very worried in Istanbul. In Albania it also had a severe earthquake just a few days ago - there were 68 injuries. This year the earth was also damaged.
Parliament: New Entrepreneur in Ukraine
Two broken documents provide for new material in the Ukrainian campaign for possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible official arrest procedure, the US Democrats are strengthened: The complaints made by an anonymous indicator about Trump and its conflicting telephone with the Ukrainian president raise important points of interest for investigations against the Presidents. Trup himself sees himself once more as a victim of a "hexenjagd". Moreover, he questioned the credibility of the Whistler's faith.
USA: Flights from United Airlines to Toilet - Flights to Airports
Since a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a flight from United Airlines was re-routed. The WC-Tur had been blocked during the flight from Washington to San Francisco in 1554, the airline shared with US media.
At an extraordinary interlocutory landing in the middle of the middle of the day, the woman was finally released from the cheap cabin. Once she had been locked in it for about an hour, US media were writing to other passengers. To continue the flight to San Francisco, the passengers had to change the machine.
In a video published on the Internet, which is supposed to come from the US media of flight 1554, it is to see how many people try to free the woman. "We are working at the moment to open the door, Ma'am.
The kakerlake: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit Chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unknown.
Inspired by Franz Kafkas famous story "The Conversion" the British Successor Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about the Brexit Chaos in Britain.
The novel "The Cockroach" (original: "The Cockroach") will appear in German on November 27, part of the Diogenes Verlag (Zürich). It is about the conversion of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or arrested in his former life, but now on one of the most powerful men in Britain. He sees it as his mission to implement the people's will in effect and is willing to let himself be held by nothing and nobody.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "When Parliament is closed so that the government can't be called out at a critical moment when the Soviet leader is lying as well as first the Soviet leader, if Brexitiers are in high positions just to repeat the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer needs to ask what he can do. There is only one answer: write it."
Kafkas 1915 first published story is by Gregor Samsa, who wakes up in the morning and sees himself "turned into an unbelievably rude person", after and after family and society, and finally goes on. "Ian McEwan bows before Kafka to describe a world that is headed," said Diogenes.
EU invests 9,5 million euros in Austria's railway infrastructure
11.200 cars in Austria and Hungary receive river brakes to reduce the noise pollution by freight trains. In addition, sections of the railway connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernized and electricalized.
This should make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions, as stated by the EU authority, and the funds come from the EU infrastructure summit "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All travel until 31 October
The German travel operator Thomas Cook said one day after his insolvency request that all flights should be cancelled until 31 October 2019. Travels may "not be taken for reasons of insolvency", the company said on Thursday.
This included bookings for the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Travel, ÖGER TOURS, Booker Travel and Air Marin, which are already paid or paid in full. The company opened on 1 November 2019. In accordance with the insolvency insurance, it will be examined further.
Thomas Cook, in Germany, was in the fall of the British parent company and had applied for insolvency on Wednesday. The company, including the Neckermann Travel, Öger Tours and Booker Travel, employs about 2,000 people in Germany.
Insurance wants to transfer to hotels from now on
However, since this Friday hotels abroad, which are currently hosting Thomas-Cook-Urler, are expected to receive money from the Zurich insurance. Payments to hotels are based on the condition that holidayers are no longer required for extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and no special invoices, the hotels in the holiday areas should now receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Turkish speaker of the German press agency said. "This applies immediately and provided that Thomas Cook visitors from these hotels are not immediately required or otherwise used for individual payment of hotel bills," said the speaker Bernd Engelien.
The insurance responded to reports of hotel guests who were forced to pay their accommodation on their own. Some then had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German travel association (DRV) and the federal association of the consumer centres had criticized this.
As many hotels are concerned, if the holiday is agreed with the insolvent travel provider, the insurance speaker said. According to the Thursday, 70,000 Thomas-Cook-Pauschallauler from Germany was still on the way. The Zurich Germany has secured Thomas-Cook customers' holiday and return.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
However, payments to hotels now announced by Zurich insurance help only travellers who are still on their way. For Thomas Cook customers who want to fly first in the holiday, it seems bad. On the late Thursday afternoon, the company shared that all travel would be cancelled until 31 October. This applies also to such bookings that have already been paid.
As is the case with starting on November 1, 2019, the company opened. In accordance with the insolvency insurance, the further procedures will be examined. In principle, the insurance is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel has been suspended. dpa
The company refers to the insurance policy that can be represented by the Kaera company. Customers could inform on the Kaera website about the possibility of reimbursing the travel price and apply their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroyed Springmine in Angola
Prince Harry has been leading Lady Diana's engagement for a long time. In Africa he is now moving directly to his mother's tracks.
The British Prince Harry in Angola, dressed in a blue splitter shield, has burned and destroyed a spring.
Near a campus of the British Halo Trusts at the site of Dirico, he set the south circle on Friday morning before running TV cameras. In a safe way, the explosive bodies in the savanna landscape operated without damage. Although alone, the halo Trust has destroyed more than 100,000 remains of the decade-old bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 mines that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African journey, Harry wanted to travel directly to Huambo City to the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same springmaster who accompanied his mother first, he wanted to return the way she went. The pictures on which Princess Diana 1997 went through a spacious mine field were going around the world. She also had support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day trip to Africa, which has begun in the South African tourist metropolis Capstadt.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: The risk of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated that he was not guaranteed a third uptake of Brexit negotiations, but what statements are already made in the polarising Britain from eternity. The latest court of the Supreme Court in the United Kingdom has moved like a damocle sword over the Blond Ship. Its suspension of Parliament to be able to hold its Brexit course until the date of exit was cancelled. Johnson, a law adopted by Parliament, has been obliged to effect a further extension of bilateral negotiations with the EU until 31 October.
Boris Johnson still holds Deal for possible
However, the pressure does not seem to go unnoticed by Johnson. In the meantime, he supported an extension of the negotiations in the event of an arrest by the end of October:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best with a deal, I'm careful optimistic that it hurts.
The time is generally spent with the Brexit dealers in Brussels. The EU and the British trader still have about six weeks to prevent an exit from Britain from the European Union without an agreement.
US Authority: Other deaths by e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has risen to twelve. In addition, between 805 confirmed and likely injuries in this connection, the U.S. Health Authority shared with CDC. A study in the "New England Journal of Medicine" found that more than 900 people were affected, some 500 of which have been confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still unclear. In Europe, there has been no similar increase in lung damage. The complaints appear to be limited to users in the United States.
Fear of New Protestants Growing in Egypt
Millions of videos were shared in online networks. The producer and actor living in Spain asks for a "popular revolution". For today's freeday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, whose critical corruption and mismanagement are against them. Ali hopes to compete with a million participants in central places in the country.
The security authorities have been alarmed at all times. In the centre of Cairo, there was already an enhanced police presence. Several U-road stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were closed. In the past days, the police had reinforced their road controls and the telephones of foot soldiers were partially searched for messages and photos in connection with the protests.
On 20 September the demonstrators also gathered around the Tahrir Square.
Last week there were protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. One such open protest had not been given in Egypt for years. The security forces responded accordingly. According to the Human Rights Watch (HRW) organization, almost 2,000 people have been arrested last week. Many of them have been arrested voluntarily - only because they were "in the wrong time at the wrong place", sharing HRW with legal prisoners.
The organization also criticisedzens in the North African country. Therefore, the government blockes Cairo websites and online services to block further protests against al-Sisi. The General governs the country since 2013, after defeating the democratically elected Islamic President Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Muslims, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been arrested and sentenced in the past years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs from Greenland expedition back
The Polar Researcher Arved Fuchs returned on Friday from his Greenland expedition. He was welcomed at his arrival in Hamburg port, among other things by the shipper Boris Herrmann, the climateist Greta Thunberg with the rennnnacht "Malija" on the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had studied and documented the effects of earthquakes on his ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coast of Iceland and Greenland over the past months.
The Fridays for Future Movement will be a blessing, said the Polar Researcher. He has been waiting for years for the young generation to report for word. It has been known for decades that the earth is hot. Nevertheless, many acted as if it were a planet B.
"What happens on the sea is often happening under the exception of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform the people about the effects of earth’s warming and the melting of the sea. When the expedition was measured, among other things, by a drop of green ice and was fished by microplastic networks.
For his "fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the world sea," the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seedevcon Maritime Award" in Hamburg. "For all of us who survive the oceans in the heart, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said shipper Boris Herrmann in the award. "It is a witness of the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in recent decades".
Treasure spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid for rents 430 Euro
430 Euro for two Teller Spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near Engelsburg in Rome: It seemed to be too much for two Japanese tourists. The bill included 80 euros of drinking money paid by the two women, but they posted the quit on Facebook, which triggered today's reactions.
"These cases are harmful to Rome's view. We call on the police to ask whether it is a fraud here," asked a speaker from Federagit, who called for the link between the leader of the journey in Rome according to the Roman daily Il Messaggro.
Immediately the reaction of the owner of the restaurant came. The Japanese had not only spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner had justified himself. However, this is not to be taken out of the account. Also, a drink of up to 20 percent of the account was normal, meaning the host price.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is busy? U.S. President Donald Trump could actually be faced with an official arrest procedure after the turbulent events of the past day, which the Democrats want to examine with their investigation at the representative's house as quickly as possible - the speech is from weeks until a decision is made.
At the beginning of the scandal, the phone with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensskyj is somewhat different. The subject of the Whistler, who has been concerned about national security and the democracy of the United States with his last complaint, is shocking: the President has abused his office's power to instrumentalize the government of another country's decision on the election of 2020. He has used Ukraine's dependence to pressure them into becoming active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be completed in the document published in the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not repeat the full sentence. The telephone from July 25 is only an episode of a much larger story, in whose centre next to Trump is his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
The story takes from the public's perspective in May 2019 when the New York Times of Rudy Giulianis reported travel plans in Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the President-elect Selensky, and the lawyer knows himself very well that his views are wrong. "We don't get into a choice, we mix us into an investigation which we have the right," he says. One might think it is inappropriate but "it's not illegal." Giuliani wants that there is no basis for this information in Ukraine - "because it is very helpful for my clients and it is helpful for my government".
The lawyer and former mayor of New York appear to have been infected with the right anti-candidatian anti-candidatin in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had been conceived with actors in Ukraine, critics at the time said to build an opportunity for Russian media in the USA. However, this project was never serious.
This is precisely what the trumpet is said about in July on the telephone with Selenskyj. The version of Giulianis and the president says: The former Vice-President and now prominent candidates for the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, have been pressured by the Ukrainian government to release the Ukrainian government's then General Public Service Wiktor Schokin. Although, in order to stop the investigation of the gas company, his son Hunter Biden was active in his supervisory board, the former vice president and the prospective candidate for the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, the Ukrainian official of the Ukrainian government, has been working on the release of the Ukrainian government.
In fact, the execution was something different. When Joe Biden asked that the Ukrainian General State lawyer should go, the investigations against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden had never been directly affected by them.
Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users around the world report massive disturbances on Instagram and Facebook. This is why Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain are particularly affected. On the website allassungen.de users report that Facebook has not been invited again since about 15.30 hours. Instagram also reports the error message that content could not be loaded. Also, whatsapp seems to be affected by the disturbance, although not yet in the same range.
Instagram and Co.
It's not the first massive crash this year. Already in March and July, services have been out for several hours. And, as in previous cases, users also come back on Twitter this time, especially to make their carefree air.
Polish scientists saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued from the Chilean aircraft from the Antarctic ice. They were on their way with a shooting boat and several miles away from their base than their engine had failed. They had been lucky in the accident - less than an hour, the Chilean rescue crewer needed the landing.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Force:
"At 9:30 we received the message that we were started just before ten, and good 20 minutes later we were over the rescue boat."
Poland has been working at King George Island since 1977, Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctica Station, where 19 scientists are working. The frozen researchers have certainly been returned to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NIE wireless download
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used yet.
As recently as several new smartphones have come to the market, which support wireless charging and sell very well - all in front of the new iPhone-11 models, we want to call a study from the beginning of July to remember. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
High temperature set to battery
Researchers warn against cableless loading of smartphones. This is according to the findings of the University of Warwick, which is extremely dangerous for the devices. For this reason, it is the significantly larger heat development. If a normal phone per cable is set up, the battery is built up in three hours at 27 degrees. When cableless uploads the researchers have measured themselves at the perfect direction of the smartphone on the upload.
Capacity and time of life
According to the researchers, the temperature for the sustainability of Akkus is a decisive factor. Then each degree plays a role. When loading with higher temperatures, the battery is not only limited to capacity, but it also does not last as long as it is. So life is less than that. Researchers are therefore advised to load the smartphone regularly per cable. Since an accomous watch is always connected with high costs of modern smartphones, it should be a helpful tip. Apple has finally increased the cost of an actuistic watch even once for all iPhones.
Practical
The technique is extremely convenient: Simply place the device on an appropriate charging pad - they are already already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery will be loaded without a light cable salad and heavy steel. Since Qi (is a global standard for inductive energy transmission), with the exception of Apple, there are few restrictions. However, the technology should be used only in exceptional cases.
Everest-Stau Photographer: 13 eight thousand in six months
A Nepalese mountain climber, according to his own data, has only six months 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the peak of the Manaslu in Nepal and thus has a record shared with his expedition organizers.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 thousand in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international hits: a photo of mountain climbers who are on Mount Everest Schlange in the morning.
The picture of the mass-and-angered range was resolved by a debate on stronger security measures at the 8848 metres high mountains and the highest peaks of the earth. In May, 11 climbers died during the siege within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the increase of the 14th millennium: currently the Chinese authorities stop the Xixabanma mountain in Tibet. As a reason it is called under the worst weather. In the beginning of the week Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wants to speak with China to enable him to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered on Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a brave elephant who shared a police speaker on Friday with him. "We suspected the elephant had been killed."
The four Kadavers were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists to the former Sigiriya. The animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old, and an autopsy was arranged to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed each year. The targets are often farmers whose animals had been kept harmlessly in their country. At the same time, about 50 people of elephants are killed each year. This usually happens when animals move around their habitats.
There are only about 7,000 elephants living in Sri Lanka. At their execution, the death penalty is theoretical.
British oil tankers are leaving Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after his arrest by Iran. This was announced by the Irish news agency IRNA. The Iranian Revolutionary Gardens had established the tanks running under the British flag on July 19th under the pretext of violating the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in the Critics
The competent Economic Committee of the Underhausen wants to examine the board of travel agent Thomas Cook. It is also about the board's budgets as well as the question of why the British Government could not contribute financially to the survival of companies. "Our interest is also the company's supervision as well as the control by external book inspectors," the Committee president Rachel Reeves told London. "We have a bad example of management".
According to experts, genetics are overestimated at the risk of breast cancer
The role of the gene in raising the risk of breast cancer in the family has already been overestimated. To this end, researchers from the German Kreb Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg arrive in a current study. Other risk factors such as family eating habits are likely to be more difficult than ever. This has had consequences for calculation of the individual risk of breast cancer, stressing the DKFZ scientists.
Elon Musk is reading Tesla-Actions rising
This was written by Musk in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (the second time) from the "Electrek" industry blog. The demand was strong so that Tesla 110'000 orders could be booked, as it continued in Mussk's rounds.
The challenge is to bring the cars to the customer. Tesla must provide as many resources as possible.
In the second quarter, Tesla provided 95'000 cars with a plus of more than six percent of the trade. The course has not been available for nearly four months. Tesla had delivered 95'000 cars in the second quarter and thus achieved its best value.
Musk needs records to reach his high goals. 2019 wants to deliver 360'000 to 400'000 cars as a whole. In order to do this, in the current and coming quarter year, six-digit numbers are needed. In particular, the most expensive Tesla Model 3 has been asked, but here are few gains. Despite the last loss of the tree.
Will the British government change Brexit law? Johnson retreating
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he is looking for an unregulated Brexit law on the basis of the possibility of a change in Parliament's law. On a question, he simply said on Friday before journalists, his Government will be subject to applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must apply for a derogation from the exit term, should not have reached an agreement with the EU until mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law", which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political scans" to change the law.
Johnson said he was seeking an agreement with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement".
Iran's apparently running up-to-date uranium production
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on the European Contracting Parties in the fight against the salvation of the historic atomic convention. "It is sad that the European States are unable or unwilling to take concrete action," Rohani said on Thursday at a press conference at the end of the UN General Assembly in New York. To ensure that they do not agree with their agreements, he took "more steps" in view of the agreements of the 2015 that had been negotiated.
The conflict is about the international agreement to prevent an Iranian atom bomb, which, as a consequence, includes the commitment to normalize the economic relations. The US rises out of the agreement in 2018 alone to force Iran with "maximum pressure" to change its policy of aggressiveness. The Government of President Donald Trump wants to negotiate a new agreement with stricter sanctions against Tehran.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using or at least preparing for use with Uran in early September. Iran also prepares for the construction of more than 300 additional centrifuge.
Perhaps the Europeans were not ready to take their share of the deal and therefore left Iran alone with the costs and burdens of pressing US sanctions, Rohani would have had to do so. Nevertheless, further discussions will be held that would hopefully bring a solution.
Rohani continues to pursue Iran's development in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, following an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed the US assessment that Teheran was responsible for the attack. Initially, the Huthi rebels supported the attack in Yemen, however, were aware of what the United States was perceived as false. "We have nothing to do with this," Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who raise such accusations must prove it," said Rohani. However, the European leaders had not been able to speak with him during the UN general debate. Instead, they had only claimed that the rebellions in Yemen could not have taken place as they did. Rohani had met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the past days.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, the extensive sanctions of the US administration had to be lifted first, Rohani demanded that the government in Washington shift to a policy of dialogue and rationality.
From other stars across the solar system
Astronomers have now observed a comet from the depths of the world. This has been achieved only once. The comet can turn back on other solar systems.
What was once just a doubt is now confirmed: an interstellar guest is surrounded by our solar system. The comet from the depths of the world was baptized after his discovery on 2I/Borisov and increased the interest of astronomers throughout the world.
The widest comet was discovered on August 30th by the Amateurstrone Gennadi Borissow at the Margo observatory on the Crime - with a self-constructed telescope of 65 cm diameter. The observation of various observatories not only confirmed that it is a comet that is unknown, but also showed that it is not from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is the second interstellar object to be seen after 1I/'Oumumaa from 2017.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get close views in a foreign solar system before it can be seen. Firstly, it shows that the interstellar comet is similar to our own system as the Canadian astrophysicical Institute reported. "The current speed of the comet is high, approximately 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is significantly above the typical speeds of objects surrounding the sun," reports David Farnocchia from the US space authority Nasa in a communication.
The comet is following the analysis of a so-called hyperbelt path that runs it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin as reported by the International Astronomy Union (IAU). It is also responsible for the designation and classification of celestial bodies. In honor of its discovery, the interstellar Swiss stars, which were first introduced under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, named 2I/Borisov, indicate that the first part of the name is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers have been lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuumaa, 2I/Borisov has already been on the move. Thus, researchers remain for months of research. "The object will be able to achieve the greatest light by mid-December and then until April 2020 with medium-sized telescopes", explained Farnocchia. "It will only be observed by October 2020 with even greater professional telescopes".
Several observers have already taken visitors into the audience. Thus a team of Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, which has already led to the characterization of 1I/'Oumumaa, in a first survey of the diameter of the sky object at 2 to 16 kilometers. The recording of the Gemini observatory on Hawaii shows a significant shift of the comet.
Researchers and researchers from the Canadian Astrophysicical Institute (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar Swiss, which offers a type of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object resembles comets of our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar," reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation is easy to see that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in ours, complemented by the Leóns College Javier Licandro.
The discovery of the same two interstellar visitors within just two years after the IAU's evaluation indicates that these objects could open up a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, as often as such visits are, it is still difficult to assess. One of the next interstellar visitors may be able to start a planned satellite mission by the European Space Agency Esa.
By 2028, the Agency wants to station the three-way zone "Comet Interceptor" (German about comets) on a waiting position in 1.5 million kilometres from the earth. According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, it is expected that you will be able to run on a new, fresh comet from our own solar system or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Oumumaa.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega Airport Daxing
Right before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, it is as follows: On the new Mega Airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger machine of the China United Airlines is landing, a special honor for Captains and Crew.
By 2022, about 45 million air guests were to be aired annually, and 2025 it was already 72 million. China President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-dollar project. China's most recent loan project is also called "seas" because of its six-star building structure.
The complex has four starting and landing routes to be extended to seven later and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new U-new U-road transports passengers in just 20 minutes to the city of Beijing.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had been able to learn from Beijing several times. The opening of the building since 2006 - and significantly smaller - main airport in Germany has been relocated. In Beijing, however, after four years, a first passenger machine was established.
New trans-shipment aircraft is to fly 2030: In four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - the UK Space Agency is dreaming of it. It is possible for these, who, for the 2030s-year-old flight, will have a special drive (Synergetic Air-Braything Rocket Engine, Sabre), developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, the US-Sender CNN invited the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely be achieved," said Agent Graham Turnock to the sender. "We are talking about the 2030s to the company, and the work has been very advanced."
To advance the project, the British Space Agency wants to cooperate with the Australian more. A flight from the British capital to the Australian Metropolis is currently about 20 hours away. As a single passenger trans-shipment aircraft from 1976 to the establishment of its 2003 operation, the New York-Paris route covered three to three and a half hours. In 2000, there was an accident at the start of a contract at the Paris airport of Charles de Gaulle, where all 109 passengers came to life. In the last year, Martin Plane was known as a single passenger trans-shipmenter.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes Reaction Enginees, among other things on his home page. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient journeys with a speed of March 5 - which means five times as fast as the shell. In addition, such aircraft are also usable outside the Earth's atmosphere and enable the "next generation of re-useable frames".
Upgrading in Washington: Trump wants anonymous tipper in Ukraine-Affère
In the Ukrainian campaign on possible abuse of power by the US President Donald Trump wants to raise potential prominent positions in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the Whistleblower the information," said Trup on Thursday before the United States mission staff in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and had in the past "a little different" as today.
This was assessed as an intrusion test against the tipper. The event was not actually public. However, several US media distributed audio media on Friday. Democrats responded to the president's statement.
On Tuesday, the Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives announced preparations for an official anti-trump procedure. Their proposals are based primarily on the written complaint of an anonymous secret servant, the heavy charges against Trump and its government headquarters.
As part of his work, the Whistblower wants to receive information from several government staff, where the US President "uses his office" to achieve the goal of joining another country in the US election 2020.
At the center of the front row is a controversial telephone between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj Ende July, in which Trup encouraged his colleagues to investigate that might damage his political rival Joe Biden. This is about former business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and his alleged efforts to protect his fresco against Ukrainian justice.
The Whistblower accused the White House of looking at the Ukrainian telephone also of the confusion: Chief government staff had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under cover. As was usually an electronic dictionary protocol, this was done after the interview with lawyers from the White House, but was removed from a database normally intended for it and was kept in a special protection system.
The identity of the indicator is not public. "New York Times" reported that it was supposed to be a member of the CIA's foreign secret service.
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets, the president wrote on the subject, among other things, the "so-called Whistbler" had spread information in a second hand that had appeared inappropriately.
How Trup reacted to those outside who were supposed to have access to the Whistblower information, however, came to an end. The president of the U.S. representative House, Nancy Pelosi, reacted and complained that Trump's statement was one more attempting to break the government's integrity.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations have been carried out for several months in various committees against Trump and its environment. In the face of Ukraine's prejudices, the Democrats are now moving forward with renewed momentum in order to put in place a possible anti-tump procedure.
"The Whistblower has given us a driving plan for our investigation," said the Chief of the Secret Service Committee at the representative's house, Adam Ship.
More than 300 former U.S. government staff from the security and external policy area, who were mostly involved in democratic but also in republican presidents, made a statement published on Friday following the investigation by the Democrats for a possible arrest procedure.
With the majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats may insist on a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on an actual official accession falls in the Senate where the majority of the Republicans have a majority. The prospects for such a procedure are therefore low, so far no US President has been raised by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW Business Council: Workplaces are built "bad"
The VW brand plans to further reduce the cost of production in Germany and Europe could be carried out. This concerns the Autobuilder's business council. The brand wants to reduce its annual manufacturing costs from ten billion euros to two billion euros by 2023.
A key to this is the staff costs. The "Education Package" negotiated between companies and the Business Council by 2020 is already available for the construction of 14,000 jobs alone in Germany. In principle, a job can only be built on the car grower if it is almost proved that the related activities are no longer needed. In addition, employment insurance applies until 2029.
However, as our newspaper now comes from business circles, jobs in the production that are not actually available are "bad" built on another way - so the official course would not be repeated.
In these cases, the Board of Directors has no opportunity to force re-employment. In the meantime, many staff lack the employment coverage to increase the concerns before a general breakdown of vehicles. This also increases the fear that vehicle production could be withdrawn from and from Germany and Europe because it is more expensive in other parts of the world.
The brand VW wants to standardize production worldwide and control new central projects. It is also necessary to reduce costs and accelerate decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and competitiveness. Production president Andreas Tostmann said at a management conference in Berlin: "We are well advised in times of uncertainty from the Brexit to the current trade war between the United States and China."
In this way it has already been successful: for example, in this year the cost of production would be lower than in the previous year since 2013. Tostmann told reporters that the production time for the golf 8, which was to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, would be reduced by 1.1 hours.
20 hours.
In our region, Wolfsburg is the only VW factory produced in the vehicle. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter works produce components. For Wolfsburg VW interior, the railway line is used to build 800,000 cars per year so that the work is profitable. 2018, however, in Wolfsburg, only about 700,000 vehicles were loaded - provided by the sensitive diesel demand and the problems of the conversion to the new use and waste gas test WLTP.
As Tostmann announced last year, however, in Wolfsburg, "perspectively", a million cars are to be played by the band. This should enable the bonding of the golf production in the factory - because Zwickau works by refurbishing to the location for the e-Autoproduction.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently evolved. Therefore, the expectations are now resting on the golf 8.
With Voodoo forced to prostitution: Dealer sentenced
Young women from Nigeria have been beaten with tears, thrown into the noise zone and forced to prostitution. Six men must be sent to prison.
Six potential human dealers from Nigeria were sentenced to eight years and three months in prison on Friday in Bochum to be sentenced to eight years' imprisonment. The defendants had locked young women from Nigeria into the riot zone and forced them to prostitution. To enforce their obedience, the visiting Nigerians still had to put a ritual in front of a Voodo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years of age. They were brought with the help of Libyan lockers on board ships across the Mediterranean. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. In Germany, they were distributed on various boards to work out the corresponding key costs of an average of EUR 25,000.
The defendants - four men and two women - had given the closing and subsequent distribution of young Nigerians to boards in the process. "The work made women physically and psychologically difficult," said Justice Isabel Hoffmann in the hearing. "Some were right-minded".
The judgments are based on commercial and banditarian closures of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, ageing and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo requires negotiations with Airthansa
FIm Long-term conflict with the Lufthansa Group has again threatened the Ufo flight co-operation with strikes.
If the company is not to return to the negotiation process, the company will " inform the LH Group on 14 October" of the work plan," Ufo's tariff president, Daniel Florer, told him on Friday. He and his daughter Eurowings have been starting to negotiate with Ufo for months.
In this point, Ufo is now in favour of a decision of the Court of Labour in Frankfurt. Airthansa wanted to establish that the tariff agreements were not announced. The court showed the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined the decision against it. "That a second court sees the whole thing differently, I think it is unlikely," said Ufo-Vlor.
In August, Lufthansa had also submitted an application to the Frankfurt Court of State for a judicial review of the status of Ufo as a company. The company argued that the company had not used a representative board for months and was therefore unable to fulfil its role as a tariff partner.
In the past, there was a strong leadership struggle in the apartheid industry, in which several members of the board and the Beirath, including the long-term trade union chief Nicole Baublies, had already voted against the cabinet staff at Eurowings End July because of their doubts about their leadership.
Easy entry: Saudi Arabia announces new Visa system on
So far Saudi Arabia has not just been known as the international tourist magnet, but it is about to change. The country in the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visas.
With a new Visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the number of international and domestic visitors increased to 100 million per year, the tourism commission shared with.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia for international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said the president of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia is still difficult to access for tourists. Visitors usually only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with members of the Western state. With the new rules, the preconservative Kingdom expects more revenue from the tourism business. After its own appearance, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the largest oil refinery in the country in Abkhaik and the oil field of Churais. This resulted in the dramatic rise in national oil production, the oil prices in the height. It may take several weeks until the oil production of the Kingdom once again reached its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber stick in preparations for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos on Thursday (the second time) in their Instagram stories on which they are to see the wedding day. Reality-Star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized the People's magazine following a young cell decision in Los Angeles.
Justin posted several poems, including those printed with bananas, on Instagram and said to his followers: "Help me to choose my jewelry." Media reports indicate that the promi couple wanted to marry church during the coming week.
A year ago, the bees gave the word yes in a New York office. A larger party had not given it at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that the two found a common level after initial problems: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't make a relationship".
Two deaths in Chechnya
Two people came to life when a small plane crashed into the West Chechnya. The quake was discovered on Friday in a forest area in the city of Mecin (Metschin), the police shared with them. At death, a 38-year-old woman and 64-year-old man were killed.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday afternoon after the arrival of the GPS. In the search there was also a military bomber in use. The accident has yet to be identified. It is located about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (pilsen) and 100 kilometers north of Regensburg.
Half of the European tree species are threatened by extinction
In addition to damages, diseases in the region, non-sustainable forest species, and the growth of the cities caused threats, the IUCN World Protection Zone reported on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the existence of 454 trees known in Europe. 265 of them are not present on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent have been threatened. 66 have already been at the highest level of threat and thus before extinction.
The IUCN shares endangered species in six categories: from "potentially endangered" over "hauled", "highly endangered", "dangerous from extinction" and "lost in nature" to "missed". Overall, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide as being endangered.
Aberian and Wild Russian Threatened
In Germany, particularly in the Hebrew (Sorbus), one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency, said: "Most of them are threatened because the populations are so small as they are, or because of the conversion or weakness of their habitats."
It also looks bad for the wild habit of Russia. It has been considered "dangerous", stage two of the IUCN scale since 2017. The biggest threat is the Balkan Mining Mussel in addition to a pillar. Since the 1980s, it has spread across the whole continent and has almost natural enemies. The IUCN estimates the number of wild Russians (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 copies. The trees in cities, parks and Allies are not taken into account in this assessment.
Strawberries and moose also in danger
At the same time, the IUCN scientists created new European Red Lists for Meats, Forests and Moose. More than a fifth of the soft animals and moose and almost half of all species of moose have been threatened, the IUCN. This is especially at the destruction of forests, associated species, agricultural practices and climate change. Meats such as bees played a key role in recycling nutrients in the soil and are an important food source for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the location of many superior and underestimated species is predominate, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, the IUCN director of the European Office. "We must limit man's effects on our ecosystems and give priority to the protection of these species".
Groundnuts before Istanbul: 34 reported injuries
34 people were injured during the recent earthquake in Turkey. Death was not reported. Thousands of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for safety reasons, Turkish vice president Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were subsequently damaged. Since the spring of the morning, there have been nearly 200 children. The earthquake of the strength of 5.8 on Thursday had destroyed the Marmar region before Istanbul and eliminated panic in the millions of metropolis.
Now the government wants to set up a Commission to prepare the country better on soils in the future, declared Oktay. In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for bees, Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said.
Istanbul is particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea there is a section of the so-called North-East Atlantic disturbance marking the border between the Eurasian and Anatol disc.
One of the hardest bees was one of the 7.6 strengths in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Gölckýk in southeastern Istanbul. More than 17,000 people came back to life.
Already on Tuesday, a wave of strength 4.6 had hit the region around Istanbul. The authorities called on the inhabitants to continue the damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (Jlo) and Shakira take part in the semi-time show
The Latin pop singer Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will perform the half-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl. That gave the singers known on Twitter. "greater will not be it," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She was prepared to stand on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be as far as Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that since 1996, she's been surprised to be at Super Bowl - at the time she's seen Diana Ross flying in the middle of the show in heaven. "It's even more special now because the NFL is 100 years old and I'm going to be perfect with another Latina." You can hardly expect "to show what we girls can do at the largest stage of the world".
Shakira showed in a statement that she felt ashamed to be in addition to another artist at one of the largest stages of the world and to represent Latinos and Latinos from the United States and the whole world. "And then also on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter, it was the first time that the two "kings" were together on a stage.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fight against sensitive numbers of visitors
The Super Bowl is the highest point of the American football season. The game and half-time show are among the most popular TV broadcasts in the United States. Even though you've had the latest number of visits, in February, the spectrum in the United States has been attracting the least audiences for more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still nearly a hundred million people in the range.
About the half-time show of the past Super Bowl had given up in advance: In the struggle to deal with Quarterback Colin Kaapernick, topstars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not appear in the previous February media reports. Finally, the Maraon 5 pop group conducted half-time shows - the critics were less friendly.
Kaapernick, then quarterback of San Francisco 49ers, was in 2016/17 before NFL games in protest against police violence and racism at the national stage. With his protest, Kaapernick dissolved a movement, and many players took over the gesture. This led to a great surprise, US President Donald Trump attacked most African football stars. Kaapernick himself has been unarmed since March 2017 and has no longer fought a NFL party. He wants to stop him for political reasons.
Cook Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance
Some banks may prefer the company's travel provider Thomas Cook based on a press report. There are high discounts on outstanding loans and loans. This is also the case with credit Switzerland, writing the "Financial Times" in their release from Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or the Credit Suisse may have to carry out a total of up to 1.8 billion British funds (about EUR 2 billion) on their books.
The creditors of loans had to take out from 900 million to 1 billion dollars and the creditors between 550 and 825 million dollars. The amounts actually written should be higher at the top of the bonds, said one expert to the sheet.
How great the loss of believers at the end will be shown after the insolvency process is over. A procedure near the person is not promising too much hope. For example, about 40 vehicles from Thomas Cook in the United Kingdom are "alive" and many of the properties are in bad conditions. Most of the money could probably be stolen with the sale of airport slots and the brand Thomas Cook.
Rocket should have brought potential killers to Italy.
Seawatch Captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who were supposed to have persecuted and tortured in Libya. "We can't exclude this, but we don't have any sure information about it," said the spokesman of the Seawatch refugee organization, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants had re-known the three men in Italy. They were told to be raped, tortured, and killed in Libya. The potential perpetrators were arrested in the host of the Italian Messina. New farmers emphasized that refugee organisations could not verify who they were on their ships. "They come without passports".
Carola Rackete had brought illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa on June 29th and had a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects should also be there.
U.S. Federal Government warns before Huawei
The Head of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the Federal Government to trust the Chinese network operator Huawei.
We believe the risks are too high," said Pai to the "handling sheet" with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law", which each company has committed "under Chinese law" to follow the instructions of the security authorities.
The applicable law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," the FCC chief continues. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has agreed, inter alia, to request from suppliers, "a declaration of reliability".
Berlin wants to first try to control the risks, such as technical solutions, to report the "handling sheet" on its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not exist only from hardware:
Just the software is important to keep the devices on the latest position. This software consists of billions of lines of code that change over time," said Pai.
It is "very difficult to imagine", that a government authority, "no matter where possible, would be able to verify every particular update in real time to address security risks", the FCC chief continues.
The Chinese Group Huawei makes close contacts with the Chinese State Department:
The relationship of ownership is remarkable, and the company of employees that the company is about to belong is not independent of the government," Father said to the "handling sheet".
The U.S. reported that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to acquire the position of the US.
Chemistry factory in North France: Schools closed
In the night, residents hear explosions. A giant firewall lights the sky over a northern French chemical factory. The fire has been destroyed after hours - the heating works can last for days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and children were closed in the region.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not be open on Friday, the competent Prefecture shared with them. The Ministry of the Interior had urged the citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not to smoke.
The fire could be completely removed on Thursday afternoon, as the Prefecture reported. There is still the risk that after the removal of the force, the Prefecture was spread on Twitter. According to the Prefecture, 240 firemen and 90 police officers and gendarmes were used at Brandort.
A giant black smoke oil was first produced from the chemical industry. French media reported huge flame and explosions in the company’s product of Lubrizol, which produces the additional oil. The production facility is a few kilometers away from the city center.
The factory in Normandy belongs to authorities in the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites, which are particularly monitored. In the Italian Seveso in Milan, it was a devastating chemical accident in 1976.
The president of the region of Normandy, Pierre-André Durand, told the messenger BFMTV that there was no "high toxicity" in samples at first. However, a pollution of His nearby sites could not be excluded. In the river were cities against pollution, the Prefecture explained.
The fire broke out early in the morning at 02.40 hours, the authorities reported. The reason remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional Metropolis and lies between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Minister of Finance: "Germany must invest and now"
The French Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs Bruno Le Maire has called for Germany to invest more in order to boost economic growth in the euro area.
Germany needs to invest and now, better than ever,," said Le Maire on Thursday at the French budget presentation for the coming year.
The economy in the euro area is weak, the Minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation deteriorates in order to make the necessary decisions."
These countries, which had had budget spaces for more investment, had to deal with Le Maire, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France did not have these toys, the minister added and pointed to the country's high debt, which is more than 98 per cent of gross domestic product. The French debt must be "stabilised" and "reduced", said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly called on Germany to carry out more public investment in order to survive the European economy.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, represents tax relief of more than nine billion euros for households.
The French Government therefore reacts, inter alia, to the protests of the wave movement. The new debt should fall to 2.2 per cent, after expected 3.1 per cent this year.
Is he still trying to pull?: Johnson weighs question about Brexit tactics out
British Prime Minister Johnson criticises the "capitulation law" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament is back to writing a law to the British Prime Minister to avoid a Chaos-Brexit. Critics feared that Boris Johnson could still use a fight.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he wants to pass on an irregular Brexit - despite the last of Parliament's legislation, which is to prevent it.
The law provides that the government must apply for a derogation from the exit term, that no agreement should be reached with the EU until mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law", which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
The former British Prime Minister, John Major, had said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political scans" to change the law. The Prime Minister could adopt a procedure that would move the law into force on time after the EU strike. Johnson said he was seeking a contract with the European Union. "We are confident that the EU will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement".
Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings explained below that he felt the political austerity of Brexit as a "space walk in the park" and was confident that the intended EU Austria was still in possession: "We enjoy what we will win, we will (e.g. Red: from the EU), no worry," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" following a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the EU referendum 2016, now serves as the chief strategist at Downing Street British government headquarters. He is going to step behind the compromiseless policy that has led the prime minister into a tragic situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - all of them stood in front of Linda McCartney's camera, which has become one of the biggest rock photographs. But it must not always be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (boxes) is deeply rooted in the entire private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to Linda's death in 1998, was obviously proud and excited when he presented the image band "The Polaroid Diaries" in September in Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
After the launch event McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a flight in the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of the imagination of LindaMcCartney as an engaged artist and of the so-called "polaroid film."
At Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona, until she found the photograph, the camera was always there. Thousands of polaroids have made it, a few hundred of which are now first published in "The Polaroid Diaries".
There are portraits, styles, landscapes, several hamsters, a creature in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his preface. And of course, there is still one in the middle: Your husband Paul - as you may have never seen him before.
There he dances with his daughter Mary on the stairs, telephones in the bathroom with a doll on his head or wears unfavourable moonboats. Surely, McCartneys was an extraordinary family, but it was not always at the McCartneys' farm in South England or Scotland.
How hardly any other medium does the Poloraid camera start at the immediate moment. The recordings of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than pure scratches.
It's about the right click: You have to recognize if you have a great photo before you. And then you have to cut it at the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you cut it two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different picture." And Linda had the gift, always at the right moment. "She knew it was easy," said Paul in the Eshun-Essay.
The light, the composition, the image section, and the colors that "The Polaroid Diaries" makes not only a lasting picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure for all anecdotics, where landscapes have already become abstract images. The perfect addition to the newly released Beatles album "Abbey Road", which appeared just 50 years ago.
"We're going to buy more oil and gas from Iran"
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not break the oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our gas from there," Erdogan said in New York, where he had participated in the UN Volt Assembly.
However, it was argued that Turkey had problems with imports of Iranian soil oil, as some companies had "reduced back because of the US pressures".
Nevertheless, Turkey will "particularly continue our relations with Iran in this matter and in many other matters," said the Turkish President who had repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The US has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic since its rise from the International Atomic Agreement with Iran. According to the United States, Iran has been pursuing a nuclear programme in secret and is not bound by the Agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the outbreak of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. In the past months, the tensions in the Gulf region have been very strong.
U.S. Government wants to restrict the admission of refugees
The U.S. government wants to severely restrict the admission of refugees. The US Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on Thursday that the annual ceilings for a new visa programme would be reduced from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, which is equivalent to an average of 40 per cent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the United States would continue to be committed to the support of refugees. However, the most important task is to protect and serve US citizens.
The US Government wants to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are at risk, as reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
At the 1980 programme, refugees from UN camps are selected throughout the world and relocated to the United States. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the financial year 2020 would be the lowest in the history of the programme. The current ceiling of 30,000 is a deep value. As the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, the White House, was left behind, the number was almost 85,000.
Help organizations responded immediately to the announced decline of the upper limit. "This is a very sad day for America," said the Chief of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The United States would further damage its leadership role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to limit immigration in the United States as illegal. The US government expects its own data for the next budget year 350,000 asylum applications. These figures are separate from the new site program.
Donald Trump - "A Spitzel Comes Near"
U.S. President Donald Trump has been involved in the Whistblower campaign of the spy. Whoever, too, has seen the informant who has challenged his use of power for evidence, "comes close," said Trump, according to a record of a private event on Thursday in New York. Several U.S. media reports agree.
Then Trump spoke to the staff of the United States UN mission. When asked about the person who informed the Whiteman about the controversial events in the White House, he replied, "It's coming close." Then Trup added, "Do you know what we've done in times past when we were slaves? Right. The spy and traitor, we made a little more than we do now."
The Democrats took note of the possible execution of the death penalty. The Democrats used harsh criticism of Trump's beliefs and threatened him with expulsion from the witnesses. It also attempted to prevent Congress investigation into a possible arrest procedure against him, writing to the Committees for Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Oversight in the House of Representatives.
The Whistblower calls the president in a complaint that is now published, to have his office misused to request an admission of another country to the U.S. election 2020. In particular, it is his controversial phone with his Ukrainian official colleague Woodymyr Selenssky in the summer: In his speech, Trump was close to him to lead statements against his potential democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine.
It is still unclear who the Whistleblower is and its informants. As New York Times reports, however, it should be an analysis of the CIA's foreign secret service.
Refugee boat known: Baby and little children drinking in eggies
Once again people are trying to get across the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. On a regular basis, there are often too many small boats. In the course of a rescue boat, there are now seven migrants about life - including five children.
Before the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants came to life on the way to a rescue boat. Among the victims of death were a baby as well as four other children, the Greek Coast Guard reported. Four children, three women and five men were able to be rescued from the flow of the occupation of a pre-fabricated pilot.
Among the victims was also to be a key, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants broke off in the morning from Turkey. They had tried to reach the small island group Innousses in the northeastern part of Chios Island.
Since then, hundreds of migrants from Turkey have moved to the Greek islands in the east of Ågäis, mostly in very small boats. Last year, 174 people were on this route after reporting the United Nations refugee work (UNHCR).
The Who Breaks the Concert
A U.S. rock band The Who has found an old end because of the indisputableness of Leadsanger Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the event in Houston, he said his voice to the audience: "I think I should leave it as long as it goes".
Leader guitarist Pete Towsend asked for forgiveness and added that Daltrey could "not really speak now". The audience promised Towsend to come to a refurbishment concert at his expense. But a term is not yet fixed.
For Friday in Dallas and for Sunday in Denver, The Who said they should be followed by a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old gang colleague Towsend are the only founding members left. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rental immediately set: WeWork allows real estate markets to sit
In New York, WeWork has become the largest bureaucrat.
Within a few years, WeWork is rising from the small startup to rising power on the world's most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis.
The crisis of the company's owner's company WeWork aims to destroy the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. The company had set up founder Adam Neumann a few days ago, moved the planned delivery process and started selling subsidiaries and securities such as the driver's license to win financial space for the coming weeks and months. WeWork also reported, among other things, the end of new offers with immediate effect.
WeWork rents large offices for a long time and offers them short-term in small units to members. This can be a single liberator, small startups, or entire divisions of large companies. So long as WeWork is burnt with this business at an alarming rate. In the past year, the company has incurred a loss of $1.6 billion, with a turnover of $1.8 billion. In this year, only the cost of rent should be increased by the rental of an estimated $2.5 billion.
As a result, WeWork has concluded between contracts with durations of up to 15 years, with commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge commitments could not only become a problem for the company itself and its investors, but also for all real estate markets.
Economics Dan Alpert from the Cornell Law School in New York met WeWork in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the last 24 months, nearly 300,000 square meters of office space. Only WeWorks new contracts ensured that demand for offices in New York was larger than the new areas that were now new to the market. Without WeWorks expansion, the office education rate in the US Metropole would have increased at this time, as Alpert wrote in the Business Insider. Similarly, it appears in London where we work among thousands of office premises in the best place.
Even in the UK capital, the balance of the real estate market could be lost without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the principal owner, in a recent year by the Deka banker Deka for almost 100 million euros purchased by the office house in the center of the financial metropolis.
Many tenants have built their properties for WeWork's requirements with high investment. WeWork is designed to make his business model profitable soon, so that the real estate owners may have to write down a part of the expected billions of purchases. Access to the - regardless of how close - bookings of WeWork do not have long-term rental contracts. Because weWork is generally rented by any extra-founded subsidiaries, such as Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company has only a few borders.
Russia took again numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard was again opposed to North Korean fishermen. In the past few days, 262 other foresters, who had been illegally fishing in the waters, shared with the Russian Inland Service FSB of the Interfax Agency on Friday.
Just ten days ago, 161 fishermen were arrested from North Korea. Before the border guards were shot and three of them were wounded. This time they did not have any injuries, the Communist Republic of North Korea suffered a chronic food shortage.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way to Russian waters. The coastal waters of Russia follow their own data to protect their marine resources patrols. During the recent checks, 30,000 tint-fish were discovered. In addition, the data were collected after three fishing boats and two motorboats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok. The Agency Ria Nowosti subsequently set up the coastal waters of 2018 in total more than 8,000.
The Russian Fisheries Authority also did not issue a prison licence to the North Koreans, according to domestic entrepreneurs’ complaints. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been arrested since 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fisheries companies in the primorje region, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained of high environmental damage by the North Korean fishermen. They were suffering from massive synthetic networks banned in Russia. These would also take small habitats from the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be taken into the sea, where they needed 200 years to be transported. The ships themselves do not comply with the hygiene and technical regulations.
Three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured after the arrests in the previous week. A wounded North Koreanman also died after his injuries. On 17 September, the Russian border guard first set up a North Korean ship and then a second after the fire opened.
United States of America to ban entry against ex-President Castro
The United States has joined the former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children's entry ban. The US Ministry of Foreign Affairs justified the "great human rights abuses" in a communication on Thursday with Castro. As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean, he is facing a system that would soon take place in the thousands of Cubans and give more than 100 political prisoners.
As President of the War Forces, Fidel Castro was responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela, the American Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo, who was responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had banned entry bans among others against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, for months, there has been a fierce struggle between the government and the opposition. The United States has imposed a series of sanctions against the Maduros government to force him into the knee and to help the opposition leader and vice-president Juan Guaidó.
Cuba is considered one of the most interconnected Maduros. The socialist Caribbean has received oil from Venezuela in exchange for medical services. After the US and Venezuelan opposition has been assessed, Cuba has also sent numerous secret agents to Venezuela to help the government in the oppression of government opponents.
New Climate Protest von Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests, thousands of people want to go on the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate week, the movement of Fridays for Future is re-planting actions and competitions in thousands of countries around the world. In the beginning, due to the time gap between New Zealand and Australia, the protests over Europe to North America began to take place. There, climateist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major competition in the Canadian Montreal. Before the White House in Washington, protesters wanted to gather.
How great the worldwide demand for this Friday will be after the record participation of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was a good thing. "Last Friday, over four million people have extended for the climate. This Friday we do it again!" she wrote on Twitter.
Especially in Germany the event was very big. A good third of all the world's demonstrators - about 1.4 million - had participated in the protests in 575 German cities. This time a list of the movements of customers is planned in at least 65 cities. Among them, in Metropoles such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westernland, people want to go to the streets.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had set himself before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to call on the politicians of her country for a stronger use of climate protection. This has resulted in the formation of the Fridays for Future movement. The climate protests involve, in particular, students and students, but also scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand greater respect from policy in the fight against earthquakes and emerging climate disasters. In particular, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming needs to be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees in comparison with the pre-industrial period.
Thunberg had arrived almost a month after a two-week Transatlantic Tower with a high-sea-Ring in New York. There she had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she held an emotional discussion with the UN in which she finally spoke to the Head of State and Government of the Earth. In her home Stockholm, she was invited on Wednesday for her use of the alternative Nobel Prize for the Right to Lifelessness Foundation.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
The people in Russia can no longer smoke on the balcony in the future. This is a change in fire protection. "This is also true for smoking," said a spokesman from the emergency ministry on Thursday in Moscow of the Agency of Tass. The ban is to enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes, then has to pay a fine of 3,000 rubles (EUR 42,46). If the cigarette is to fire, the penalty will fall higher. Under the ban, burning candles will fall to the ministry. Even meat samples on the balcony are no longer allowed.
Battle against cybercrime - detectors high server out
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators first raised a large server provider for illegal business in the dark.
In total, 13 workers are suspected of hosting a computer center in a former Nato bunker in Traben-Tarbach on the Moselle website to operate on the international crime scene.
This was shared by the General government administration in Cobenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday afternoon at a large event. The Darknet is a detached part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects, among other things, are supposed to have been the operator of the world's second largest Darknet Market for Drugs, "Wall Street Market", which had been launched by the investigators in the spring. Also, the attack on 1.25 million Telekom-Router End November 2016 has been controlled by General State Administration over a server in Cyberbunker.
One such host was first raised in Germany. A webhost provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
In the case of access operations with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there have been studies in Germany and in neighbouring countries. They have been the result of almost five years of research. On the afternoon, the investigators want to inform you about further details.
New global climate protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests today, thousands of people want to go to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate-week, the movement of Fridays for Future re-emerged actions and competitions in thousands of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests have been planned in at least 65 cities, including in Metropolen, Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Juchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westernland in Sylt.
Who are Thunberg's terminals?
Justice and courage are high players, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoking factories that heat the climate. So it's amazing that a 16-year-old girl who weighs the power of this time keeps the mirror before the nose. But what does it matter? Is there help preparation or blind marketing of a climateist? Historic performance or manipulative tactics about herself?
On the other hand, Greta Thunberg places the masses in motion and brings young people up for a better climate-friendly world. It has not been seen in Europe for the first time that a young man has created a collection of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212 a child named Nikolaus from Cologne has felt exhausted to become a more righteous world. At that time this also has a scar on young people and it has led them to cross the sea to reach the country that he has recently made on his journey to America with a sailboat.
But there is a shadow page in this regard? Why do you need an action called "We don't have time", to save the world? Besides, Greta Thunberg has a rich PR manager on her side. Besides, her mother has published a book that has been widely sold thanks to the existing daughter in the framelight. The old-fashioned follow-up of Greta Thunberg was also a little equipped over the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably too hard to put up with. This is also not why the action came very well to the world and there is a lot of money thanks to the imposed action.
The spirit is now divided: Is it morally right to be saved in the salvation of the world? Is it still authentic when certain groups of people work together during the world rescue action with springmakers? However, as a last resort, a critical and reflective point of view is increasingly important in a democraticized society, as democracy lives in different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can also make it possible to ask critically out of consideration of certain trends.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest across our solar system
A foreign comet crosss at the moment of our solar system.
The confusion of the astronomers has confirmed: a foreign comet crosss at the moment of our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time, the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have the certainty: A comet from another star is crossed at the moment of our solar system. He was baptized after his discovery 2I/Borisov and is employed by astronomers around the world.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by Amateurastronome on the Crime · Global Voices
The body was discovered by an amateurastrone named Gennadi Borissow on the Crime. He looked at a self-constructed telescope in the sky and confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually about an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. He is only the second of his kind, which was seen during the passage.
The great chance for astronomers is now to increase from a close perspective into a foreign solar system. Apparently, the comet resembles our own system, as reported by the Canary Astrophysicist Institute. The comet is clearly an interstellar source from the International Astronomy Union (IAC) and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbelway that runs it out of our system.
Comet has already been seen before arrival - and can be observed for several months
But before it is so far, astronomers can observe him closely. In contrast to his predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his influence, which means that he can be examined for many months from the earth. "The object will be the greatest light in December and will then be seen by mid-April 2020 with medium-sized telescopes," says Davide Farnocchia of the U.S. Space Authority Nasa. "It will be only with even larger, professional telescopes until October 2020".
The developers of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumumumaa".
First knowledge about comet 2I/Borisov awakens hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers across the horizon. At the same time, the heavenly bodies seem to be similar to our comets - as the IAC champion Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the Switzerland is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems can be formed by similar processes as in ours, complemented by the León's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond simple knowledge. Two such objects have already been discovered within just two years, in some cases a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
The researchers continue to work on asteroids again. Just recently, a giant asteroid passed over the earth, and it was dangerous to approach them.
"Absolutely Compulsory": Rachel Johnson sits by brothers
In order for Boris Johnson to be united. First, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister tastes the military language of the prime minister as "smooth". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Betrug", the contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson stands under pressure and continues to speak - at least this afternoon. At the interrogation hour in the house, the opposition was being massized, and among other things, more critics have been reported to say: Dutty Bishops and his sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told the sender Sky News, her brother using words such as capitalisation, as if the opponents of an EU institution should be "deprived, beaten, beaten, tortured and fed." They held this to be too competitive. They did not recognize the version of their brother, Rachel Johnsons, who had been elected to the European Parliament for the Anti-Brexit Party "Cange UK".
In particular, she said that her brother Jo Cox mentioned that an EU-friendly subcontractor who had been murdered a few days before the Austria referendum 2016. Their thoughts could be best expressed by passing the Brexit, by saying, "It is very nice to have a member of the House who was murdered by someone called 'Brittain first'," now critically criticized Johnson's sister. The acter was apparently from the right-hand warehouse, which was strengthened "by this kind of language" for all who were suffering from it.
The Twitter user of Cox also criticized the Prime Minister. "It hurts me if Jos name is used like this," he tweeted. The best way to honor them is to be patient and to decide for what you believe - no matter what you look like. But you should never "demonise the other side." He also claimed that an atmosphere was created, that it was likely in the attack.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson, a younger brother, had laid down his office as a state secretary and his mandate as a tour director. "I was breaking up between loyalty to the family and national interest - it is an inexhaustible tension," Jo Johnson explained the step.
Johnson's language also arose in the church on sharp criticism. As the "Times" reports, all 118 bishops and bishops of the Church of England criticize the language "this country is not worthy" and in a common state they declare, "In the past days, the language, both in debates and outside Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak with respect to each other".
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez take on Super Bowl
In the year of its 100-year-old existence, the NFL has a strong sign: In the half-time of the next Super Bowl, two women with Latin roots are engaged. They promise "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina power at Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver half-time show at the next end of the US football league NFL. This was announced by the organizers on Thursday (Ordertime).
"I feel incredibly ashamed and anxious to represent the Latin community in addition to Jlo, because this has an incredible strength in the USA," Shakira shared in a video with.
The final of the American Football League, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, takes place in Miami on February 2nd. In the Metropolis at the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Flower") is a Puerto Rican origin.
"I love the fact that the Super Bowl puts two women on the stage - and two Latins," Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of pleasure and energy".
The 50-year-olds were born in New York, after their parents were expelled from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, they sang with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as a actor and has been seen in the drama "Hustlers" in the German cinemas since November.
Shakira was known in Colombia as the star of a Telenovela and Singerin. She created her first bilingual album in 2001 and the single "Wenever, Everywhere".
The announcement of half-time guests is expected in the United States every time, with tension. In this year many also value the election as a political gesture. Finally, the country, not least by President Donald Trump's immigration policy, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sports event and at the same time is a giant advertising scene. Musicaries like Justin Timberlake, Beyonce, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and Rolling Stones were there for Furore. In fact, there are over 100 million television viewers in the NFL terminal, it is also popular in Germany.
In the past year, there have been political controversy. The fight against the Quarterback Colin Kaapernick, which had refused to protest against the police violence against black people, has been severely criticized by U.S. President Donald Trump. From solidarity with Kaapernick, some musicians have rejected a super-bowl performance - including Rihanna and Pink. The rock group Maroon 5 was finally criticized by many.
An actor and Youtuber sets Egypt's ruler: First, Mohamed Ali remains in the country but prefers abroad.
The two men, who influenced whether Egypt's streets were moving again, had spent a pleasant time in New York: U.S. President Donald Trump had taken steps against political Islam and had no power over human rights violations in Cairo again on Friday at the airport. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-General, the 2013 Muslim brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected head of the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: U.S. President Donald Trump had taken steps against the political Islam and had no power over human rights violations on the Nile.
In the Irish, this is what the president of the other men, who is currently determining the situation on the streets, is trying to do. Mohamed Ali, of course, stayed out of the country where he would immediately withdraw from the security forces when he was being attacked by Egyptian soils. Weeks earlier, the 45-year-old player was only a minority of the Egyptians. Today he is the tone of voice that dominates the political discourse in the cafes, the living rooms and the country's testing rooms: with his YouTube channel "Mohameds Secrets" Ali calls his country's people against Sisi.
He goes to the head of state directly and in a rather rustic language. While the people are hungry, poor President in luxury and lets themselves build beautiful new palaces, that is. The army, which supports the Sisi's sovereignty, represents corruption and scope. Because he has been in his second job as a construction worker for 15 years, he seems to know exactly what he is talking about - at least the impression of many Egypters, such as the very exploding clicks.
After the first week since Sisis Griff had demonstrated thousands of anti-government attacks and almost 2,000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights defenders and opposition politicians, were arrested, called Ali on this Friday for a "Million March". That would be unlikely for so many people on the streets. But there were a number of small protests, such as in Giseh at Cairo and in the country of Luxor. Videos in social media, whose participants Al-Sisi had been accused of corruption. When these protests did, the police also resorted to a million march.
From the city of Mansura in Nildelta, where demonstrators were arriving last week with the president's portrait in pieces, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security checkpoints created in the city and on the streets. In Cairo several railway stations in the city were closed because of "containing work" which were blocked most of the streets around the Tahirir Square, the heart of the revolution of 2011. And on the Raba Square, which appeared on the side of the Muslim bridge in 2013 before the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, a further measure was needed to prevent them from entering the city because of the "containing work" of the city, which was blocked in the heart of the 2011 revolution.
Mohamed Ali made these preparations to change his tactics: "Our goal must not be the train station," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Let us not meet with police officers." But as a retreater, it would not be understood: "without Egypt is the train station".
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection seems to be much slower than the provider, there are various possibilities.
If you conclude an Internet contract, you do not need to trust the provider's speed limit. Customers can check how much of this is actually achieved in case of accidents.
Finally, the aforementioned transmission rates are part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explained the consumer central Bayern.
If the connection seems to be much slower than the supplier, there are various possibilities. Thus, the Federal Network Agency (BnetA) measuring the actual data transmission rates and comparing them with the agreed rate agreed in the contract.
"The tests of suppliers, however, are carried out according to specific standards and are therefore not uniform and objectively calculated," the user-centred Bayerns said to be concerned on their side.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable period of 14 days in order to perform the promised performance. This is done in the best way by signing the entry.
If this does not happen even after multiple requests, customers can advertise and under circumstances also demand damage. However, in the case of permanent success, it only helps the customer.
First ranked Republicans for the investigation
As the first high-ranking Republicans, the Governor of Vermont spoke for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it comes from, it is determined by the facts that will be determined," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wanted to know more about the Whistblower case before measures - an impeachment procedure could lead to the resignation of the President.
Scott said he was not surprised by the surprises that Trup repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensskyj to investigate the interventions of the democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine.
The Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump because of the Whistblower affair; a few have failed to recognize this. Scott's statements are a first sign of this in the Trumps Party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already resorted to policies against Trump several times, such as the closure of environmental protection regulations and the deterioration of immigration rules.
Spider-Man remains in the MCU: Another Marvel film
It was a shock for all Spider-Man-Fans: at the end of August it was announced that Sony and Marvel will be going separate ways in the future. Tom Hollands Spider-Man would then not be part of the "Avenger" University. It was completely unclear how it should go with the films around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man gets after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home" another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). This reports several U.S. media in agreement. Therefore, the cinematography should also be determined: In the USA the film will run from July 16, 2021.
The magazine "Screenrant" quotes Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige as saying, "I am pleased that Spiderys will continue to work in the MCU. I and all of us are pleased to be able to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universities, since Sony continues to work in his Speedy Version. You don't know what the future will bring".
But how does it come to the sudden good news? So Sony Marvel is supposed to have submitted an offer. According to industry magazines, the company Disney, which is also part of Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the recording of the upcoming Spider-Man films. However, the message is not confirmed.
That's how Herzogin Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" terminals
After nine stages, the series "Suits" was reached in the United States between the great finale. In the latter, there were many Happy Ends and also many Cameo exhibitions. Also, the Royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who had been active in the series for many years, was assigned to the Charming Tribut. Attention, the following sections contain players to the series finals.
One way: Herzogin Meghan did not return to the final for a final decision as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some of the most memorable scenes with today's heart. Like the moments of the broken and happy wedding with Mike or as they welcomed him after his resignation.
However, her true husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned in the "Suits" finals, of course in a wedding scene. As Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) just wrote off the altar to marry her deceased Sheila (Rachel Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a lot of comments about this approach. If he has actually passed a spell, the oppressed Harvey wants to know from the bride class only briefly: "Louis, you are not the prince of England".
Age: Baby and four other children drinking at boat accident
At the center of a flight boat in the Aegean, a baby and four other children were drowned. In total, seven people died in the accident, as the Greek Coast Guard reported on Friday.
The boat sailed near the Greek island of Inouses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
At present, hundreds of migrants from Turkey to the Greek islands in the east of Ågheis. Last year, 174 people were on this route, according to the United Nations refugee relief work (UNHCR). Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleagues and the competent EU Commissioner in Turkey, he wanted to " inform himself about the refugee situation", said Seahofer on Friday. He wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens so that he could help in handling the situation.
A spokesman from the EU Commission confirmed the planned trip of Seahofers on Friday with EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and French Minister of Interior Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, there are still unusual numbers of migrants from Turkey. On Tuesday alone 654 people were on the Greek islands, it was taken from the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Is the Turkish deal still working?
The increased numbers have raised doubts as to the functioning of the 2016 EU-Turkey Agreement, which provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants illegally across Turkey to the Greek islands.
However, the processing of asylum items is only necessary on the Greek side due to personal deficiencies. At Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, almost 29 400 people are detained by the Ministry of Civil Protection. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: In a warehouse with capacity for 650 people, 5200 migrants are currently under siege.
Since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016, so many of them have been reported by the state hearing.
Climate change: Hot leads to more heart problems
Doctors will then test the health system in the future. Climate change will be one of the greatest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society for Cardiology. In particular, the heart crisis system created high temperatures and high temperature sources in a short time and led to increased heart rate. In particular, people with heart disease, older people and diabetics were affected.
Green Politicians have to answer for painful photospanes
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election struggle - was this why the bechers manipulated?
The Canadian Green Chef holds a multiway beaver in the hand of a photo. But now came out: The beaver was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has remained quite undetectable for a long time - and finally disappeared. The reusable coffee maker with metal stream has never kept Elizabeth May, the chief of Canadian vegetables. On the party's website she was to see a photo with this bet, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo was already published and distributed to the media - and there was yet another black (paper) beers, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green Chef has to answer because of photopanes
The May National Post, however, was manipulation and that the Fake News party was producing to make the topic "environmental protection" appear more credible. And that was in the middle of a domestic election struggle, in which Trudeau has also become increasingly difficult because of a housing scandal.
The photo went viral in the social media and started the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The greens manipulate a photo of their president to keep their entrances secret."
May showed shock and insisted on her blog to have no knowledge of this action. To underline this, she also posted the original: You, in conversation with the citizens, a becher in the hand. However, she put it right, be out of Bambus. She always had it. A speaker of the party said it was just that it was gone to bring the partiologist into the picture, and not to translate something. From the photo it is only to see a section on the website.
May writes, it grieves her for the staff who did so. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there's nothing to hide," she says to the guardand said at the same time, "If they have fun again, they couldn't make a picture with my face so I look younger?"
The German Greens were also said because of their use of en route plastics or because of flying in Shitstorms - but their pictures were not photoshopped. Thus, the chief of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, reported on the Eis holiday with plastic ceilings, such as markerur.de*.
Influenzarin wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathy
If Jaqueline Ng by mail from Cathy Pacific was guaranteed an upgrade. But when she asked for it at check-in, she would not be on board - and she would never be able to fly with Cathy again.
Spontan gets an upgrade for the Business Class - from which many guests sleep. Sometimes they are lucky, and the check-in staff offer a free change from the Economy Class.
However, this case shows how you should not do it: A self-explained influenceer has prayed for free upgrade by the Airlines Cathy Pacific. On the Instagram, Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7th.
On the trip, employees of Jaqueline refused an upgrade, although they had presented a mail in which their Cathy Pacific apparently looked up an upgrade. The letter wanted to receive the influence of a marketing employee of the Airlines. However, the Airlines accused Jaqueline of having failed the mail.
On the return trip, Jaqueline tried to get an upgrade for the long-range flight. This time she was supposed to have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The staff at JFK airport were skeptical: they were hacking at the center. And in fact, the employees from whom the mail was supposed to have broken off the mail contact with Jaqueline were also confirmed by the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
The airport staff canceled Jaqueline's ticket and joined a live flight ban with Cathy Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (about €1.280), they had to buy a new ticket to Taiwan.
In her case, the Influenzarin turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that lost the consumer interest. Because Cathy had replaced the price for her original ticket, Jaqueline also asked for the cost of the new ticket.
However, as long as Jaqueline does not submit the mail's metadata, the case remains clear: For Cathy, the influencein has begun, it remains closed for future flights. The business conditions of the Airlines also require that they do not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to satisfy itself - and is now a lawyer.
Oil prices after report on the status of weapons in Yemen
The oil prices fell on Friday's day in the shortest time. A barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea resort Brent 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the morning. The price for a barrel of the American type West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to $55.77.
A report from the Wall Street Journal on a state of arms in Yemen was issued for the course. Saudi Arabia is expected to have approved a state of arms in four areas.
A Drohnen attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia occurred in mid-September five percent of the world's oil production. The Huthi rebels associated with Iran in the civil war had announced the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia is responsible for the US government.
If an agreement really exists, you can focus on growth and demand care, said Ole Hansen, Head of the Department's R & D strategy at the Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg News Agency.
The oil prices continue to move in the past day. One week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to $59, Brent nearly $65.

North Korea holds the third drop of Trump and Kim for questioning
North Korea has no doubt suggested that it will soon come to a third summit of Machthaber Kim Young-un and US President Donald Trump. The purpose and success of such a meeting were to be questioned for the lack of progress in the implementation of the first summit agreements in Singapore, said Chief Diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday at the KCNA agency.
The United States had not done anything to implement the summit's decisions in the previous year, the North Korean Foreign Ministry's consultant said. He also criticized strong US sanctions and the joint military forces over the United States and South Korea. But he hoped for a "wise" and "much" decision to bring it to an approach again.
Trup had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim was to bring him before he realized it. The negotiations on a resolution of the North Korean nuclear and rocket programme have been held since the two separate summits of Trump and Kim in February in Hanoi.

Doping: Show more Russian manipulations
Material from the Moscow Analytical Laboratory is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, the first director of the World Antidoping Agency (Wada) and today's Head of Integrity of the Light Telematics World Alliance.
In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Lab finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Antidoping Agency (Wada). Now it appeared that they were falsified.
In December 2014, a systematic meeting was held in Russian sports. The Wada had closed the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time Russian athletes were not entirely bound by the world stage. The International Olympic Committee had attended an individual test at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio around 270 athletes from the country under neutral flag, with 168 Russian athletes and athletes at the beginning of February 2018. At the World Cups in various sports parties, they also had to be held in Russia in summer with the Fussball-WM host.
Positive missing
The following September, the Wada reopened the Rusada band, but requested access to the laboratory and the samples concerned. The data should be concluded on the extent of the replacement of doping cases at state doping. They should help punish athletes and athletes at night. Three months later they were finally delivered.
The President of the Independent Integration Commission (IAU) of the Lichtatelletics World Federation (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data were manipulated from the Moscow Analytic Laboratory. "Yes. We have received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force has received the correct data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter General Journal" of the Friday. "We have identified a number of discrepants between the data that Wada received from a Whistler, and those that they received from the Russians in January". Many positive findings were missing in the McLaren report.
The WM does not concern
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Light Telecommunications Connection is considered the only organization in Ban Russia. At the WM in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under neutral flag. They had to prove that they were trained outside the Russian system and subjected to tests.
By the beginning of this week, the Wada manipulations had already taken place in the space and Russia had asked Russia to respond to the premises within three weeks. Russia is now experiencing the new spree of Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion of the Olympic Games 2020 in Tokyo.
