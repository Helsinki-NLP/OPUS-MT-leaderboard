I shouldn't be out of my log.
Why?
Tom is very confident.
I know we still love each other.
I'm sorry I waited for you.
What have you got?
Stay here.
It's very expensive at the hospital.

It's your fault.
Read it first.

It's less than me.
How long have you been in Boston?
How am I going to the station?
Tom thought it would save her from the diners.
It's easier to write about death than to write about life.

Don't leave me alone.
Please eat something.
He's not here yet.
At my father's house.
Look, there's a difference in the yard!
I'm a student.
My father opened up.
I think you two know Tom.

Don't talk to Tom like that.
He told me.
What language is spoken in the United States?
I'm reading English.
Let us in.
He gave the talk.
He's not here yet.

What have you brought?
He told me he was going to Venice.
Listen to me.
Can you believe it?
He's younger than me.
I don't speak Japanese.
We're both right.
Tom's asleep outside.
Sit down.
Don't worry about me.
It's late.
What happened?
I agree with you.
How much of it?
How can they forget us?
I understand your situation.
I'm not Tom.
What a joke!
My book's here.
I'm Tom's wife.
I'm not very busy right now.
Where are you going on Saturday?
They're checking.
Tom Jackson wrote three books.
Tom told me today.
I don't want to go to Boston.
Your answer is wrong.
I know.
I'm having a little fun.
I'm not proud of it.
It's running.
The train came as soon as possible, so we didn't have to wait.

I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Come with me.
Is that your new boyfriend?

Where are you?
Just smile.

Everyone's lying.
I'm your friend.
Time's up.
Try again.
Have you ever eaten fresh fish?
He gave the talk.
I need him.
You're a long man!
I did my job.
I want my hat.
I was hurt.
I don't need my body.
Where he went, his dog followed him.
You're not a doctor?
I saw him running.

No one understands me.
Let's go.

I'm busy.
You can go home now.
He's younger than me.
I think Tom's fine.
I'll be back in Australia in two days.
Tom told Mary he was going to kill himself, but it wasn't as brave as it was.
Will you go fish with us?
Although it's not bad for itself, in many cases it's seen too much television.
You should ask him for advice.
I'll take him.
I'm tired.
I'm sorry.
I'm still your friend.
I still can't believe I believed Tom.
Be careful.
My son can't sing yet.
Let's see if you can drive.
I'm eating.
I don't want to get hurt.
How far from this station?

My head's broken.
Go to the hospital.
The president is back.
Please forward the note.
Panta's broken.
Tom always keeps talking about him.
She doesn't eat anything except fruit.
I'm denying it.
Wait outside.
I want a taxi now.
Shut up.
Who is he?
It's almost three times that way.

He's my wife.
I'm not very good at sitting down.
Where's the Porton office?
Don't go.
Your shoes are here.
He didn't tell me his name.
Okay, I'll see you later.

Tom doesn't want to do that.
It's going to cost $30.
Start here.
We waited for them.
I like my yellow color.
Tom was right about keeping a diary.
He doesn't eat anything except fruit.
I'm not your friend.
How old is he?
Come back.
Why are you yelling?
Can I have a check?
Do you have anything bigger?
Tom brought two of me.
I need it.
I don't think you need any help.
Wait outside Tom Gate.
Don't wait.
Is the machine open today?
Don't wait.
Don't worry about me.
Shall we eat outside today?
Keep Tom away from me.
Tom's in trouble.
He's Kashalen.
Are my London hats made?
Where can I buy it?
I need a fax.
He eats a little more.
He taught me to write.
Call my husband.
I could play that song.
I was surprised.
Where's Boston?

The rules are simple.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
You're much better than me.
He's not here yet.
I can't shake my right hand.
I'm in the hospital.
Tom took the key.
Tom, I want to talk to Mary.
Can you understand me?
When Tom heard that Mary had married another man, he was very surprised to see her.
Most of the success depends on the effort.
Tom's very hot.
Tom's got his head covered.
Were you born there?
Everyone knows that now.
I got my juice.
I'm so sorry.
Are you still reading this?
What's in the cupboard?
Connection has been lost.
Can I get a cup of tea?
When did you break your leg?
I want to name the next step.
How are you?
I'll go to the dentist tomorrow.
I can't believe it!
Isn't that right?
He's not here yet.
They're doctors.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Have you ever been running?
He was talking.
I have two brothers.
What about you?
I didn't have to tell Tom anything.
Try harder.

I'm reading your book.
Let's go.
I'm looking around a little bit.
Here's your key.
He didn't go to the party.
The furniture is now closed.
My hands are breaking.
Everyone saw it.
It's good and not bad.
He sleeps like children.
Who are they?
What do I mean, you can understand?
Would you please speak more slowly?
It's still mine.
Don't come.
Tom, you can't get out of this.
Tom's body's bad.
You can choose whatever you want.
Tom was helping me.
Leave him alone.
Let's wait here.
How long does the satellite bus leave for the airport?
Stay home.
Tell me what you want.
I don't know if I'll have time to do this.
Tom keeps talking about him.
I want you to call Tom.
Tom bought something.
Tom's dead.
You go ahead.
We ate dinner all night.
School will start tomorrow.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I'm not waiting.
I don't think Tom hates you.
What's that down there?
A football game.
The sky is clear.
Nomskare!
I'm really estimating your generosity.
He told me he'd go to Venice.
What's your phone number?
He's right.
What does this mean?
The letter was written.
Stop here.
Tom saw you.
Come with me.
No, thank you.
Wait here.
Have I been a little too late?
Let her go.
I can't say right.
It's a means of communication.
Tom knows that.
I've never heard of Tom.
How long has the train left for Tokyo?
Tom's wearing a big shirt.
Are they yours?
What are you talking about?
I'll work.
What's your name?
I agree with you.
You're rich.
Are you going to America next month?
I don't want to go to the summit.
I'm not the owner.
Thank you very much.
He's not here yet.
I'm sorry!
I want to tell you something.
Broff represents the ultimate power of power.
Come out.
They made a joke.
I ran away from home.
We built pancakes for the rest of the world.
Don't you have a bike?
I don't know if I'm coming.
You're kidding.
He's dead.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Everyone saw it.
I'll have my lunch and lunch tomorrow morning.
My son came to my house.
I'm a student.
I'll be there.
Do you have your passport?
Please just give me my promotion.
Do what he says.
You're so excited to see.
Tom started talking.
Stay there.
I wasn't alone.
I've learned a lot from you.
It's wrong.
Tom always keeps talking about her.
Is Tom here?
I'm a doctor.
We've seen them.
Today's 18 June and today's Muriel's birthday.
Who won?
Come on, let's get ready.
We have to tell our empty Tom to do this for us, right?
Can I get these cards?
I'm going to Osaka Station.
I don't think Tom owes it.
Someone's a trap.
I went to rest.
I learned to survive without him.
My father is very good.
I want you to stay with Tom.
Just calm down.
Tom was very busy with the job.
I'm not proud of the way I used it.
I'm looking.
We'll work.
He's here.
I don't agree with him.
Come to me.
I'm looking.
My watch doesn't work properly.
Forget Tom.
What courage!
Is this Tom's book?
He's gone to bed.
Who are you?
I could've died.
Are you sure?
We have to go now.
He's in school.
I didn't want Tom to see me.
They eat healthy food.
My mother loves music.
He just burned his head.
Where he goes, his dog is behind him.
Who is it?
Can I work here?
There's still a problem.
My nose's getting old bottled up.
I need my finger.
I don't want to go.
When will the next bus leave?
What does that mean?
Don't you have a bike?
Do you want to come?
My mother can play very well.
He knows where we are.
I know your name.
Tom's not here anymore.
What did he say?
He worked as our guide.
Tom stopped calling.
How old is Tom?
Come on! Come on!
Stop checking.
Was Tom there?
I've been bleeding twice today.
My leg's still breaking.
Where's Tom?
They think they're American.
You were the only friend of Tom.
I went to the hospital.
I accepted his invitation.
My father can drive very well.
I'll be alone.
You're gonna need a friend.
Forget about Tom.
I think Tom said his stepfather Jackson.
You've known Tom for a long time.
I know.
I'm playing football now.
My owner hasn't arrived yet.
Tom hasn't come here yet.
Please wait until he comes.
Tom kept his word very low.
There's something wrong.
Is anyone in the house?
What are you doing?
I think Tom's fine.
Where do I get the Stamps?
I'm going to check.
Can he speak French?
Tom might want to take it.
We love our country.
Is he a doctor?
And a little nibe?
And one day he left.
They wanted to steal the car.
I'm still your friend.
Hold on to that woman.
How old is that church?
Ask me tomorrow.
It's still mine.
Where am I going to claim my inheritance?
We do what we want.
Tommy's right.
I ran to my mother.
This book is for all students whose mother tongue is not Japanese.
Tom wanted to be Minister.
Who will you trust?
He's a doctor.
You can talk.
That's what I got.
No one's important.
Are you here?
The rest of us are home.
How long will you stay?
Have you seen the man in this picture?
I've lost my wallet.
I think it's impossible for Tom.
I don't want to wake Tom.
My son's got the money.
It looks like it's going to start tonight.
How much will it cost?
You better know what Tom wants.
We'll go.
I can't stop Kashi.
I want Tom to be happy.
Those who live in the kitchen should not be left behind.
Why are you yelling?
Stop Tom.
I think I should go to my hospital.
Tom wants his hat back.
Is Tom in the house?
Tom always keeps talking about him.
I'm going to have a break.
I'm your friend.
How long have you been?
Who's here?
The city is divided by a river east and west.
That's what you're looking at.
Do you understand what he's saying?
I have to go to sleep.
Do you have a car?
Tomo's playing guitar.
Do you want to do something now?
He's running now.
Can you keep your eye on Tom?
You should ask him for advice.
This guy's making a mistake.
How many are these gods?
How much extra money should I give?
Everyone liked Tom.
What's going on here?
Here's your key.
Are you a Japanese citizen?
Just calm down.
Eat what you like.
Take it.
Have you ever broken your leg?
He's gone to bed.
We learned English.
I couldn't break my right foot.
I'm tired of hearing.
How old are you?
Can I ask you a question?
What is it?
Here's your key.
We've seen worse things.
Help Tom.
I'm pretty sure.
What's that?
He's eating.
Kogosh likes gays.
You don't understand.
My wife's breaking up.
Sit on the table.
He's younger than me.
What's your name?
We were waiting for you.
Tom was inside.
Can I use the credit card?
It's really big tonight, isn't it?
This book can be found only in France.
Tell me.
I'll take him.
Can I borrow credit cards?
Tom found my bike.
I went to Jackson's house.
He was after a black hat.
Anything else?
They're all checked.
Is there anything else for the students?
I'm eating noodles.
Tom's inside the house.
Don't ask me how they are, ask me what they're doing.
Will you come in?
I'm telling you.
We like football games.
What are you eating?
Good evening.
He's eating empty fruit.
I want new shoes for these shoes.
Everyone liked Tom.
Who's that?
I'm still your friend.
Enjoy it.
Please listen!
He's running.
I'll go to the beach in the morning, though.
My right arm is breaking.
My father was busy.
Ready to go.
I couldn't get the 700 train.
He had two daughters.
This is my wife.
Let's guess.
Do you have a pen?
The class won't start until eight.
How much time do you spend on that?
What does that word mean?
How do I get it?
Can you speak English?
What they did was wrong.
My son is far away from me.
Tom's parents were musicians.
Here's your bag.
Tom's alive.
She's seen in the fax.
Answer me.
This bag is mine.
Tom's gone to bed.
How much of it?
You can eat as much as you want.
Get out of here.
I'm a little tired.
Can you speak French?
He's a doctor.
Let's go.
How old are you?
Hold on tom.
They're watching.
You're kidding.
I don't think tomorrow's gonna rain.
When I'm done, I'll be back.
I'm good at it.
He grew up in France.
He didn't work on Sunday night.
He taught me to write.
Happy birthday!
It's not your book, it's mine.
The other people are killed.
He doesn't eat anything except fruit.
Tom's father is a swearer.
Listen.
Do you think Tom wants to eat now?
Now it's time.
I'll never make a mistake.
Where's the door to the UA 111?
I'm kidding.
Why are you looking?
Tom wants his hat back.
How much time do you usually start?
The country has made a deal between them.
I speak French with Tom.
Tom's eyes are dead.
Can this be a little bit of a gypsum?
Tom's in the garden now.
What did you forget?
I really don't want to go.
You go first.
That's my sister.
I forgot.
He's got a knife.
He's not here yet.
It's not mine.
Who's here?
He's eating fruit.
I don't speak Japanese.
I'll be grateful.
The rebels left the prisoners.
I could go with you, but it wasn't my time.
I've lost my mind.
He's a good man.
We did it.
The government has signed the petition.
Get out of the city!
Sing for rest.
He's eating.
How old is that church?
Let's go!
It can be said to Japan.
Have you seen her grow up?
Put the satellite bus in the box for the airport?
Don't worry.
It's my fault.
That's my bag.
I have an old computer that I don't need anymore.
I'm tired.
We were on our feet.
I want it.
I need those papers.
Tom made a joke.
Tom's very low-handed.
Eat whatever you want.
Tom's crying.
How much of it?
I'm fine.
They're doctors.
The plane's at the right time.
I don't know what you want to say.
Most of the visitors were businessmen.
Turn right.
Tom's probably asleep.
I've got a lot of shit.
Tom's got a lot of speed.
He knows where we are.
I've learned a lot from Tom.
Tom's gods are dead.
Everyone was screaming.
I'll stay out.
My mother can run well.
They're looking.
The investigation was successful.
I think it's less likely that Tom will be given the gold he's got.
Boston is a big city.
I'm 17 too.
Here's your key.
Let's talk about Tom.
Take your lunch.
Our name is Tom.
They were all happy.
Is this your book?
I don't want to go with Tom.
Who broke the folder?
Tom's in trouble.
Follow Tom's back.
Is Tom still on me?
Tom's dead.
We were waiting for you.
I'm not naked.
What do you know and say?
Listen to me.
We've made a lot of mistakes.
Why are you yelling?
What's your father's name?
Look at that.
Tell me if I have to.
We tried.
Tom died in October.
It's next to the doctor's office.
Happy Canada Day!
I'll be late.
What does this mean?
Tom fell on his head.
Are we ready?
I like Tom's blue Anars.
He was very patient.
How old are you?
Listen carefully.
Are you going to mess with me?
Take it easy.
They're there.
I'll check it out.
All right, everybody.
Don't let me down.
Who was it?
I'm Lazuk.
When I said that Mary left town, Tom was really surprised.
I heard the scream.
How long has your plan been?
He doesn't want to talk about it.
My book seemed attractive.
Tell me what happened.
I'm up at 8:00 today.
Please let the light shine.
Tom's in trouble.
I'm still your friend.
It took me more than two hours to translate a few pages of English.
Are they yours?
Who is he?
Is this the small road to the station?
Tom tried to kill Mary.
Did you hurt her?
It's impossible!
How long does the train reach Yokohama?
What's wrong now?
Words that don't fit in the correct order. You can replace them with more common translations.
Your shoes are here.
Everything ready for tomorrow?
Has anyone given me any news?
I want to run for you.
Listen, is this train going for Washington Square?
We failed.
There's ice in this house.
Are you after all?
Tom Boston was gone.
Clean up.
Don't open it.
Tom saw him.
It's gonna be late for tomorrow's storm.
I'm not proud of him.
Who's there?
It's a mistake.
I'm not young anymore.
He's eating.
It's just blood.
Will you go fish with us?
All right, just wait here.
I'll be back in twenty minutes.
One minute.
Tom was in pain.
Mary explained.
I don't deny it.
You don't see!
You can finish it as soon as possible.
Use it.
How long does the train reach Yokohama?
I don't understand that either.
I got seven in the morning.
I'm home.
Let's go.
Happy birthday!
I went inside.
Me too.
I'm not very busy.
That's great.
Get back!
Tom started at the casino.
They're kids.
I don't want to argue with you.
"Why don't you go?" "Because I don't want to go."
I know it.
I'll stay close.
You'll call me tomorrow.
Tell me what you want.
My leg's breaking.
Ask Tom.
I wonder what I'll give you on your birthday.
Don't forget the ticket.
Good to see you again.
Why are you yelling?
Stay right there.
The place you like is where you like food.
We played the party.
I'm busy.
Where can I buy tickets?
I've finished my job.
I'm planning on staying at the hotel.
I finally got my keys.
Tom started talking.
I'm not arguing.
Can you read it?
How old is your father?
Are you all right?
I've never been happy to see Tom.
Don't go inside.
We're lost.
Tom's looking.
We can still do that.
I tried.
I'm sick.
I see it empty, thanks.
Unfortunately it's true.
We waited for them.
How old do you think I am?
Tom's not happy here.
It's gone wrong.
I don't have to eat coffee.
Talk more carefully.
Can I get your phone number?
Why do you want to see Tom?
Here you go.
What he doesn't do we don't do.
I called my good friend Tom.
We'll never be able to play better than that.
We're Lazuk.
The bill will be filed today.
I'm going to Paris in the morning.
You'll never be alone.
You can go there.
We both know it's wrong.
Just eat what you like.
I have wine.
Why did Tom cry?
