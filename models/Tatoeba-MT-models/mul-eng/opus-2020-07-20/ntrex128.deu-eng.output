Members of the National Assembly for Wales's fears of muppets
In some members of the National Assembly, the proposal is to amend its title in "MWP" (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament).
There is reason to change the name of the National Assembly in the Welsh Parliament (Valisian Parliament).
Members of the National Assembly were afraid of becoming the target of the spot.
One member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned because the name “twp” and “Pwp” were used.
For non-valid readers: In Walisian there is “twp” for “duff” and “pwp” for “Aa”.
A member of the National Assembly of the Plaid Cymru Party said that the whole group had “not been happy” and had proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was closed against the change of names, but pointed to the great similarity between “MWP” and “Muppet”.
In this context, the Walisian letter w is spoken in the English language spoken in Yorkshire, like the letter u.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly), which is currently drafting legislation for amendments, said: "The final decision on names for members of the National Assembly is of course with the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Valais National Assembly to change its names.
In June the Group published the results of a public hearing on the proposals from which broad support for the name ‘Wellsh Parliament’ for the National Assembly was made available.
With regard to the title of the national assembly members, the ‘Well Parliamentary Members’ or ‘WMPs’ group preferred the ‘MWP’ option for the largest support in public hearing.
The members of the National Assembly seem to offer alternative options, but the ring of consensus for President Elin Jones, who is to present a draft law within weeks, could present a problem.
The Law on Reform will include further amendments to the working methods of the National Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of members of the National Assembly and the establishment of the Committee system.
The members of the National Assembly may finally vote on their name in their debate on the law.
Macedonians voted in a referendum on a change in the name of the country
The voters decide on Sunday whether the name of their country should be changed in the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The referendum was set up to contribute to a decade-long battle with the neighbouring Greece, which has a province with the same name Macedonia.
Athens has long been saying that the name of its northern neighbours means that this claim is raised in the Greek area and has repeatedly spoken against its accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opposition to the referendum on the change of names, said he would not accept the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in names is the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's weak in view of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“The old people whom I spoke to, in the past, gave a bar and a church to every corner of the earth,” said Adam.
"Today there are no more."
He said the removal of the bar would be complete.
"People's social life looks different today," he said.
"Only the living room of the neighborhood is no longer in which the people are regularly found."
He fears that the money from the sale of assets does not last as long as the church leaders accept, and that they will “be at the beginning sooner or later”.
The church, he added, could be replaced by apartments with properties in which people who do not support the remaining places of access.
"The overwhelming majority of the people who buy property dwellings in these buildings will be white," he said, "and in order to speed up the complete closure of these churches, it is unlikely that most of the people who enter these property dwellings will become members of these churches."
Both churches were created by white communities before Harlem became a black Metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white methodist community emerged in the 1930s.
A black community, whose service to God was nearby, became owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken from a black community under Reverent John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of individual dealers in 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem that refused to install or support blacks.
At a fire in 1939, the building was badly damaged, but as Johnson's community members planted the reconstruction, they ordered the bell game.
Reverent David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, called the bell game "the bells of the poor".
The expert who listened to the bell game in July used other words: “A culturschatz” and “an invaluable historical instrument”.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell game ever played worldwide, played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind. This was changed to the largest bell game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced by St. Martin's.
What has been played in St. Martin's in recent months is a complicated story with architects and contractors who have been drawn to the church's lay leaders and to the Bishop's diocese.
In July, the Community Presidency, the Community’s lead-in-chief body of directors, expressed written thoughts against the Diocese that the Dioceses would try to extend the costs to the Community Presidency, although they were not involved in the transmission of the architects and contractors sent by the Diocese.
Some members of the Community complained about lack of transparency on the sides of the diocese.
Hai injured in California 13-year-olds when they were baptized by Lobster
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster season, after official statements, a 13-year-old boy hit Hai at the baptism of Lobster.
The attack took place just 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the sender of KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been with friends for about half an hour in the morning when he heard the boy's help cry and went with several others to help him get him out of the water.
Hammel said he had first thought the young man was happy to have caught a thief. But then he realized that the young man cried: “I have been eaten!
I'm hungry!"
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he found that his entire keystone had been locked up.
“I write that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There is a hai in the water!’ added Hammel.
The young man was fled to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in a critical state.
The type of hais responsible for the attack was not known.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles said to the media that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks ago. However, it was concluded that it was not about a dangerous horse.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Officials stopped access to Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 horses in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's plant Prefecture on the cosmetic market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's works with cosmetics that are equipped with specialized assistants, boats, superdrugs and Devenhams.
Within the framework of a large presidential board of 2.8 billion British money, the cosmetic market in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow, as fashion and budget estimates go back, will be tested in eleven branches. If they prove successful, they will be extended to other branches in the next year.
The investment in cosmetics comes together with the search for the supermarkets as soon as possible, prior to the use of charging areas used for television devices, microwaves and household appliances.
According to Sainsbury's data, the volume of its cosmetics ranges for the first time to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Twozerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Previous series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also receive more space and brand areas like those in businesses like boats.
In addition, the Supermarket runs a relaunch of its "bootique" making series so that most of the products are vegan-friendly – a aspect that is increasingly called for by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume trader Fragrance Shop will be tested in two Sainsbury's sales sites. The first sale site was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and a second will be opened in the next year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to daily buying small quantities of food in local supplies business means that supermarkets need to do more to allow customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsburys, sales are increasingly viewed as buying houses, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight more services and non-food articles against the discounter Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has established hundreds of Argos and Habitats companies two years ago and has also established a number of Habitats sales sites. This has increased food prices and the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the Supermarket to reorganise its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments was broken.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000s, but after a presentation of the distribution of revenue from the branches of the drug dealer in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the sale of Sainsbury's 281 branches of pharmaceuticals to Celesio, the owner of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million British pounds three years ago.
The company indicated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan when an extended palette with luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, is added in four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the sales director at Sainsburys, said: “We have redesigned the display of our cosmetics to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in dedicated colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand pallet is cut down on all needs. Due to the disturbing environment and the affordable locations, we are now an attractive target for cosmetics purchases that demand the previous type of purchase."
Peter Jones, after the return of Holly Willoughbys from a business worth 11 million British pounds
The "Dragons" star Peter Jones is "noble", after TV moderator Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a business worth 11 million British pounds with his lifestyle company to focus on their new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homeware and accessories brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared with Gwyneth Paltrows Mark Goop.
The “This Morning” Moderator, 37, announced her return on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby drew “Dragons’ The” Star Peter Jones through her extremely short-term return from her luxury lifestyle company to focus on their new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones should have been "good" when the Golden Girl of the TV on a busy day conversation at the centre of his business seminar in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, gave, because of their new business – at the value of up to 1.5 million British pounds – the common homeware and accessories market Truly no longer has enough time to spend.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Marke Goop and would probably double the property of Willoughbys valued by 11 million British pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her return from Truly to Instagram, Jones left Britain on his way to a holiday.
One source said: “Truly had the highest priority for Holly.
It should ensure for them long-term future over the next decades.
Her decision to withdraw was totally surprising for all the participants.
No one could believe what happened on the Tuesday, so shortly before the market was introduced.
In the capital in Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the return of the “This Morning” Moderator, which belongs to the most promising star in the United Kingdom, could cost the company, due to high investment in products of cheeses and candles, to clothing and homeware and possibly more delays in market introduction.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Cap, and Jones, 52, became president in March.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a share of 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to be a brand messenger for M&S and to replace Ant McPartlin as the Moderator of the ITV transmission "I'm A Celebrity".
A Jones near source said last night: "We do not comment on his business affairs."
Hard words "and then we fell in love"
He was concerned about the criticism he had received from the media for a comment that some would consider "not presidential" and expected for such positive comments about the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given so much?
Trump said that the voice of a news moderator followed:
"I didn't give up."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, since the first meeting in Singapore was awarded in June of Trump as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the denuclearisation negotiations have been put in stock.
Over three months after the summit in Singapore in June, Ri Yong Ho, the top North Korean diplomat, said on Saturday against politicians from all over the world, according to the UN General Assembly, that the North did not see the US's “agreed response” in North Korea.
Instead, he established that the US had imposed sanctions on the press.
Trup showed himself to be a very optimistic in his field of customer service.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We were facing a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve Kim's relationship showed positive results: the end of the rocket attack, support for the release of hostages and the return of the remaining U.S. military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about Kim's relationship.
"It is so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside and trying to get back into this crowded Arena, about 200 people would be here," said Trump, pointing directly at the crowd.
Tsunami and Earthbeds in Indonesia provide an island and cost hundreds of lives
After the earthquake of Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were said they would not be needed.
Although over 10 per cent of the population of Lombok were displaced, no national emergency was declared a prerequisite for the mobilization of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have made it very clear in many cases that they do not require international support, which is therefore something difficult," said Sumbung.
While saving the children together a team to travel to Palu, it is still not sure whether foreign workers can work in front of the place.
Sutopo, speaker of the disaster protection authority, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu whether international bodies should participate in the aid measures.
In view of the earthquakes with which Indonesia has to fight constantly, the country is still prepared as unfortunately ill on natural forces.
While in Aceh Tsunami protected areas, these are not a day-to-day approach to other coastal areas.
Despite an apparent lack of warning in Palu, the warning in force has probably contributed to the deaths.
Travel between many islands of Indonesia is already a challenge in the optimal case.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A Lazarusret ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of land-use victims is headed for Palu, but the location of the new disaster will be reached within three days.
President Joko Widodo has improved the associated Indonesian infrastructure for the core of his election campaign and has raised enough money for roads and roads.
The next year, however, the government of the Joko seeking re-election leads to funding deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure through persistent confessions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes and apartments when bands of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with masks, rifles and bows and other primitive weapons.

The number of deaths of the tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832
The number of the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the disaster protection authority on Sunday morning.
Many people should be trapped in the drummers of buildings, which, through the quake of strength 7.5 from the Friday, which had been opened up to six meters high waves, reported by the authorities at a press conference Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was moved with the drummers of single-survival buildings.
Police arrested a man, 32 for murder, after a woman was shot
After finding a woman like this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 in Grayson Mews in John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police call on the residents to report if they have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is in an early phase, but I ask everyone who has stayed close to John Street in Birkenhead to see or hear anything suspicious about us.
In addition, I invite all the people, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken something from a Dashcam, to contact us. They may also have information that is of utmost importance for our investigation."
A police speaker confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
Today's afternoon are friends who believe the woman to be able to meet at Tatorto to discover where she was found this morning.
The investigations were under way, and the police told them that they were going to inform the next members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment, but the police informed him that no one could enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
The residents are now informed that it will take hours until they can enter the building again.
It was heard as a police officer told a man that now the whole area is being treated as tatort.
A woman appeared in trains dissolved at the place of the event.
It repeats again and again, "that's so scary."
At 14:00 a.m., there were two police vehicles inside the car and another vehicle before they were fired.
Under the ban, several police officers were stationed to monitor the housing block.
Persons who have information will be asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC to call number 101 or apply anonymously to criminals under number 0800 555 111 and refer to protocol entry 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell State before Parliament will be the newest subject of the battle on the change of history.
Its binding would be poetic justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious works of art in England by its fanatic Puritan allies.
The Cromwell Society, however, described the Cricks proposal as “tourity” and “try to re-write the history”.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of statues it was inevitable that the image of Oliver Cromwell before the Palace of Westminster became the target.
The image tower in the English Civil War was neither organized nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would be offered for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycrofts is a wonderful representation of Cromwell as evidence of the opinion and part of the historical writing of a figure that is still worth many.
Goldsmith said regarding the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell will be protected by many, perhaps by the end of the 19th century more than today, as someone who viewed Parliament against pressure outside, in his case, of course by the monarchy.
Whether it is a fully appropriate representation is the subject of continued historical debate.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is a unique figure that represents a side of this scourge.
Its services as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating them and remembering them."
Killer's wine belongs to Chinese farmers
Following local media reports, a farmer in a market in the southwestern China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The man, to whom only the name “Yuan” was named, was found with an overcrowded blood stream near a Swiss market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, a Swedish builder is ready to inject Swine vaccines.
He then sent reports on Wednesday with his cousin from the nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door was open to a nearby swimming pool.
He said in the chair there was a large male pig with blood on the snow.
According to the report, a federal investigation confirmed that the 250 kilograms of heavy wine had touched the farmers.
"The legs of my cousins were blue and dark," the cousin, named after the nickname "Wu", was quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Taking a security camera showed how Yuan delivered the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the Swine had been arrested to prevent attacks on other people while the police collected evidence at Tatort.
Yuan's family and the market authorities deal with reports of a compensation for his death.
It is rare that Swine people are attacked, but such cases are known.
In 2016 a woman and her husband were arrested on her farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290 kilo of heavy wine planted a Walisian farmer between himself and a tractor until the farmer's wife was able to feed the animal.
After a farmer was released in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said against CBC News that Swine would normally not be aggressive, but the taste of blood could be as a “exhaler”.
"They're just funny.
They're very curious and they're not going to hurt anyone.
You only have to deal with it with the right degree of respect," he said.
The rest of Hurrikan Rosa brings widespread strong rivers in the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurrikan Rosa weakens on the way over the colder water on the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will be brought out of rain forests in North Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
On Sunday at 5:00 o'clock east coast, Rosa showed wind speeds of 136 km/h, which corresponds to a hurricane of category 1 and is 620 km west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will arrive in the north on Sunday.
In the middle of the Pacific, a troupic troupe is being formed that leads to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa arrives on Monday as a tropical storm, high tropical humidity is transported to the north of the United States.
Rosa will be released on Monday in parts of Mexico up to 25 centimetres.
Then, tropical humidity is produced in the coming days by interactions with the rising tide of strong rainfall in the south-west.
Local, 2.5 to 10 centimetres can cause dangerous fluttery overflows, water flowing protection and possibly soil debris in the desert.
High tropical humidity leads to low rates of nearly 5 to 7.5 centimetres per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the south-west, in particular in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimetres are expected to fall.
Due to the stress of tropical rainfall, there is the possibility of fluttering overflows with rapidly worsening conditions.
In view of the disturbing tropical lowlands, it is urgent to walk into the desert.
Strong downwards can lead to rising streams from Canyons, and winds bring local wind bubbles as well as wind that leads to dust.
The nearby Trog brings locally strong rain in parts of the coast of South California.
It is possible that total droplets of more than one centimetre can lead to a small volume of water flowing protection and smooth roads.
This would be the first drop in rain time in this region.
The first combined tropical raindrops reach Arizona on Sunday and Monday. On Monday and Tuesday, it is spreading.
On Tuesday, strong rain spreads into the Four-Corners region and stops the Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature changes are possible throughout the United States, as the Arctic cools, while the troops remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday, in the middle of the United States, there is a good example of a dramatic temperature difference.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the next days, the continued summer heat is trying to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the middle and east of the United States, a warm beginning of October is expected at 27 °C from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast points to a high likelihood of excessive temperatures in the first half of October in the east of the United States.
Over 20 million visitors have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million viewers have seen on Thursday at six television networks the shocking statements of the Supreme Court named Brett Kavanaugh and the woman Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political situation continued. On Friday, the television operators interrupted their regular program because of a change in the last minute: an agreement by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, to conduct a weekly investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate's Justice Committee against being 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, she was pregnant and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in an arbitrary statement that he was 100% sure that this wasn't happening.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million visitors reported by Nielsen have seen the audience.
The company reported the average number of visits to CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which had broadcast the hearing, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen has a general problem with measuring attendance in offices.
To turn this into the right perspective: This corresponds to the number of visitors in a play-off football game or in the Oscar league.
The sender Fox News Channel, whose minor-oriented moderators strongly support the appointment of Kavanaughs, reported that Nielsen, with an average of 5.69 million audiences of the daily listening, recorded the highest number of all networks.
ABC came with 3.26 million visitors to second place.
CBS had reported that Nielsen 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million visitors.
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the drama from Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican had published a statement to which he would therefore vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on Friday morning by CNN and CBS, as protesting him at the railway station on the way to a hearing of the Justice Committee with loud voices.
He stood for a minute with a slight look, while he was shot. The scene was transferred live to CNN.
"I stand right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you believe he tells the truth to the country?"
"They have power, while so many women are free," said one woman.
Flake said that his office had published a statement and added before the railway station concluded that he would have to say more when listening to the Committee.
All cable and circuit networks sent hours later live when the Justice Committee should vote on the continuation of the appointment of Kavanaughs to vote on the whole Senate.
Flake said, however, that he would do this only under the condition that the FBI, like the democratic minority, will investigate the charges against the candidates in the next week.
Flake is partly convinced by interviews with a friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an argument with Coons and subsequent different senators, Flake made his decision.
The decision was of great importance, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has conducted a FBI investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of using Brexit for political purposes
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the European Union of using the future of Britain for political purposes and undermining the interests of the nation in an interview with the newspaper Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will meet on September 29, 2018 at the part of the Conservative Party in Birmingham.
In addition to the interview with her on the newspaper titled another interview, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson intensified his attack on its so-called "Checkers Plan" for Brexit by calling it a proposal that foresees the mutual intervention of debts by Britain and the EU as "complete absurd".
Killing shots on Wayde Sims: Police take suspicious Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of the LSU player
The police have found a suspect in connection with the killings on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested after being reported by the Baton Rouge police.
The authorities published video recordings of the connection between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the battle.
As the CBS partnership station WAFB reported, the police assured the mirror at Tatort and said that Simpson's DNA was found on the bridge.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police told him he had the killer shots on Wayde.
The lawyer reports that the charge has been fixed at US$ 350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's office published a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a shot at the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the technical lab of the federal police, the Southern University Police and the citizens in the area for their support in the investigation leading to arrest.
LSU Sport Director Joe Alleva thanked the regional enforcement authority for "their concern and their efforts for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98 m large flying player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for the LSU basketball.
In the last season, he achieved an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach, Will Wade, said the team was "deeply shocked" and "sucked under shock".
"You're always worried about something like that," said Wade.
Vulcan sprays ass on Mexico City.
The southern quarter of the Mexican capital, Vulcan Popocatepetl, which came out of the Asche.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity had taken place in the crater, and within 24 hours 183 gas and asches were registered.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of throats and seizures.
Images in social media showed thin asches on the windscreens of cars in four quarters of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysikers, since September 2017 had struck a earthquake of 7.1 central Mexico, found increased activity on the 72 km southeastern corner of the capital.
The Vulkan, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Consequences between police and Catalan separatists prior to the anniversary of the independence agreement
In Barcelona, six persons were arrested on Saturday after meetings between the preparation police and the Pro-Independency demonstrators. Thousands participated in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarized independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro separatists, held back by the preparation police, kept them with eggs and other colored powders, thus creating dark dust clouds in the streets normally populated with tourists.
During the next day, it also came to work with the police, who used their shells to slow down the fighting.
Several hours ago, the Pro-Independency Group "No Forget, No Forgiveness" was scheduled to be called "Long Living Spain" while the Unionists opposed them.
As the local press reported, 14 people were treated for minor injuries in the protests.
However, one year after the referendum of 1 October, which was celebrated by Madrid as illegal by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very tense.
The electors had decided with an overwhelming majority for independence, although the electoral participation was low, since the opposition voted mostly in favour of the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in the last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in violent conflicts before the elections.
Pro-independence groups had campaigned on Friday night in the open to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it was forced to take another way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the protest of the separatists, said he saw the prospects that Catholics would achieve independence no longer hope.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents laugh before joy because they could choose, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite an important fact, even though few, in the last December regional elections, the Catalan Pro-Independency Parties had difficulties in maintaining the momentum of this year. Many of their most well-known leaders are either in exile or in port where they are waiting for their procedures because of their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said that the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
"The situation gets more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catholic leaders who have been in charge of the investigation since the end of the last year, announced his candidate for election to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for the European elections, it is the best opportunity to start the development of democratic values and oppression by the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonerry: Men arrested after the car house was destroyed
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry was destroyed several times by a car.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 p.m. after British summer.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the towers and buildings were damaged themselves.
In addition, it may have been shot at the car with a hammer.
Menga-treffer means for Livingstone 1:0-Siege over Rangers
Dolly Mengas first tower for Livingstone guaranteed victory.
The raised Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the first second download for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Wareins.
Dolly Mengas meter proved to be decisive that Gary Holt's men were able to get along with Hibernian in the second half of his life.
Gerrard's men will remain unexplained in the Premiership in this season and will be against the hearts of the eight points the next Sunday.
The rangers are first on Thursday in Europe League guests for Rapid Vienna.
Livingston can, in the meantime, increase his victory series in the division to six games, which means that the Chief Coach Holt has not registered any download since his acquisition by Kenny Miller in the last month.
Livingston prefers chances against instant playful guests
Holts team had to be in charge long before the hit, as its direction put the rangers in front of the various problems.
Scott Robinson passed, however, and became slower before the gate. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot a little further after he was shot here to meet Craig Halkett's head in front of the gate.
The guests were pleased to let the rangers play ahead, as they knew they could stop the guests in standard situations.
In this way, the decision-making court came to a stand.
The Rangers set up a free zone, and Livingston prepared a chance to bring the Declan Gallagher and Robinson together to the corner. This opened the door with a ball contact from the middle of the street.
In this phase the Rangers had dominated the Ball possession, but could not overcome the reverse of the host, and Torhüter Liam Kelly remained largely unsatisfied.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos Kelly once was forced to reverse.
Scott Pittman was fired by the Rangers Tower Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow took the ball out of another standard situation of Livingstone.
Flankes were again caught in Livingstone’s punishment and were regularly taken out of the danger zone, while two required punishments – one from Halket against the interchanged Glenn Middleton and one because of the game – were rejected.
"Phenomenal" by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingstone.
They were extremely excellent and were overextended at this stage.
Their toys and their team have not changed since their return to the top team, but Holt deserves great praise for the way he has raised the team since his arrival.
There were so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led to an excellent organized revolution, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall held on the track during the entire game.
The rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
So well they were under Gerrard at the same time, they couldn't reach this standard.
Her last ball was insufficient – only once they were able to pass through the host's men, and this is just like a weekend call for the rangers that are in the middle of the table.
Receive Erdogan with mixed reactions in the hills
On Saturday (September 29th) light faces and blue sky shine when the government's superintendents of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to repair relations between NATO allies.
There were disputes on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and the EU's accession to Turkey.
Next, Erdogan traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is the home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called security grounds for a 25,000 strong number of people to be gathered before the mosque. However, many of the prisoners were close to seeing their presidents.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators — many of them Kurds – also became listeners. They condemned earthly politics as well as the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The opposite protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, which is recognized by some Germans as hero and is admired by others as autocrats.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Motorcycler dies in combination with car
In a meeting with a car, a driver came about to live in London.
The meeting took place about 10:15 a.m. of British summer time near the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a road of traffic in Deptford, south of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and Healthiers cared about the man who died in the accident.
A month before the accident, another driver was in an accident with a driver's plane in the Children's Street, about 1.6 kilometers away from the accident on Saturday to come to life.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and inform his closest members.
Road brakes and coaches are set up, and car drivers have been told to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin prison: Six officers injured in disturbances
According to the Prison Office, six prison officers were injured in a high-security prison for men.
On Sunday, about 9:30 a.m. of British summer time in HMP Long Larsin in Worcestershire and still stop.
Specialized "Tornado" officers were invited to stop the disturbances involving eight persons and limited to a flight.
The officers were treated locally for minor injuries.
A speaker from the Prison Service said: “It was used to deal with a more persistent incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we want to clarify that the police officers will be handed over and perhaps spend a long time behind the gates."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison officer was treated after an attack by a prison in the hospital.
In October last year, staff members were called into prison to face severe disturbances in which the staff were attacked with pool waves.
Hurrikan Rosa poses a threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with fluttery overwhelmings (may be benefiting remote areas)
It is rare that a tropical depression will reach Arizona, but that is exactly what will likely take place next week when the rest of Hurrikan Rosa take over the south-west of the desert and bring with it the risk of fluttering overflows.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of floating overwhelmings from the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, as well as south of California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa approaches the mountain floor with rain and goes directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported in a tweet that “only ten tropical cycles have been nearing a tropical storm or a tropical depression of Phoenix up to 200 kilometres since 1950!
Katrina (1967) is located as a Hurrikan within 64 kilometres from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimetres of the Netherlands with a combined range of up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rome of Arizona.
In other areas of the south-west, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, are likely to be 2.5 to 5 centimetres and can be combined up to 10 centimetres.
For those who do not have the risk of fluttering overflows, there can be a blessing because of the doors in the region associated with Rosa.
Although overwhelming is of great concern, this rain is likely to be useful in part, as it is now ruling in the south-west of Durre.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona's minimum extreme doors are on top of the second highest category," reported weather.com.
First, the path of the Hurrican means that Rosa will meet on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
In the morning, Rosa will still have hurricanes with maximum winds of 136 kilometres per hour and will be located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. The hurricane will then take 19 kilometers per hour north.
In the Pacific, the storm will be encountered on colder waters, and it will slow down.
It is therefore expected that Rosa will meet in Mexico on Monday or evening with the strength of a tropical storm on the ground.
The low levels may occur in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of overheating.
“From Baja California to the north-west of the Sonora West, low drop is expected from 7.5 to 15 centimetres, where it is possible to reach 25 centimetres,” reported weather.com.
Next, Rosa will be taken as a tropical storm in northern Mexico, on the early Tuesday as a tropical depression, reach the border to Arizona, and then, until later, by Arizona, to the south of Utah.
"As a major threat to Rosa or her remnants are expected to be very strong downhills in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora West and the south-west of the USA," the National Hurricane Center reported.
As a result of these declines, life-threatening fluctuations in the desert are expected to take place and in the waters of three-way protection as well as in mountainous areas of soil.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
After the foundation of a 16-year-old with stichwunds in Somerset, three boys were arrested at the age of ten and a 20-year-old man under the suspicion of the attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured on Saturday at 4:00 a.m. in the British summer season in the Excelsior-Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was brought to a hospital, and his condition is "stable".
According to the Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old man and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area.
The officials ask everyone who has records of the events on a mobile phone to register.
Trup said that Kavanaugh had been “under the community, the forest” of the Democrats.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the unhindered and unheard of tactics of the Democrats," Trup said at a customer gathering in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trup said that Kavanaugh had looked “under the community, the forest” of the Democrats during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh said on Thursday before the Congress and showed Christine Blasey Ford's charge back, he had them sexually abused decades ago as both teenagers.
Ford also said when listening to her complaint.
The president said on Saturday that the American people had seen the brightness, the quality and courage of Kavanaugh this day.
"A voice for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal heads of our time, a lawyer with an excellent balance in the service of the public," he said.
The President directly addressed the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the inter-elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important choices in our life.
I don't get involved, but I actually get involved," he said.
"I therefore fight for great candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the Democrats see their mission in it, "to deliver and block."
The first important procedural vote on the appointment of Kavanaughs is expected to take place on Friday at the Senate, said a senior GOP leader against CNN.
Hundreds killed on Earth in Indonesia, increase rates of surrender
According to the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people were killed. Many of them were drowned as a result of a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people were gathered on Friday at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu, when, at the outbreak of darkness, up to six meters high waves flew over the beach and many people fell to death and all that was going on their way was destroyed.
The Tsunami was a quake of 7.5 strength.
"As the threat from Tsunami arose yesterday, people still went to the beach and did not immediately find out about it, and they fall to the victim," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, speaker of the Indonesian disaster protection authority BNPB at a conference in Jakarta.
"The Tsunami didn't come alone, he washed cars, trees and houses, he found everything on the ground," Nugroho said. He added that the Tsunami was taken at a speed of 800 km/h over the open sea before he hit the coast.
Some people were on the run before Tsunami was dressed on trees and had survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated and accommodated in 24 centres in Palu.
A number of damaged buildings and shops, abandoned and damaged bridges, as well as a water-contained mosque, have been published by the disaster protection authority.
On Saturday, the coastal town was hit by further babysitters.
The earth’s series was to inspire 2.4 million people in one area.
The Indonesian authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the nuclear bombs fired at Hiroshima during the massive wave of energy released from the day.
Because of the location of the city at the end of a long, small book, Tsunami could have become larger, the authorities said.
Nugroho described the damage as “absorbed” and pointed out that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels would be destroyed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found under the drummers of single buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 were lost.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damages along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in a area called Dondhia, which is closer to the epicenter of the bee.
The communication with Dodrea was completely closed by Nugrohos words, and it did not provide any information.
According to a statement of the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its employees and volunteers are on their way to the areas concerned.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," said the statement.
On Saturday, the authorities were often criticized for not informing them that a Tsunami Palu had been hit, although the waves reached official data at the time of the warning.
Amateur captures published in social media show a man at the top of a building's roof, who suspects people on the street before Tsunami nears.
Within minutes, a water wall is lifted on the floor and cools buildings and cars from there.
Reuters could not verify the accuracy of the recordings immediately.
Through the bees and Tsunami, there was a massive explosion that interrupted the communication around Palu and called on the authorities to coordinate the rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send cargo tools with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuaters still need urgent food and other vital goods.
The airport of the city remained closed until October and was reopened only for aid measures.
For Sunday a visit was planned by President Joko Widodo in evacuation centers in Palu.
The number of tsunami victims has increased to over 800.
The situation is very bad.
The workers of World Vision from Dodhea have certainly achieved the city of Palu, in which the staff are transferred to the inner courtyard of their office, but they have gone through the words of Dosebas on the road to the scene of destruction.
"They told me they had seen many damaged houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the relief groups began with the hard task of putting the disaster relief aid in place, some monitored that professional foreign aid on the journey would be prevented from coming to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and personnel from abroad are only possible when the location of an accident has been declared to the national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“At the moment it is still a disaster on provincial level,” said Aulia Ariani, speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'okay, this is a national disaster', we can accept international support.
During the second night since the earthquake and the tsunami of the day over Palu, friends and family members of the still missing ones were hoping for one of the marvels of the tragic stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a small boy was taken from a water channel.
On Sunday, rescue forces released a woman who had been buried two days below the corpse of her mother.
Gendon Subbannon, the trainer of the Indonesian Paragliding National Mission, had trained two of the missing paraglidders for the beginning of this month in Indonesia to the end of Asian games.
Others who were arrested in the Roa-Roa hotel, as Mandiya had done, were his students.
"As an senior in Paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told us how in the hours after the message from the founder of the Roa-Roa hotel was being circulated among the paragliders, whatsApp had sent to the combatants from Palu who participated in the beach party.
His messages, however, led to rather than to blue holes, only to grey frescoes.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Diebe steal 26.750 US dollars while filling a cash machine in Newport on the Level
According to a press release from Newport police in Newport on the Level Diebe, a Brink's employee was charged with filling up an automatic US dollar 26.750.
The driver of the vehicle had taught a cash machine in the maintenance complex and wanted to earn more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was employed, “a man came after the employee of Brink’s” and stole a bag full of money that was fixed for the automatics.
According to the press release, Witnesses saw several suspects fled from the tator, but the police did not tell how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons who have information on the identity of suspects will be asked to contact the Newport police under 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name – in Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The being formally known as Kanye West” (The official being known as Kanye West).
West, 41, has been using the title Ye for a while and has used it as the title of its eight albums published in June.
The change takes place at Saturday Night Live, where the publication of his new album “Yandhi” is expected.
It takes place in the consignment as substitute for singer Ariana Grande, which, according to the manufacturer's statement, has said "emotional reasons".
The word is not only a short summary of its current professional name, but it has a religious significance for the West, according to its own statement.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most frequently used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘du’,” said West this year in a conversation about his album with Radio Moderator Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
From Kanye, which means “the only” was “Yes” – simply a reflection of our good, our evil, our insult, of everything.
The album reveals more about what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who worked with the West in the past, has also written his name with and without binding and capital letters.
Mexico AMLO believes not to use the military against the civilian population
The elected Mexican President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, agreed to never use military violence against the civilian population, during the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression against students in his country.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza, "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, soldiers had set fire to a peaceful demonstration on the scene and killed 300 people. At this time, left-wing students were moving to establish themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador agreed to support young Mexicans through monthly assistance for students and the opening up of further free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training had led to young criminal gangs.
US should double financial resources for artificial intelligence
In view of the enhanced activities of China in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its research expenditure in this area, says Investor and KI-Fu Lee, who was active at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow on KI announcements of various areas of the US government, even though the US generally lacks a formal KI strategy.
In the meantime, China submitted its plan in the last year: the country intends to reach No 1 in the area of KI innovation by 2030.
"The duplication of the budget for the KI research would be in view of the fact that all other countries are so far behind the United States, a good start. We are looking for the next KI outbreak," said Lee.
The duplication of financial resources could double the chances that the next great success of KI in the United States would be achieved, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent KI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at the Carnegie Mellon University on a KI system that visited the top American Othello players. Later he was leading leadership at Microsoft Research and President of Google's new release in China.
Lee praised former U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked after the time of the next competition, since he wanted to help identify the next viewers.
According to read words, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain state subsidies.
"Not China takes the academic top forces away, but the companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have set up in recent years the cover series of universities to work on KI.
In the light of the opinion, an amended US immigration policy could also be beneficial for the US KI movements.
"I think that people promoted in the KI should be offered Greencards automatically," he said.
In July 2017, China State Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of KI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to read words, the National Natural Science Foundation of China finances people on academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations spend money on US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
In the beginning of this year, the US Department of Defence founded the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which was supposed to be involved in the partnership from industry and science. Furthermore, the White House announced the formation of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced this month the investment of 2 billion US dollars in the “AI Next” initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than $100 million in KI research each year.
In the meantime, US legislation on the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has done nothing for months.
Macedonians voted in referendum on a change in the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia agreed in a referendum on whether the name of the country should be changed in the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would be a decade old conflict with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbours means that this claim is raised in the Greek territory, which is why Greece has introduced a Veto against Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
However, in June both governments concluded an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name. Nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum. A Boycott campaign is in doubt that the electoral participation is 50 per cent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the vote list was: "Are you a member of NATO and the EU by adopting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, to which Prime Minister Zoran Zaev argues that Macedonia, one of the countries that have been brought out of the Yugoslavia summit, is worth the price for inclusion in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the screen of the European Union, as this means a secure life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, many Members have said that they would stick to the outcome so that it is decisive.
The amendment would require a bilateral majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said it did not report irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, only 16 per cent of the electoral participation was compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, with 66 per cent of the registered voters voting.
"I am here because of my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a elector in Skopje’s capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko will give their vote on 30 September 2018 in Struca, Macedonia, on the change in the name of the country, which would open the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage before the Parliament in Skopje and presented chairs in front of cells that were set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we would like to contribute to higher priorities, not through interference," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we will.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonians, we can use others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will result in urgently needed investments for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that a large majority will be for this because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
According to his words, a "yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would participate in the referendum. This number is below the required electoral participation.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian sender Telma TV found that 57 percent of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said they would vote with "Yes".
For the referendum to be successful, the electoral participation must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
A shadow of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the probationary government since its adoption in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City maneuvered through the entire Bridgeton tour to reach the tower
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crossed the bridge at 2:0 from Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero left his encounter in the 65s. Minutes look easy.
The Argentinian attacker received a passage in the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He raced between three Brighton players and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green triangles.
He played around a champion here and then won several more defenders at the border of the Brighton prison.
Next he took a step left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the discipline room to play the ball back to Aguero, who was overrun with his right sword Brighton-to-peer Matthew Ryan and shot at the right side of the network.
"Aguero struggles with problems in his feet," said the City Manager Pep Guardiola against reporters.
“We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were happy that he had reached a gate right now."
However, it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League Duell.
This tower fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball at this train far away on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good foot pass along the left wing of Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a couple of trains to control Sterling to a long corner.
The Sky Blues Angreefer aimed the ball into the network shortly before he stepped in.
City plays at the Championships League team on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhine-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hopenheim.
The screensaver wants to stop the game
Since the nationals have been expelled from the Playoff competition, there was little reason to force another use.
However, the ever-increasing painter hopes to stand against the Colorado Rockies on the hill on Sunday, only if this is relevant to the Rockies that have a game in the West before the Los Angeles Dodgers, for the playoffs.
The Rockies achieved at least a wild card with a 5nd victory over the Nationals on Friday, but still wanted to secure their first division title.
“Although we can play nothing, we can at least play because we know the atmosphere in the audience here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that I would encounter this year.
Why should I not take part in this competition?"
The nationals have not yet announced a start-up for Sunday, but they are reluctant to let the players shoot in such a situation.
Schersers, for whom the 34th term would be used as start-up players, spent Thursday in the bullpens and would blow on his normal day of rest on Sunday.
The Washington Lawyer has shown a statistics of 18-7 this season, an ERA of 2,53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 inches.
Trip stops customer service in West Virginia
The President addressed the situation directly in relation to Brett Kavanaugh, elected by him for the Supreme Court, when he spoke of the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the inter-elections.
“All we have done is on the game in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important choices in our life.
That's one of the big, big – I don't start, but I actually start, so I fight for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take the power again with all the means, you see the community, the commitment.
It is not for them who hurt them, who must pass them over to receive power and control, that is what they want, power and control, we will not give them."
The Democrats, he said, saw their mission, "to deliver and block."
"And you see that in the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "with anger and jealousy and shame and dishonor."
He called the highest democracy in the Senate's Justice Committee, Senator Diane Feinstein, which issued Buhrufe's statement to the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document out?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for you one – that was really a bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen.”
Labour can no longer apply all opinions.
The party is intolerant of those who say their opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party agreed to call me back, this was a little bit surprising.
Finally, I am the last of a number of lab staff who are told that they are not welcome – just because we say what we think.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she had been energetically opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticised by the Tadel's order that I refer to another opinion as Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, of ironically on similar issues, of Jeremy with former top politicians was not an opinion.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday was that “the meetings should be inclusive and productive”.
Most of the free-for-charge GC meetings in my eight years were exactly that as a local labyrinth.
Unfortunately, most of the meetings today are not covered by this tone, and the promised “friendly, more comfortable” policy has been forgotten for a long time if it has already begun.
It is becoming more and more clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion will then be assessed whether it is accepted by the Party Party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a party leader. Ladies and gentlemen, whom I believed to share similar political views earlier, were now expected by me to make a return and take positions with which I would never have agreed otherwise – whether on national security or on the European internal market.
When I always speak publicly – while there is no role to what I say – there is a shift in social media that calls for me to start political media and says that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I'm not alone.
In fact, I know that I am better than some of my colleagues, because the comments that I have drawn to me are mostly political nature.
I admire the professionality and resolve of the colleagues who daily face a flood of sensitizing or racist practices and yet have not contributed very little.
One of the most disturbing aspects of this political era is that the changes have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn asked last week to promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we will no longer be able to apply all the opinions and the party will be more exorbitant by any mistrust and any change to the electoral rules.
In the last two years, I was often asked to put my head in the head and not to express my opinion so clearly, and then I would have "no problems".
But I didn't get involved in politics.
Since I was a student 32 years ago, because of the closure of the Thatcher government, because of my class room in the entire school, I have literally attended the Labour Party, I have fought for better public services for those who need it most – as a community director as well as as a cabinet minister.
I've never made a joke from my political views, nor at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could somehow be in ignorance about my political positions and areas where I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to the supporters of the Friday request: Given the fact that the country is being damaged by a Brexit, the budget, the company and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, I do not refer this message to Nottingham moment, but to my voters, whether they arelabour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that I will not cease to do so much of the horrors or political thoughts, in my opinion, to be the best interest of all of you.

Ayr vs Melrose 38:17: Undiscovered Ayr team stands at the top
Two later attempts may have failed something, but there is no doubt that Ayr has earned the victory in this extremely long-lasting game of the day in the Tenant's Premiership.
They are now the only ten men missing at the table.
Finally, the success of the household was to return to its previous vices as well as to its better chance rating, and Coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far, and we are still unhindered, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "A recognition for Ayr, they have valued their chances better than we."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was increased by Frazier Climo, led by Ayr. However, Melrose was able to win a prize card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been released for the game of the Warriors, and Jason Baggot got an unexplained attempt.
Climo built the leadership of Ayr with a punishment before he reached an accident directly to the middle of the day and then made an increased attempt in the allegation, so that it was at break 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose started the second half, however, well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, raised by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Next came a further interruption due to a serious injury of Ruardhi Knott, which was taken from the game field. After the continuation, Ayr built his premise through an increased attempt by Stafford McDowell.
Then, as captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson received a silver card, and at the end of a phase Melrose was able to pay the additional man for an unexplained attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the household came back, and as Sruan Hutchinson for Tackling without a ball against Climo, MacPherson obtained a yellow card from the street gas from a touchdown behind the outstanding Ayr package.
Climo grew as almost since the interruption, after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrongs Boxkick and Flenken Player Gregor Henry had sent out the fifth attempt by the household.
Still Game Star seems ready for new careers in the gastronomy
“Still Game” Star Ford Kieran seems to be ready for a change in the guest business after showing himself to be the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC send, whose books he writes and in which he plays one of the main trolleys together with his longtime Comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
The two announced that the front nine steps will be the last of the mission, and Kiernan seems to plan a life after Craiglong.
According to official records, he is the manager of the company of Affonymorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of the Scottish Sun claimed that Kiernan was interested in increasing "floating restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us": Bolivia, which is part of the country, hopes that a court will open its way to peace
Matrosen patrols in front of the beautiful marine capital in La Paz.
In public buildings, a multi-blue fence is built.
The motto is: “The sea is our legal property.
It's a duty to win back."
In Bolivia, which is part of a country, the memory of the resource lost in a bloody conflict in Chile in the 19th century is still as vivid as the desire to recycle the Pacific.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a judgment of the International Court of Justice to be held on 1 October following five-year consultations.
"Bolivia has the urge, a spirit of unity and tolerance, and looks forward to the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
In the country, many Bolivians are following the IGH’s judgment on large screens, hoping that the court will decide in the Hague for the benefit of Bolivia’s demand. According to this, Chile is obliged, after decades of sporadic talks, to negotiate a sovereign access to Bolivia to the sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic Indian president, who is in charge of a controversial fight for his election next year, is also very much at the trial on Monday.
"We are just about to return to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts feel it is unlikely that the court will decide for Bolivia's benefit and believe that this would change little.
The UN body, with its seat in the Netherlands, is not authorized to speak in Chilean territory, and has determined that it will not be decided on the outcome of the possible talks.
According to Páz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, that the case was “not complicated” after the closing of the IGH six months.
Far from supporting the Bolivian case, it could also mean a return in the last four years.
"The current Bolivian government has addressed the issue of access to the sea," Zárate said.
She pointed out that the Morales' military rhetoric has captured every remaining good Willen Chiles.
Bolivia and Chile will sometimes continue their discussions, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not replaced any messengers since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in the Hague, showed the view that the decision of the Court was unusual.
On Monday, Bolivia has "an extraordinary opportunity to introduce a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "preparate the conflicts of 139 years for mutual advantage," he said.
Calzadilla also argues that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – use the subject of the sea as a political circle.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access to the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to recognize that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says atomic detonation will only take place if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never release its nuclear weapons first if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to implement commitments made in Singapore during a summit between the Heads of State of the Rivers.
His remarks come at a time when U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo, more than three months after the summit with the North Korean State Chief Kim Young-un in Singapore, seems to be shortly ahead of taking the determined nuclear diplomacy back into effect.
Ri referred to the idea that further sanctions and the resistance of the US against a declaration of the end of the Korean war would always force the north into the knee, as a "Hergespinst".
Washington is skeptical and does not want the statement to be accepted without first taking essential steps to be taken by Pjungang.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
It is, however, a widely distributed masterpiece that Pjungjang seriously means to guarantee his safety with regard to an arsenal in which the country is likely to see the only possibility.
Pompeo plans a visit in Pjungjang for the next month to prepare a second match between Kim and Trump.
fashion shoes in Paris show the latest collections for huge head coverings that will be first available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your heat collection or completely shut down the sun, you don't have to look for it anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a palette of crazy head coverings for their 2019 summer collection, which fascinated the fashion world at the Paris fashion week.
Instagrams have only been transferred to this summer, and these designers have sent their visible creatures over the path.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagance coloured hat with a federal wide edge that just pressed the heads of the models.
As further dimensional accessories were shown with jewellery, a vacuum cleaner and even ananas. However, these are not intended to heat the head.
Tom Browne also filled a number of strange masks – just right on time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were painted with carved lips and had more similarities with Hannibal Lecter than with skin Couture.
A creation looked like a baptismal device, including a snowflake and a shower glasses, while another looked like a frozen egg.
And if you want to set another huge fashionstat, you're lucky.
Mode monitors predict that the huge head coverings can find their way into shopping streets near you.
The overdimensional heat follows directly on "La Bomba", the current heat with a width of 60 cm, which all carries from Rihanna to Emily Rattakowski.
The cult label behind the extremely unprofessional hat, which hit big waves in the social media, sent another big creation over the track: a beach bag of straw, which was almost as big as the model of a bath-adhesive model that held the bag.
The bast bag in red orange with bast francs and a white leather ring was the leading piece of Jacquemus' summer 2019 collection “La Riviera” at the Paris fashion week.
Prominent stylelist Luke Armitage said to F.C.: "I am prepared to be available for large heat and beach bags for the next summer in the shopping streets. The designer has been so excited that demand for over-dimensional accessorys will soon be ignored."
John Edward: Language Knowledge for World Citizens
The independent schools of Scotland continue to be characterized by academic excellence. This has continued with further outstanding results in 2018 and will be only underpinned by individual and joint success in the areas of sports, art, music and other Community enterprises.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools are then represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and wish to care for their students and their parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools pursue the goal of their students to further education and higher education, to prepare their choice and their place as world citizens.
As the education sector, which can design and implement a balanced learning plan, we see that modern languages are still popular and popular in schools as voters.
Nelson Mandela said: “When you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we cannot only be left in English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current results of this year's examination are that languages with the highest attendance rates are at the top of the range lists of independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages obtained notes A.
Of the above data from 74 SCIS member schools, 72% of students in Mandarin obtained notes in higher examinations, while 72% of students who learned German, 69% of students who learned French, and 63% of students who learned Spanish also reached notes A.
This suggests that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people in the future will undoubtedly be needed.
Languages today are also seen as electoral campaigns such as STEM (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the educational plans of independent schools and other institutions.
According to a UK Commission for Employment and Skills survey in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons for the problems that employers have mentioned in finding open jobs were related to a lack of language knowledge.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly needed when it comes to preparing young people for their future careers.
As more open places require languages, these knowledge is indispensable in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will benefit from such longevity in the future.
Directly able to communicate with people from other countries, multi-lingual people will automatically be given a priori to competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a maintenance, and French was spoken as the only language spoken by a two-thirds percentage (15 percent).
For this reason it is important for children today to invest in language education now.
Children who speak several languages, in particular those of developing countries, will have better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the most classic modern languages, while other languages will be taught, which will apply with a view to 2020 as the most important for the United Kingdom, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Where your child’s interests are always at the same time, independent schools will always have a number of languages with specialized teaching powers to choose.
Scottish independent schools commit themselves to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need for their success, as well as always the future.
At this time, in a global economic context, language can not be seen as even more important to the country’s future. Therefore, this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "international communication capacity".
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this opportunity, diversity and excellence.
You need to do it.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron before Lakers Debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see how LeBron James first appeared for the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait has come to an end soon.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton announced that James will be played on Sunday in the opening game of the pre-season against the denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he's gonna play, he's still not fixed.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is probably going to play only a few minutes.
In the beginning of this week James was asked after training for his plans for the six-game presage game plan of the Lakers.
"In this phase of my career, I don't need any presage games to prepare me," he said.
Time for Trumps Customer Service in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a number of electoral battles.
This is the first five of Trumps's planned customers for the next week, including well-being places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the strong vote on the confirmation of his election for the vacancy at the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the previous half-year data in November, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control over the Congress.
When does Trumps customer service take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trumps customer accommodation in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 (East coast time).
You can follow Trumps Customer Service in West Virginia below as Livestream at YouTube online.
Trump is likely to respond to the hearings of the board Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, for allegations of sexual misconduct that were conducted this week in exciting atmospheres. The pending Senate vote on the confirmation remains for up to one week in the Sweebe, while the FBI is conducting investigations.
However, the main objective of this series is to support Republicans who have to make a difficult choice in November.
Therefore, President Trump's election team told Reuters that these five customers would serve in the next week to “improve volunteers and supporters, while trying to obtain and build their majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives”.
"The control over the Congress is as important to its plans as possible for the President to travel to as many federal states as possible, while the busy electoral season is approaching," said a trumpet-computer who did not want to name his name, against Reuters.
According to West Virginia Metro News, at the customer service planned for tonight in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, "Ohio and Pennsylvania participate and report media from Pittsburgh".
The visit on Saturday is Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, the Federal State which he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to support the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey.
"There is no good sign for Morrisey that the President must come to try to get him involved in questioning," said Simon Haeder, politician at West Virginia University, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team is ready to fight in order to maintain the hope for the individual on Sunday
After three consecutive rounds, the four parties on Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The moving pendant of the moment is as a sport concept, but one that the players really believe, and that is especially in competitions like these.
Where is the moment of their opinion now?
“They put six points in charge, and now there are four, I think that this means a small moment for us,” Jordan Spieth said when leaving the place.
Europe is of course in favour and is four points ahead, while twelve further follow.
The Americans, however, say Spieth has some wind in their sails and have reason to feel at least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have been together all day and can identify three of four points each.
Spieth was incredibly strong from the end to the green and is a good example.
In the course of his round, the guinea pig was cast off as he dropped an important pot to decide the fourth match with four points for both of them after he and Thomas had left two holes with two points.
His Put, who chose the match on the 15th floor for her, solved a similar step that concludes that the American team is not yet out of the game.
“I really need to clean myself up and take care of my own game,” said Spieth.
That's all the players still have.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood as the only player in the last two days have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas and, of course, wrote the story of Ryder Cup.
Europe's unique, but sympathic duo is at four of four points and can do nothing wrong.
“Molywood” was not the only couple who had not killed a bogey on Saturday, but they had also avoided on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons, and the last nine Sundays on Friday mornings.
This series and the apparent energy between them and the amount of energy released suggests that they are the players that will be hit on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players who will win a possible European victory at the sunset of the sun over Le Golf National.
By default, both at the same time in different spaces.
However, it would be too late to talk about European peace.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process with Sergio Garcia, the quarter of the morning that played with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes brought the Spaniards and the Swedes into a hill that they could not nearly overcome.
But on Sunday no one can help them from the mud.
The four and four couples are given the interaction between the couples, the advice they give or do not give, and the way and how a strategy can change rapidly, as fascinating as possible.
The Europeans have played better than the team so far and are clearly in charge on the last day. However, these four rounds have also shown that the US team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the United States, have suspected.
Europe goes on the last day of Ryder Cup with 10:6 in charge
Europe is next to the four and four parties from Saturday to the United States at 10:6 and goes with a solid premise in the last day of Ryder Cup.
The great playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two victories over the Tiger Woods fighting difficulties and was able to buy four points in Le Golf National.
The European Man, introduced by Thomas Björn, who wanted to recover the trophies lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated the four American Man against the wrongful Man in the morning and won the series with 3:1.
In the four parties, the US had more resistance and won two matches, but they could not stand back.
Jim Furyks Manship needed eight points in the 12th play on Sunday to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood won as the first European Newling four points in effect, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensitive week of Mollywood, won only as the second duo in the history of Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After killing Woods and Patrick Reed in the quarter, they were excellently harmonized and defeated the detached Woods and the American Newling Bryson Dechambeau with a more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who had fallen by two matches on Saturday, let his brilliant light shine on occasion, but now 19 of his 29 matches have been lost in four and four parties and seven in succession.
Justin Rose, who had retired during the four in the morning, returned and played the four parties as partners of Henrik Stenson. They won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world.
However, for Europe, this welcome winding day did not seem to have everything in view of Paris.
The three-time Major Winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the table for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They achieved a number of 2&1 victorys in the quarter over the Jon Ram and Ian Poulter playing for Spain and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the four parties after they lost the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, however, it was only twice that a team came back after it had moved into the single with a delay of four points. As a title holder, however, Furyk's manship had a difference to keep the trophies.
After only two days in second place, it does not appear as if they could start an attack on Sunday.
North Korea suffers from untrustworthy depletion
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday before the United Nations that continued sanctions would have destroyed its mystery against the United States and would not have imposed its nuclear weapons on the country under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World Organisation that North Korea has taken "good will" measures last year." For example, it has stopped nuclear and rocket tests to build the nuclear field and undertakes not to mix nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will not be cut off at first."
While Ri relied on North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a “phasing” approach to the denuclearization, in North Korea for successful steps, it would have repeatedly appeared that his statement would have meant otherwise if it did not deny a unilateral denuclearization of the past, as Pjungjang had done in the past.
Ri refers to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an emigrating US president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore. In this, Kim had promised to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea is headed for an official end of the Korean war from 1950 to 1953, while the United States has said that Pjungjang had to give up his nuclear weapons first.
In addition, Washington's claims were rejected after the closing of the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States is on "first nuclearization" and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its objective by force, and are even opposed to the "declaration of the war", said Ri.
“The assumption that sanctions can be imposed on us in the neck is a hieroglyphistication of people who know nothing about us.
The problem is, however, that the continued sanctions deepen our mystery."
Ri was not on plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. state-of-the-art summit had highlighted at the beginning of the week with the United Nations.
Instead, at three meetings between Kim and the South Korean Head of State Moon Jae-in over the past five months, the Minister added: "If South Korea were to replace the other party in the question of denuclearization, it would not have been possible to do so in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula."
However, the tone of Ris Rede differed enormously from his speech in the last year when he said it was impossible for the UN General Assembly to target North Korea rockets on the U.S. country after "the bad president" Trump Kim referred to as "raketenmann" on a suicide mission.
This year, however, the storm that had threatened North Korea in the last year with the “complete destruction” was overrun by Kim at the United Nations with praise for his courage in view of the steps of disarmament. However, he said that there was still much work to be done and that the sanctions would remain in force until the nuclearization of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trup said that he had no time frame for it: "If it lasts two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must pay for the steps taken.
US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo, however, said on Thursday to the UN Security Council: "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must be continued energetically in any case until we have achieved the full, final and verified denuclearization."
Since 2006, the Security Council has strengthened sanctions against North Korea in order to financialize Pjungjang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo met Ri at the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pjungang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea this year three times, but his last trip was not successful.
In July he said at the opening of Pjungjang that progress had been made to be made only to be accused of North Korea hours later, he had made “passive demands”.
North Korea agreed to build this month at a meeting with Moon, a rocket base and an atomic complex when the United States adopted “compliant measures”.
He said Kim had told him that the “agreed measures” sought were security guarantees that had been provided by Trump in Singapore, as well as steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students get more sleep in this year's elementary school. This is a measure against the widespread macho culture to stay awake with coffee and learn all night.
One scientist has found that students at the world's leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to paying attention.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is according to the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to call the course into life after he had given a speech on the effects of sleep deprivation on the students.
“At the end a girl came to me and asked: ‘Why do I know about it first, in my last year?’
According to her words, no one had ever told you how important sleep is. That surprised me," he said against The Telegraph.
The course this year first explained to the students how the foundations of good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance and also improve the general wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the Managing Director of the University's Health Services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after she had determined that students were under severe stress during the week.
The one-time course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, the students see the picture of a room in a living room and click on coffee ets, dishes, training shoes and books. They receive information on the effect of caffeine and light as well as the effects of sleep defects on the sport performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleepiness can increase the risk of heart problems, strokes and cancer.
Next, they will be arranged to think about their daily routine through a map of the university's field with interactive symbols.
“We know that the students’ behaviour will not be changed immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this – exactly how you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health," added Professor Czeisler.
The emphasis on spreading a “study to shoot” was still on, he said and added that modern technologies and the constantly growing pressure on the students made the lack of sleep a growing problem.
In order to ensure a good sleep, he said that all students should be “heavy weapons” against stress, creation and anxiety. Furthermore, a weight loss was avoided as sleep takes the brain into the hungry mode, so that they are always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, was half Professor Czeisler to design the course. In his first year in Harvard, he completed a course.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and invited him to attend a long university course.
He hopes that the next step will require all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before they take their studies at the competitive university.
After Professor Czeisler's recommendation, the students should take a week to sleep and watch and be aware of the harmful effects of the "Blue Light" that arise from electronic screens and LED lightings and can bring the zircadian rhythm out of the tag. This leads to problems when you shut down.
Livingston v. Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor based on Gerrards Player
The Rangers lost another outdoor game when the encounter of Dolly Menga for Steven Gerrards meant a 0:1 drawback at Livingstone.
The Ibrox-Mansion wanted to sell its first appearance from the 4-1-triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holts team added the first second download in 18 games as manager, so that his men left eight points behind the long-run hearts in the Ladbroke Premiership.
Many met seven minutes before the middle of the day, and the inspirational weapons of Rangers seemed to have no chance to compare.
While the rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third place and is only behind Hibernian.
The rangers also had to be treated after the linear correction of Calum Spence because of a head wound by an object that appeared to have been removed from the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the men, the Ayr survived and reached the half-final of the Peace Cup.
On the other hand, there were the same eleven Livington players who took their hearts off in the last week, and had to be excited about how his well-trained man kept his opponent on step and trip under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the ball owner, but Livingston achieved more when they had the ball.
In just two minutes, they were supposed to reach a tower when Mengas first awarded Scott Pittman to Allan McGregors Tower. However, the middle-field player missed his chance and shot him.
Then a long break from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his reverse partner Alan Lithgow was only able to pass on the rear floor.
The rangers took control, but their game proved more promising than it was in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was apparently the view that after a quarter-hour meeting between him and Steven Lawless, he would have received a penalty, but the complainant Steven Thomson did not allow the Colombian complaint to be applied.
The rangers reached only two torso in the first half, but the former Ibrox Torhut Liam Kelly had few difficulties with Lassana Coulibalys headball and a famous shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingstones met in the 34th minute probably did not discuss the game, it is not to lie that they had earned him alone for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers could not walk around a long shot ball with one of Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who held the peace and sought Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerrard dealt half-time and drowned Coulibaly against Ryan Kent. The change showed almost immediate effect when the pilot Morelos took his position, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to bring the guests to play exactly the game that lies with them, where Lithgow and Halkett received a long ball after the other.
Holt's men could have built their leadership in the last phase, but McGregor stood up and stopped Jacobs before Lithgov took a headball out of the corner.
Glenn Middleton, the Ranger-Exchanger, also called for a penalty trial after a joint with Jacobs, but Thomson saw again.
Almanach: The Founder of the Creature
And now a page from our Sunday Morning German: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that eventually led to the device known as the generator.
In addition, since being the standard element of science, the gay figures have become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado with the apparently unusual Cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is this in all the world?"
Rogers: “It’s a resistor that is used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
If you set these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans, “I’m really hearing a knife!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, the discovery that bears his name continues to exist.
New cancers can help the immune system to “see” developed cells
A new cancer can help the immune system to “see” and destroy the desired cells.
The vaccine helps the immune system to identify desired cells during treatment.
A patient's immune cells that are changed in the laboratory are removed by the method.
These cells can “see” a number of types of cancers together and are then re-injected.
A test substance shows promising results in patients with different cancer types.
The eyestock cancer of a woman who was treated with the vaccine that causes the immune system to identify desired cells has been missing for more than 18 months.
In the method, a patient's immune cells are removed, which are changed in the laboratory so that they can “see” the many types of cancers together with HER2. The cells are then re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results are to conclude that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "increases the growth of various types of cancers", including breast, eggstock, lung and darm cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method, which is taken in patients with immunosuppression and which is accompanied by the use of cancer cells, has helped in the treatment of leukemia.

It wasn't good.
Kanye West was released at Saturday Night Live in the studio after he had awarded US-wide president Donald Trump and said he wanted to join the presidential candidate for 2020.
Following his third title of the evening, Ghost Town, singing and wearing a make-America Great Again hat, he continued with a skirmish song against the Democrats and repeatedly stressed his support for Trump.
“I will be asked so often by white, ‘How can you like Trump? He is racist.’
So if I were to worry about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began sending a case with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood Star made himself funny about Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate's Justice Committee to the charges of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the registration of West Schimpftride was not sent, it was uploaded by Commissioner Chris Rock into social media.
It is not clear whether Rock wanted to make himself funny with the publication about the West.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had difficulties behind the stage because of his head covering.
“They drove me behind the stage.
They said, "Don't go out with the head."
They've kicked me out!
And then they say, I was in a weakened area," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
He said, “Do you want to see the missed area?” He said, “Take my Supermancape, because it means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want it to happen with the world?
Try it with love."
Its comments were released at least two times from the public, and SNL-activators were deeply affected, reported variation. One person said in the magazine: "It was fatal in the studio."
West was later committed as replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, Rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West interviewed many with a talk entitled “I Love it”, in which he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA. She tweeted: “To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you, DASS YOU DICH OF THE MASS ENGINE STELLET HAST.”
However, the talk show moderator Karen Hunter tweeted, the West was just himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
"But I would like to thank someone who, according to my opinion, makes himself a harmful ideology for my community and does not reward himself (to buy his music or his dress or his 'art').
He's free.
The same applies to us," she added.
Before sending the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and now “The being formally known as Kanye West” (The officially known as Kanye West beings).
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dog took the name Snoop Lion, and of course the prince changed his name in a symbol and then in "The Artist Formerly Know As Prince".

"Game of Thrones"-Star Kit Harington Touches Toxic Humanity
Kit Harington is known for his role as the sword of violent Jon Snow in HBOs by violence, a medieval fantasy series “Game of Thrones”.
The 31-year-old actor, however, attacked the stereotype of the machohelden. He said that such roles on the screen would have been the result that boys often had to be strong enough to be respected.
In conversation with "The Sunday Times Culture", Harington said that he believed that something was going on, and asked how to solve the problem of toxic humanity in #MeToo-time.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, who was also involved in “Game of Thrones”, also married 31, said that the solution to the problem was “very important”.
"I personally find the issue very important at the moment what is wrong with humanity," he said.
"What have we grown men added to the problem we have now observed?"
Harington believes that television is responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to very masculinity.
He continued: “What has been born, and what has been learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that boys feel that this particular side of a man needs to be wrapped up?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time: How do we change this?
For there is clearly something going down on the ship in the young men."
In addition, he said in the interview that after the end of the series in the next summer he would not participate in Prequels or Sequels of “Game of Thrones”.
From November Harington is seen in a new flag of Sam Shepards “True West”, the story of a film producer and his brother, a rapper.
The actor recently admitted that for him the best of “Game of Thrones” was that he had known his wife Rose.
“I have known my wife in this assignment, so I have thus received my future family and life from now on,” he said.
Rose Leslie played in the great fantasy series Ygritte, the favorite of Harington's character Jon Snow.
In June 2018, the two married Leslies family members in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Only about 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In contrast to the past, the transfer took place in the vast majority of the new cases through sexual trafficking.
To date, HIV spread in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected in this way with HIV has almost been reduced to zero, Chinese health officials attended a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, by comparison, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China.
HIV transmission through sex is a serious problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT-Community members should be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually married women.
Many of the transmissions of disease are due to insufficient protection in the area of sexual trafficking in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised, inter alia, general access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that employees have been able to ensure the data of the GOP senators, criticises “hazardous lies” and “problem theories”
Maxine Waters, members of the U.S. House of Representatives, argued on Saturday charges, a member of her staff published the personal information from three Republican US senators on the Wikipedia pages of the members.
Democrats from Los Angeles believe that the allegations of "extremely justified" experts and websites would spread.
“ Lies, lies and even more absurd lies”, said Water in a statement on Twitter.
The information published should include the private addresses and telephone numbers of the US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was presented online on Thursday. During the hearing of a Senate Committee against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, charges of sexual harassment were published by an unknown person in the government district.
The publication took place after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the contributions has been allocated to Waters’ Office and published information from a member of Waters’ staff, reported The Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Water.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were threatened by these false and false accusations – was not responsible for ensuring that this information was made.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters’ statement quickly solved criticism online, also by Ari Flescher, a former press speaker of the White House.
"This dementia is burning," Fleischer wrote.
“This may lead to the conclusion that she does not have the right temperature to be a member of the Congress.
Those who are accused of something they have not done must not be angry.
You mustn't be sad.
You must not question the complainant's motives.
You must be quiet and relaxed."
The reaction of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of criticism by critics, seemed to be like water’ reaction to the criticism of the Democrats, while the hearing was heated on Thursday.
Also, Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who went to the half-hours to wash water, expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing, if that's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the competent authorities and prosecution authorities of these allegations.
"We will ensure that the targets are filled," she continued, "and that they are taken to account for all their actions which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff."
Critics to “Johnny English – Man only lives three times” – weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
Meanwhile, it is a tradition to look for a new film in every British-coloured film for Brexit. It also seems to apply for this re-enactment of the action comedy parody franchise “Johnny English”, which started with “Johnny English – The Spion, which was released” in 2003 and was relived in 2011 with “Johnny English – now right now”.
Will an ironic self-sustainment on the subject, as we obviously know, be a new export chance for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glaucoma, crimsoning and incompetent Johnny English was extended to exchange for the second time. His name indicates more than anything else that it is a general comical creation for cinematologists in non-English space.
Of course, he is again the undercover mystery who is extremely cold and worldly, while he is actually contributing to the title music of “The hour of the winner” in London at the opening of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In addition, the figure was originally based on the Chaos, behind its back passengers and international secretaries, who played atkinson in the hidden Barclaycard television sets.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English came to a medieval resort and listened briefly to the rotor leaves on his helmet.
Atkinson's approach to physical comics is still going on, but the Humor seems rather weak and rare, especially since the "serious" series of films such as "007" and "mission Impossible" offer between the self-secured comedy elements.
Humor seems to be more directed to children than to adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy messages are not as simple and focused as Atkinson's stupid filmgags in the role of the leg.
The permanent current premium is now that Britain is in great danger.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super secret British spying network and filled the identity of all British agents in use, very much for the failure of the serviceable agent, a seemingly small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last strike for the Prime Minister, a broken and weighed figure that is already due to her political infamousity before the complete collapse: Emma Thompson is giving her best with this Quasi-Teresa-May character, but the script is not much here she can work with.
Your secret service advisor informs them that all active spyes have been removed and that is why they need to get someone out of the house.
This is also part of Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a post office, but there is informal teaching in the work as undercover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers a Spionage Academy that reminds of the School of Rock.
English will be brought back to a emergency conversation in Whitehall and re-enacted with his previously seriously tested Kampang Bough, which will be played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a U-boot commander, a nervous woman of the higher society in whose role Vicki Pepperdine has something to do with.
So Batman and Robin, who are always making a terrible mistake in your Majesty's secret service, are back in action. They meet Olga Kurylenkos beautiful Five Fatel Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously equipped with a charismatic tech billionaire, which was played by Jake Lacy. He claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain.
English and Bough begin their odyssee of the great time: As Keller dressed they hold a famous French restaurant in Brand, they care for Chaos as they swim on the board of Voltas luxury, and English releases pure anarchy when he tries to build trust with a virtual reality headset with the inside of Voltas House.
In this last sequence, however, all registers are taken, but they are both sympathetic and funny, the subject is already dealt out in the children's television.
Very moderate substance.
As with other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself, "Can the British film bunker Rowan Atkinson not have a role to play that will really justify his talent?"
Labor aims to work on a plan that the British work four days a week, but should be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbys Labor Party is going to consider a radical plan that foresees the British working four days a week, but will be paid for five days.
The Party wishes to report that business leaders continue to give employees the savings achieved by the KI revolution (artificial intelligence).
The staff would have had a three-day week, but they would still get the same pay.
It follows that the idea of the Party's economic agenda and its plans to move the balance in the country for the benefit of the workers.
The conversion to a four-day week was facilitated by the Trade Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the advantages of the changing economy.
A high source from the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “A directive is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"A change will not occur at night, but a work week of four days is an attempt to restore the economic balance of workers and the overall industrial policy strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first party to promote such an idea. The Green Party has already promised the introduction of a 4-day week campaign during the general election campaign 2017.
However, the approach is not currently endorsed by the Labour Party at all.
A speaker of the Labour Party said: "At a 4-day week it is not a party policy and it will not be taken into account by the party."
Schatten Chancellor John McDonnell concreteized his presentation of a socialist revolution in the economy last week at the Labour Conference.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of “anonymous directors” and “profitmakers” in public supply companies.
The plans of the Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water supply companies may not retain their entire share, as a labor government could take over due to the possible lack of “reductions” behaviour.
He also confirmed the relevant plans to employ employees in the management of companies and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of private company equity to employees who make annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy appear in the news magazine "60 minutes" if the FBI's investigation could change their opinion in the Kavanaugh case
The FBI's investigation of the claims against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has finalised its appointment to the Supreme Court of Justice for at least one week and raises the question whether the results of the Republican senators may affect the results of the authorities in order to obtain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the 60-minute Correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring some days to change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I have been informed in the negotiations that I have spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I then called him, said this statement, and asked if he had done it.
He was determined, determined, and unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be mixed in stone.
"My opinion is what Brett Kavanaugh is about, and it had to place a bomb," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what’s happening, but I know the following: Bret has strongly argued this,” Graham added, adding: “I don’t know what’s going on, but I know what’s going on.”
"And everyone they called couldn't confirm it."
It's 36 years now.
And I can't make any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and was helped to reduce poverty within this festival?
On this Saturday, in New York, the Global Citizen Festival is taking place to fight every year with a impressive line of stars and an impressive mission – poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will visit the Global Citizen Festival, which takes place this year for 7 times, not only to experience the events of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to strengthen awareness of the actual goal of the event: the fight against extreme poverty until the year 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. Within this project, an international interest group is trying to fight poverty by encouraging more and more people to participate actively in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), a number of tasks must be completed. These include voluntary work, communication with a leading politician worldwide (by e-mail or telephone) or similar measures to increase awareness of the goal of combating poverty.
How successful is the project when you think that Global Citizens are still 12 years old to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of setting up a cool free concert, a meaningful opportunity to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of clictivism – if you think it is to change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citics reported that the project has been able to record more than 19 million actions from its supporters since 2011.
These actions should have contributed to attracting policymakers around the world, reporting commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group received 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or received by fundraising.
According to the group's estimates, the secured funds have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are the project The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementers who have committed themselves to supporting children in their optimal development and who have promised to help Rwanda with $35 million to combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make social injustice of subsidizing into a footnote in history,” the messenger of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also shared that after more than 5,000 actions, with which the United Kingdom was asked to improve the food situation of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the project The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide food interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely the question of why Global Citizens can fight extreme poverty,
They replied: “It will be a long and intense road with heights and depth.
But like the great civil rights and anti-parity movements before us, we will succeed as we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monée are among the artists who take part in this year's event in New York. They are also Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
The United States could use the sea for blocking Russian energy exports – Ministry of the Interior
According to Washington Examine, Washington can return to the sea when necessary so that the markets, including the Middle East, from Russia, are not reached, was shared by US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke.
Zink claimed that the use of Russia in Syria is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets. Russia is currently active at the invitation of the legal government in these areas.
"I think that the real reason for the use of Russia in the Middle East is the negotiation of new energy markets, just like in Eastern Europe," he said.
And according to the staff, there are means and means to do this.
"The United States, together with the sea, can ensure that the Seas remain open and, if necessary, block them in order to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was among the participants in the event of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group, which is understood to be "the voice of the power user" in the United States.
He drew a comparison between Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran and established that they are practically identical.
"The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia," he said, while referring to Russia as "One Trick Pony" with a fossil-dependent economy.
The declarations were made when the government was under durump to expand the export of liquid land gas to Europe and replace Russia with a more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" Pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump Berlin, became the "Gegenen" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2-Pipeline is worth 11 billion US dollars, which will double the existing Pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters to deal with an exclusive economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the massive resistance of Washington to the project is to be put back on economic grounds and is an example of unwarranted competition.
"I think we are all thinking that energy should not be used as a means to exercise pressure and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The US has received wind from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federal Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to withdraw from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem when a third country joins in our energy supply," said BDI Dieter's board after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants a presidential candidate 2020 "examine exactly," says the Senator for Massachusetts
The senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "check exactly" a presidential candidate after the inter-election.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, it confirmed that it is worth considering a candidate.
According to The Hill, Warren said it would be for women at the time to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, and that includes women at the peak.
After 6 November, Warren proposed a presidential candidacy "to check it out".
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump had fallen into the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about Donald Trump dealing with our democracy," she said.
Warren did not take a sheet in front of his mouth when he was critical of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that before the vote, an FBI investigation was required.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of the Warren Elections do not believe that they should apply for 2020.
According to the survey of Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of the potential voters in Massachusetts indicated that the senator should not apply.
32% of the voters supported such a candidate.
The survey showed more support for a candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick; with 38 per cent of potential candidates, and 48 per cent of those against.
The other names of prominent Democrats, which are concerned with a possible candidate for 2020, are former vice president Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, he said he would decide officially until January.
Sarah Palin is on the Donald Trump-Ralley for post-traumatic stress disorder, leading under the track Palin
Track Palin, 26, was a long year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence at the Montagabend.
"What my son is doing is what he does when he comes back, that he can feel all the other families that are suffering from the effects of PTBS and some of the wounds that our soldiers return with," she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his arrest as “Elefant in space” and said about her son and other war veterans that she changed her mind to return later that they would come back and ask if there was such respect before what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military had given the country.
On Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence to a woman, so Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the police department of Vasilla.
18 Federal and D.C. support legal aid for the new asylum policy
18 Federal States and the District of Colombia support a legal aid to the new US policy, to avoid victims of gang activities or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 Federal States and the District filed a court hearing on Friday in Washington to support an asylum tenderer who is involved in politics, reported NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace vs. session complaint submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy was not known.
She said that her partner "and her violent son" had abused them, but US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The statesmen who support Grace named El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the United States, as nations that have had serious problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy launched a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeal decision that allowed illegal immigrants to flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In a statement on Friday, Karl Racine, the General Bundesan of the District of Colombia, stated that the new policy “has been ignored by state, federal and international legislation for decades”.
"The Federal Law provides that all asylum applications are assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application and that the court is in breach of this principle," was stated in the court ruling.
The prosecutors further argued in the statement that the policy that immigrants refuse to have access to the country had an adverse impact on the economy in the United States, since immigrants could be more active than entrepreneurs and could provide the necessary labour forces.
In June, the General Federal Attorney Jeff Sessions announced that immigration judges who fled from domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs would no longer provide asylum.
"Asyl is available to all who leave their home country because they are persecuted or because of fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political belief," said sessions in his announcement of politics on 11 June.
It was never the plan to solve all the problems of asylum, even all the most serious problems people have to face every day of the world.
Suspected rescue tests in Palu, since the number of victims in the race doubled over time
For the survivors, the situation has become increasingly worse.
“It’s all very exciting,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, and eases her little fiebing son into a rescue center in the ruined city of Palu.
“Every minute a new hospital car comes with deaths.
The clean drinking water is almost."
The inhabitants returned to their ruined houses to collect their riches and goods, and to raise all that they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of the hospitals who were damaged by the earthquake with the strength of 7.5 were completely overloaded.
Some of the victims, including two Hari Haris, who were involved in the rape and a broken victim, remained outside Palu's military hospital, where patients in the outside world were treated for their persistent follow-up.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the heavy earth shook the hotel room in the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"All went too fast.
I think I was trapped under the fallen walls," he told the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding time.
“I heard the cry of my wife, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope they're in a safe place."
US messengers complain of the Tyrians with "propagandism"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper had triggered a four-page display in an American daily newspaper, where the opposite benefits of trade between the United States and China were announced, the US messenger in China accused Beijing of using American press for propaganda purposes.
The United States Donald Trump spent the last Wednesday on the paid membership of China Daily in the My Book, the most sold magazine in Iowa, after he accused China of joining the United States Congress elections on 6 November, a complaint against China.
Trump's allegations that Beijing has tried to intervene in the US elections correspond to the message of US officials to Reuters; a new phase of a scaling campaign, released from Washington to print in China.
While it is common for foreign governments to activate advertising to promote the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently being developed in an emergency trade war, with duties on imports for both countries.
The Chinese compensation charges at the beginning of the war should be met by exporters in countries such as Iowa, who supported the Republican party from Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, US messenger in China and former governor of Iowa, who exported large quantities of agricultural products to China, reported that Beijing had damaged workers, owners of agricultural companies and companies.
China, such a town in a position in Des Moines Register of Sunday, now doubles these Tyranes by launching propaganda in its own free press in the United States.
“With the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government calls for the tradition of the free expression of opinion and the independent press, by turning the country’s advertising into the Des Moines Register,” Brandstad wrote.
“In contrast, you will find here in Beijing only in a limited number of votes against and do not find any real reflection of the different opinions that China may have about the disturbing economic development of China, given the fact that the media are firmly in the hands of the Communist Party of China.”
He added that one of China’s most famous newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article. However, he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republican voters announced the election with the Debakal about Kavanaugh, warning observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in view of more accusations of sexual violence, observers have warned of a response during the pre-existing exchange options that might arise, especially by women.
The vote in this connection was extremely slow, and most Republicans have already indicated that they will continue with a vote.
“These things can’t be reversed,” said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last minute preview (R-Arisona) is sufficient for an FBI investigation to deal with the angry voters.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday, they don’t forget it tomorrow and not even in November”, said Karine Jean-Pierre, the first consultant and national speaker for the progressive group MoveOn, so the daily newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called on the Senate 'November is coming', when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to stick to Kavanaugh's nomination and despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, told Mic.
Democratic interest and motivation were an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, a non-participated political observer of the news site.
"People say it's already high, that's true.
But it could be higher, especially for voters in the pre-elections and younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who, although they don't like the presidents, often don't choose."
Even before the public statement of Ford, in which their allegations of sexual assault against the candidates of the Supreme Court were detailed, observers indicated that a counter-reaction could be the result if the Republicans submitted the confirmation.
"This situation is a terrible contrast to the GOP," said Mr. Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, saying NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote of the panel, the final vote or the review of Kavanaughs; it is also about the way the Republicans have done it and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, Director at Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats, the press channel.
The Americans, however, seem to be alone who should believe because of the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly larger share being placed on the latter side.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of the respondents were convinced definitively or possibly by Ford’s statement, while 35% claimed that they gave Kavanaugh’s faith definitively or probably.
38 % further indicated that they were of the opinion that Kavanaugh had probably or definitely lied in his statement, while 30% of the same was said about Ford.
Following the pressure of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford and at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford made an excellent statement last week before the Senate's Justice Committee that she was attacked at the age of 17 by the drunk Kavanaugh.
Ramirez claimed that the candidate for the Supreme Court had excommunicated her genitals when she was on a party during her study in Yale in the 1980s.
The Founder of the World Wide Web plans the launch of a new Internet to counter Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the discoverer of the World Wide Web, is currently making a start in the market with the aim of establishing a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology-elevating, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee made it best that the intention behind the intrusion be the "World Heritage".
"We must be active now," he said on the issue of startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app introduces the technology of Solid so that users can create their own personal online data memory or a POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library and other tools for the private and business area.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all content in a browser and at the same time available.
The special feature of the personal online data store is that the user can decide only who can access the data.
The company refers to this concept as personal strengthening and development of data.
According to CEO of the company John Bruce, the idea behind the intrusion that the company uses resources, processes and related capabilities to make solid available to all.
The company currently belongs to Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been set up to work on this project, as well as a community of voluntary programmers.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers can create their own decentralised apps worldwide with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee explained that he and his team will not exchange with Facebook and Google if a comprehensive change is to be made, where their entire business models will be fully redesigned over the night.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In an input to media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee provided for a redesign of the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past months Berners-Lee has been actively involved in the debate on network neutrality.
Even with the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely confident of what this new era of the web requires," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, holder of the Victorian Cross in World War I, was honored
The only spiritual leader of the Church of England, who was appointed as a fighter with the Victorian cross during World War I, was respected 100 years later in his hometown.
Colonel and priest Bernard Vann won the award because of his use in the attack on Bellenglish and Lehacourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a shield shield and never learned that he had won the highest British military rank.
His two grandsons buried a monument on Sunday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the singles, Michael Vann, felt that this act was full of symbolism, since the memory stone was completed almost 100 years after the Herodentat, for which his father was honored.
According to The London newspaper, Colonel Vann led his batallon over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918; through dense nebula and under heavy pressure from field cannons and machine guns.
Later he moved forward to the fire line and led the line with the "greatest stopper" before he launched a field fight in the alley and turned three of the military units off.
Colonel Vann was shot by a German shield guard on October 4, 1918; something more than a month before the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the deeds of his grandfather were something he could never be judged, and at the same time something that would become a nuisance.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid a crown under the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann pointed out that he felt very ashamed to be able to participate in the parade and added that the attractiveness of a real hero would be particularly visible through the support of many people.
MMA fans have been awake all night to see Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you've been awake all night to see a exciting Bellator 206, and then you can't see the main event.
The account of San Jose included 13 battles, including 6 on the main map, and was spent alive all night in the United Kingdom on channel 5.
About 6 hours later, just as Gheard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the visitors in the United Kingdom were not as bad as suddenly to see Peppa Pig.
Some remain unaffected after they have stayed awake until early in the morning to see the fight especially.
A fan described on Twitter the change to the trick film figure as a kind of bad screen.
"On the basis of a regime by the Government, these content will be replaced as not youth-free, so that it would have to be changed to a child-send at 6 o'clock," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President in the area of marketing and communication with Bellator when he was asked about the transfer.
"Peppa, the Sweain, exactly."
The company's board at Bellator, Scott Cooker, announced that the company will be working on the launch plan to take into account visitors from the United Kingdom in the future.
"I think the problem could have been solved by the game of repetition," he said.
“But it is 6 a.m. on a Sunday with visitors in the United Kingdom, and we will not solve the event until Sunday, our time, Monday.
But we'll stay in there.
There was quite a lot of communication in the exchange, and it went very well together, and it wasn't always all net.
We have tried to solve the problem and have concluded that it is a technical disturbance.
What wasn't the case was a problem with the government.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce the whole of 5 instead of 6 battles, as usual. And we've tried to offer the fans the best possible experiences.
The whole situation is quite sad."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels about sexuality
Tom Daley, who has participated in various Olympic games as a water streamer, says that he has grown up with the feeling to be subject to everyone because of his sexuality. But this feeling had motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old thought that he had only realized at the continuing school that he was different than others.
In the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne said he spoke about school rights to encourage others.
He also meant that since he became a father, the victories of the Olympic Games are no longer so important to him.
The real moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, is suffering from illness for a few months.
In his first letter to Laverne, he said that he considered himself to be inferior in comparison with others, since the love of boys and girls was completely unacceptable.
He said: “To this day it is the feeling of subordination and of being different from the others, the reason for my power and strength and finally for my success.”
He wanted to prove that he was a very special person to impress no one when his sexual orientation was known.
The two-fold bronze medal winner in the Olympic Games is a prominent LGBT activist today and used his experience at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to promote the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he was referring to this subject because he was happy that he could live without restrictions and without discrimination and that he wanted to encourage others.
The three-time world teacher loved the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The discovery of being in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
The 20-year-old Oscar winner married Daley last year, but he told him that the age difference had never been a topic.
He believes that if you had to spend so much as a child and young people – he participated in the Olympics for the first time 14 times and his father died three years later on cancer, it is difficult to find someone at the same age with similar experiences.
Since June, the couple has had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley believes that his overall view has changed since.
In the last year, he had done everything about gold medals.
But for him there is now more important than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main winner.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of Hirntumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept the imminent death, and one of the last things he asked about was the tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be with him in the first place.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there anymore," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only then I finally realized that he was not invisible," he continued.
The following year Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympic Games.
"I just knew that it was always my dream to get baptized in Olympic games before the domestic audience – that was the war," he said.
His first choice – Proud of Heather Small – was also influenced by his first choice. He heard the song in front of the Olympic Games and was still looking after Günsea.

Mickelson, who is not currently in shape, sits at Ryder Cup on Saturday at the replacement bank
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday at his 47. Ryder Cup game, but he has to work very hard to keep it from becoming a debacle.
Mickelson, who played the event 12 times, was sent by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday to the replacement bank.
Instead of being in the middle of the event, the five Majors spent their day in order to fire others and work at his game, in the hope of overcoming the problems that weigh him down.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the direct golfer and therefore no ideal crew for the fine Le Golf National golf course, where missing balls are regularly punished.
And if the place itself would not be discouraged enough, Mickelson will meet the perfect British Open Champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood, Newling at these tournaments, in the ninth game on Sunday, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, with four points of retreat at the 12 individual games, have a hot start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely decisive.
Furyk probably went out to Mikkelson and couldn't add much to it either.
"He was perfectly aware of his role today in the clarinet, gave me a cup on my back and put his arm around me and thought he was ready for tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has quite much confidence in himself.
He is one of the world's famous personalities and has done so much for these teams in the past week too.
I didn't think he was in two games.
I had more idea, but that's how it's run now and that's what we've been waiting for.
He wants to be like everyone else."
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldos record for most of the Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup race, which would never match the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson can record 18 wins, had to hide 20 downloads and reached seven semi-times, although Furyk announced that his presence had already reached the team alone.
“He is funny and sarcastic, original and does a few jokes, and he is a great man who is popular with the whole team,” he explained.
“I think the younger players were glad to get to know him a little closer this week. It was fun to see them.
He's a really interesting person who gives many impulses."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that it can be through with the premise soon
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great premise leading to the last single games in Ryder Cup can quickly become an unacceptable situation.
The Dane debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team set up by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point lead against the Americans, but only a little over the target came and led with the smallest possible lead and gained a victory from 1411⁄2–131/2.
"The thought remains that we had a great spring in Valderrama, we had a great spring in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we had won, but it was only a small one," Björn said (on the photo) after he had seen the winner 5-3 of the 2018 class both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all team members that it's not over.
Tomorrow's the right time.
Put yourself in the witness and do the right thing.
The whole is over when the points are on the display table.
We have a goal, we want to win these trophies, and right there is our focus.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are fully aware of what is happening to us on the other side: the best players in the world."
Curious about the performance that his players had completed on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never forget it.
Tomorrow's gonna be another caliber.
Tomorrow's the singles are in the background, and that's a completely different thing.
It's great to work with a partner when things go well, but if you're alone out there, then you're tested to the limit of your abilities as a golfer.
You have to make this clear to the players: the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he must also get the best out of himself."
In contrast to Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will be careful that his players are better off than in the team, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of the great rounds on the last tournament day. He stood in Brooklyn on the winning side before he stood on the side of the losers after Europe’s “Wows of Medinah”.
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question like Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to take off the fast start you have seen in Brooklyn and in Medinah.
When the moment points to a direction, it puts the medium games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send our boys out the way we feel, you know we're trying to cook tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of overcoming opposition, he had to play in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the upper half of the range list.
"I have decided for the boys in this series because I think it's all covered," said Bjorn about his choice for the individual encounters.
Germany's new warship is delayed again
The latest fleets of the German Navy should have been used in 2014 to replace warships from the time of the Cold War. However, they will be delivered by local media because of miscellaneous systems and fast growing costs only next year.
The introduction of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leading ship of the new "Baden-Württemberg" class, was now transferred to the first half of 2019.
The ship should have been in service already in 2014, but the ambitious project was subject to disturbing problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, already ordered by the sea in 2007, are to replace the old frigates of the Bremen-Class.
They should include an efficient cannon, a number of air-conditioning rockets and seaplane bodies, as well as cutting technologies such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic plexion.
Another important feature is longer waiting periods. It should be possible that the latest Fridays do not have to return to their homes for up to two years.
However, the continued delays can lead to the fact that the highly modern warships that Germany is supposed to represent as a seminar are already renewed at the time of its entry into force, such as The Time.
The F125 Fregate, followed by the accident, was thrown into the castles last year when the German Navy officially refused to take off the ship and returned it to the Werft Bloom & Voss in Hamburg.
That was the first time that the sea returned a ship after its delivery to the ship.
It was little known about the reasons for the return, however, German media called a number of significant "software and hardware drivers", which had made the new ship useless in a fight situation.
Software problems are particularly difficult as ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are driven by a crew of only 120 matrozens, only about half as many as on the older frigates of the Bremen-Class.
It was also known that the ship is too heavy to lead to performance inputs and prevented the sea from carrying out future upgrade measures.
The 7000 tons heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" was apparently twice as difficult as ships with a similar class used by Germany in the second world war.
In addition to the missing hardware, the costs of the entire project, including the training costs of employment, have also been a problem.
The costs are likely to rise to an airborne 3,1 billion euros, compared to the originally planned €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest Fridays are particularly important in view of the latest warnings that the summit will collapse in Germany.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartel, a German Federal Wehrber, confirmed that the sea “exists the useful ships”.
Bartels said that the problem became bigger with time, since old ships were taken away from service, but no replacement ships had been provided.
He argued that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken from the sea.
National Trust Breaks the Secret Life of the Fleeder Mouse
In an presence in the Scottish Highlands, new research works are being carried out to show how Fledermusee uses the landscape in the search for food.
It is hoped that the results will allow further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to guide future natural protection activities.
The study carried out by researchers at National Trust for Scotland will be conducted in the Inverwe Garden in West Ross, as well as in the Braunen Langohr and WaterFlight Museums.
Special recording devices shall be set at key positions on the ground to record the activities of the flag mouse during the entire season.
employees of the NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile tests with portable detectors.
In a noise analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequency of the Flydermaus call is determined and identified what species do.
Next, a map and a report of the living room will be drawn up to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at rural level.
Rob Dewar, natural protection consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will be shown which areas of life for the flag mouse are the most important and how these are used by each species.
These data will help to determine the benefits of the measures to manage the living room, such as the creation of Wiesen, and to show how to obtain forest areas for river mice and other related species.
The fleet stocks in Scotland and the United Kingdom in the last century have been significant.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleep sites and leads to the loss of the living room.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as pilots and the chemical treatment of building materials or also attacks by house cassettes.
Flyermuses aren't really blind.
However, their ears are more useful because of their nightly hunting habits than their eyes when it comes to catching bees.
They use an excavated echo to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historical buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland, takes the theme of the Flanders Museum very seriously.
It has over 10 trained experts conducting regular investigations, inspection of sleeping sites and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even set up Scotland's first and only Fledermaus reserve in the Treve presence in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's 10 Fledermaus species.
Good Manager David Thompson explains that the existence of the ideal living room for her is the ideal one.
"Here in Thrive we have a great area for Fledermuse," he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old buildings and an excellent living room.
But there are many things we don't know about Fleder Mouse, so we're doing these and other good things that will help us learn more about what Fleder Mouse needs to feel better."
He stressed the importance of eliminating pre-servation work in the goods first because it was possible that the undesired destruction of a single nest site could kill up to 400 females and young animals and that the whole population could be wiped out in front of the place.
Fleedermuses are protected and it is illegal to kill them, kill them, or destroy their nests relatively.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish Beamtin of Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the people to help.
She explains: “We still have to learn a lot about river mice, and in many of our species, we don’t know how it is about their populations."
Ronaldo argues against rape, while his lawyers want to accuse the German magazine
Cristian Ronaldo referred to him as "Fake News" and said that people wanted to be "glorified" by using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the news magazine The mirror that published the charges.
The director of the National Team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was charged with the rape of an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he paid her next $375.000 to buy her back to the event, as was the mirror on Friday.
In an Instagram Live-Video of his 142 million followers, the 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports “Fake News” only hours after their release.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have reported today: Fake News", said the fifth winner of the Ballon d’Or in the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to be famous for my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," added the player laughingly.
Ronaldo's attorneys are prepared to accuse the mirror of the charges that they refer to as “unauthorized reporting of suspects in the field of privacy”.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player sought a set of damages for “moral damage in a height corresponding to the severity of the violation of law, which may represent one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.”
The event is to take place in 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they had met in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he reported that they had been raped by Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went to the knee after the alleged incident and said that he was “99% a good kernel”, which was due to the “one percent”.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but say it had been acceptable.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had taken photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later she joined an extrajudicial agreement, since she had “a long before compensation” and was careful to “publicly lower”.
The 34-year-old said that she was now trying to withdraw the agreement because she was still traumatized because of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident and changed this summer into a 100 million heavy deal to Italian rice Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would “suppose the loss of car manufacturer”
The United Kingdom would be “very careful” if after the Brexit it lost its status as a world-leading manufacturer of cars, as economic minister Greg Clark said.
He further said that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would slow down production in the work in Bernaston at Derby, the UK should leave the EU.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer pointed out that the impact of delays on the border could lead to the loss of jobs in a No-Deal Brexit.
The work in Burnaston, which was produced in Toyota's product line Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I am convinced that we will experience cuts in our work at an uncontrollable Brexit End of March," said Marvin Cooke, Toyotas Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also voiced concerns about a hard-out EU without agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says that it will close its mini-work in Oxford after the Brexit for a month.
The main concerns relate to the car manufacturers with risks within the delivery chain in a hard Brexit.
Toyotas production plant is operated on a "just-in-Time" basis, which means that parts of suppliers will be delivered from both the United Kingdom and the EU to complete the cars on order.
If the United Kingdom should leave the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could result in interruptions which could lead to delays and delays in the participation of the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to conduct a warehouse in Derbyshire, which lasted longer than a day, explained why the production had to be interrupted.
Clark explained that Theresa Mays Chequers Plan on the future relationship with the EU is "exceeding to avoid such border controls".
“We need a deal. We want the best deal that has enabled us, as I have already said, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to get this chance,” he explained in today’s BBC Radio 4.
"The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we must be able to continue very successful supply chains so far."
Toyota could not specify how long the production had to be interrupted, but warned long-term that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the work and lead to loss of employment.
Peter Tsovallaris, who has been employed in Burnaston for 24 years and who is the highest executive of the United Nations, explained that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience never returns these jobs once they are gone.
A government speaker said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trumps planned meetings with Rosenstein could be relocated according to the data of the White House
Donald Trumps' important meetings with the deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "extended for another week", while the dispute over candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued on Sunday, leaving the White House.
Rosstein has supervised the work of Special Mediar Robert Mueller, who examined the wave mix by Russia, links between Trump's consultants and Russia, and possible legal interference by the presidents.
The question whether Trump would fire the Minister of Justice and thereby endanger the independence of Muellers had been the subject of riots in Washington for a month.
At the beginning of the month, New York Times reported that Rosstein was responsible for the possibility of recording his secret talks with Trump and the President's delegation through the 25th Act.
Rosenstein deplored the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports about his possible return.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was then held at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced for the next Thursday,
Trup explained that he would not prefer to leave Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to prevent it from collating with the hearing before the U.S. Senate justice committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had been accused of sexual abuse.
On Friday, Trup arranged a weekly FBI investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press speaker Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
On a question about meeting Rosstein, she replied: “A date has not yet been established for this. It could be this week, but I can still imagine that it will be moved within a week, in view of all the things just going with the Supreme Court.
But I always like to keep the press on the run."
Some reporters would probably object to this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders stated that the low frequency of press conferences did not lie at a link to the TV reporter’s “effect-tachder” but said, “I would not, however, deny that they operate effectively.”
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would take place.
The President makes more questions and replies rounds than any President before him," she explained, without any clear evidence: "We have looked at these numbers."
Press conferences will still be given, as Sanders said, however, “if the press is able to ask the President of the United States directly, but much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this often and you've seen that we've done it often in the last few weeks. That'll take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions if he leaves the white house or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visitors.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is so when he drew up a series of reporters who were running out of the Ruder, and some strange performance.
Health Minister writes about Brexit concerns with EU employees of the Scottish NHS
The Minister of Health refers to persons from the EU-Austro, who are working in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS), to express the country's gratitude and to express their desire to remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already declared itself to bear the costs of applications for residence titles for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service of Scotland.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “During the summer the Eastern negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU were continued and decisions were expected to take place.
However, the British government has also strengthened the preparations for a possible No-Deal scenario.
I'm aware what exciting times this must have been for you all.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I contribute to any and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Fellows and colleagues from all over the EU and in addition bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is full and full of your home and we would be very happy if you stayed here."
Christion Abercrombie was subjected to a headache of notation
According to Mike Organ of Tennessee State, the Lenebacker of the Tennessee State of Tigers Christion Abercrombie was reported after a head injury, which he added on Saturday at the 31-27 landing on the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, chief coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the damage occurred shortly before the half-hour break.
"He came to the side line and just broke up there," Reed said.
Trainer and medical personnel provided Abercrombie on the side line with oxygen before being placed on a truck and transported for further tests.
A speaker from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie has left the OP in the medical center.
Harris added that “no details of the nature or extent of the damage” were known and Tennessee states are trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called Redshirt, plays in his first season at Tennessee State after he changed it from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded 5 tickets, thus increasing his total number in the season to 18 tickets.
Foreign investors must pay higher stamp taxes for real estate purchase in the United Kingdom
Investors from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax for the purchase of properties in the United Kingdom in the future.
This step is the success of Jeremy Corbys campaign for young voters
The increase in the voting fee will concern all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance is expected to spend up to 120 million dollars per year to help obstetricians.
Today, Theresa May will be announced that foreign investors have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy real estate in the United Kingdom, where multiple incomes are to be paid off.
This step is an attempt to achieve Jeremy Corbys success in young voters, who promises to provide more comfortable living space and to take top owners into the audience.
The increase in stamp taxes will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
In addition to the current tax on stamps and including the increase in double residences and leased housing, the increase could amount to up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance is calculated by the step with multiple incomes of up to 120 million pounds per year.
Estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by investors who are not in the United Kingdom. This makes the prices go high and it is difficult for first-time buyers to take on real estate.
Many well-being areas of the country, especially in the capital, have been “Geister cities” because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson spoke for a reduction in stamp taxes in order to allow more young people to own the first property.
He accused the construction companies of raising the real estate prices by buying land without using it, and forced Theresa May to impose quotas on affordable apartments in order to end the UK's "home damage".
Opposite Leader Corbyn announced a series of proposals for housing reforms, ranging from a rental price link to a ban on rooms without any legitimate reason.
He also wanted to build more powers in the construction of new apartments.
May explained: “Last year I said that I would like to spend my time as prime minister of the restoration of the British dream, according to which the life of generations to generation should be better.
And that's to repair our purchased housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it cannot be true that it is so easy for people who do not live in Britain, as well as for businesses living abroad, to buy real estate, such as for hard working British citizens.
The dream of ownership has become too much for many people and the inevitability of ignorance remains too great a problem."
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, the head of Sanderland, says that it is his ‘greatest’ goal to become the Scottish team's manager at some point.
The 42-year-old shot takes pleasure in the challenge of building a new life in the North East of England, which is just in the third place in the League One and missing three points.
He took this summer to the stadium of Light after he took St. Mirren back to the first Scottish league in the last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I created it on the bank and it was," said Ross of the BBC Scotland's Sendencing Sports Sound.
“But I have often seen playing with my father Scotland in Hampden as a child, and that is something that always draws me back.
However, this opportunity would only come if I were successful in joint management."
Ross in the role as manager of Sunderland includes Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former chief of Alloa Athletic told him to have no fear of entering such established names at such a club after he refused first offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured with me at the moment whether I can return the union to the Premier League.
In view of the structure and opportunities in this union, he is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he explained.
"It is not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably appreciate my time here only as a success if I bring the union back there."
Ross can present a three-year management career, after a phase as the deputy head of Dumbarton and a 15-month work as a trainer in hearts.
Then he helped Alloa to get from the relegation into the third League and withdrew St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation to win the mastership in the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever in his career at Clyde, Hartpool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It must have been a real tragedy," he recalls when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really believe that management was the right thing for me, more than games.
It sounds funny because I wasn't bad at all, I was able to live well and experienced some very pleasant colleges.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to do every week.
I still do this because of stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I've done it. I've never felt like I've ever felt in my skin in my whole life."

The perfect time for a glass beer is at 17:30 a.m., so a study
The winter change in summer has led to a rise in the revenue of British crisis pubs, while restaurants chained under greater pressure.
In July, public and private companies accounted for an increase of 2.7%. The revenues at the restaurants were low by 4.8 percent, however, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of CGA’s company council, which compiled the figures, explained: “Sunless and England longer than expected continuous participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June, in which the Pub’s sales increases of 2.8 percent were even more difficult.
The decline of 1.8 per cent, reported by the restaurant industry in June, continued in July.
Pubs and bars with emphasis on drinks gradually showed the best performance, with a flat-adjusted sales development that increased higher than they ate at the restaurants.
Pubs focus on food in the sun too, but not as dramatic as the restaurant operator.
It looks like the people wanted just a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, the drinking rates rise by 6.6 per cent per month, while the share of food returns by three per cent."
Paul Newman, one of the analysts for the leisure and host business RSM, explained: “These results continue the trend we have been able to observe since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sports events remain the biggest factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to struggle with problems, but sales prices of 4.8 per cent will be particularly painful compared with the previous year.
The long summer summer could not have come to a worse point for operators of companies with a focus on food and it remains to be expected that the relatively low temperatures in August will be delivered the urgently needed atemployment."
The total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including the openings, was 2.7% in July and reflected the return to the brand rollouts.
The industry-use monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds and is the recognised industry benchmark.
One of five children has secret accounts in social media that hide it from their parents
A study shows that every five children, sometimes only 11 years old, have secret accounts on social media that keep it secret before parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students in continuing schools has shown an increase in the so-called "Fake Insta" pages.
The message warns Christians that sexual content is placed at the same time
Twenty percent of the students offered to own a “main account” to show their parents
One of five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that can keep it secret before adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in continuing schools showed a rapid increase in so-called "Fake Insta" accounts, a loan to the photo sharing website Instagram.
The message warns the anxiety that sexual content is shared.
Twenty percent of the students offered to have a clean "main account" that they could show their parents, but also to have private accounts.
A mother, who stood on the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenager who was asked by others to “save me.”
The study conducted by Digital Awarenss UK and the Headmasters’ and Head Mistakes’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools revealed that 40 percent of the 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which had access to private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of the HMC, explained: “It is devastating that so many teenagers are being seduced into creating online rooms where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elidh Doyle will be “voice of the athletes” in the Scottish Sports Council
Elidh Doyle was elected to this annual General Assembly as a non-executive member in the Scottish Lichtatelletics Association Council of Scottish Athletics.
Doyle described the choice as a great opportunity for athletes to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
"Eilid is respected in the Scottish, British and World Community of Light Telecommunications and we are sure that the Light Telecommunications in Scotland would benefit greatly from their choice in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am happy to act as the voice of the athletes and hope that I will be able to make a real contribution and start sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won over 200 and 400 meters in 1996 at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, called his own four Olympic gold medals and today often turns out to be BBC experts, was no longer able to run after an excessive blood loss.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't run anymore.
The doctors say no one can tell me if or how far I'm going to enjoy it.
It was hard work, but I've completely recovered, learned to run again and make mobility exercises today!
Thank you very much for the comforting news."
Advertisement for milk pumps, which compares mothers to cows, ensures uplifting in the network
A manufacturer of milk pumps made the network with a werbeclip to compare it with the milk of cows.
For the market introduction of the so-called ‘first-hand milk pump’, the manufacturer of consumer technology Elvie has published not a very serious common music video in order to emphasize the freedom that the pumps offer mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a shade filled with tea in the background of a song containing text lines such as, "Yes, I'm milking, but you don't look at me" or, "if you haven't noticed, these are not yours, but my breasts."
In the refrain it goes on to say: “Pup it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies.”
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page has resolved a controversy on the network.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video focused on mixed reactions in the audiences, many of whom said that it was unharmed by the milk industry.
"It was a very bad decision to hire this product with kitchens.
Like us, they must become pregnant and bring up a calb to produce milk, with the difference that their boys will be taken away within a few days after their birth," it said in a comment.
Elvie's milk pump fits in a stilt-BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment said: “Superious traumatized for mother and baby.
But, hey, why don't we use them to steal a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added: "So a real-time advertising."
Others defended the advertising and gave a woman to find the song “urcomically”.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought one if I was still quiet.
I felt like a cow when I was pumping.
The Clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to interpret it.
That's a great product," a person wrote.
Another person commented: “This is an important advertising aimed at mothers who use milk pumps (or at work or on toilets) and feel like “kiss”.
This is no advertising for or against the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women shows that all had dancing with the discreet pumps in their BHs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who use milk pumps give themselves to feel like milk cows.
The pump of Elvie, however, is completely locked, has no tires or holes and fits discriminating in a steel-BH, thereby allowing women to be free to move to hold their babies or even go out during the pump process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, stated: “The pump of Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a waiting and provocative market introduction.
By comparing breast-feeding mothers with milk cows, we wanted to return milk pumps and all the related challenges to the medium point and at the same time to the sustainable and adequate way to present the incredible feeling of freedom that enables the new pump.
That's not the first time that Elvie's pump fell into the string.
During the London Fashion Week a double mother appeared for designer Marta Jakubowski on the Catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were still and lay in a tent city at the Texas border
The number of internally displaced children is as high as ever before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively similar, among other things, in which there has been a stronger rhetoric and the measures of the Trump government made it harder to bring children under control.
Traditionally, most caregivers were themselves illegal immigrants and are now afraid of becoming the target for a divorce when they sign up to adopt a child.
In June, the risk was announced by the Federal authorities that potential caregivers and other adult members of their household had to print their fingerprints and that these data were shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Customs Administration Immigration and Customs Force, announced before the Congress that the authorities arrested thousands of people who had been charged with the care of unaccompanied minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrestees had no previous entry into the criminal register.
“At least 80 per cent of the persons who are either a manager or a member of a manager’s household are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
That is why we will continue to follow these people," Albence explained.
In order to make the cases of children easier to deal with, officials introduced new rules that, according to employees of the accommodation in some children, required to appear within 60 days of the hearing before the court, which was previously standard.
Many will appear by video turnout and not personally to join an immigration judge for their legal status.
When negative decisions are made, the person will be released quickly.
As long as these children remain in danger, this is more likely to be reported by the accommodation workers as well as reports that have been known in the last month from the system that they are being abused and depressed, which can lead to violent explosions or explosions.
Defenders say that these concerns will be strengthened at a larger facility such as Tornillo, as there are signs that a child has a problem, because of the size of the child it will be easier to overcome.
They also explain that traumata, where many of the children are already suffering, can be strengthened if they are taken to a city of destination without emotional preparation or enough time to take up with friends.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish 'occupation' to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on the Syrian refugees to return to their homes, although the civil war in the country was still in the eighth year.
Moualem, also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that the foreign fighting forces, with the advance of the fight against terrorism, were illegal on Syrian soils and were “to be treated accordingly”.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he explained to the assembly.
Moualem claimed that the “war against terror nearly passed” was in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus “will continue to fight this holy battle until all the Syrian territories are destroyed” both by terrorist groups and by “all illegal foreign presences”.
The United States has stationed about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, training and counseling both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 underground calls in the war-affected country.
As for the refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return were given and he accused “some Western countries” of spreading “irradiated anxiety” to the refugees leaving home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to enable homelessness," he said.
"They are actually a purely humanitarian matter. "
The United States and the European Union warned that no aid would be granted for Syria unless there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey over a buffer zone in the last great Rebelenhochburg Idlib represents the possibility for the launch of political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned out to be a wide-ranging offensive of the Syrian armed forces supported by Russia to the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed his hope that military measures would be taken against dissidents, including from combatants of the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, which will be “cut off”.
UN Vice-President Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to invite the first meeting of a new committee soon to consist of government and opposition members to design a post-war treaty for Syria and to select the path to election.
Moualem mentioned the conditions of the Syrian Government for participation in the Committee and stated that its work should be limited to the "recast of the article of the current Constitution" and should be notified before accession.
Why Trump is winning his resurgence
With this logic, Trump would win its re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal observers may expect, pre-emptively end an official ruling or a scandal of his presidency.
This would certainly be “the most dramatic final of a presidency of all times”.
So far, there are no signs that it had set the visitors.
Since 2014, the number of allowances for the best delivery time at CNN has doubled to 1.05 million and almost 1.6 million for MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reaches an average of 2.4 million visitors to the best time of mission, compared to 1.7 million years ago. MSNBCs “The Rachel Maddow Show” led the closing rates with an estimated 3.5 million visitors to the Abenden with important news.
"This is like a fire that people magically draw, because it's about something we don't understand," said Neal Bear, showrunner of the drama series “Designed Survivor” on TV sender ABC on a cabinet member who will be the president after an attack on the capital.
Nell Scovell, an older comedy writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club” has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told you he'd choose Trump.
She asked him for the reason.
"He said, 'because he brought me to the lake'" told me Scowell.
Chaos has maintenance value.
Of course, the stories from Washington, in contrast to everything to be found on television, can determine the future of the fundamental decision on companies Roe v. Wade, the possible integration of families and the health of the global economy.
Engagement is a luxury that can only be enjoyed by the most privileged visitors.
In addition, it will be an informed citizen if you are aware of having already been exposed to an expert circle that uses sources from the so-called “Fear”, Paul Manaforts $15,000 treasure Bomberjacke from Straußenleader (called Washington Post a “Development piece of self-assessment”) or the effects of Stormy Daniel's traveling description of Trump, hmm, Anatomy.
For my part, I will never see Super Mario again with the same eyes.
“A part of what he does can feel like a reality show that he presents every night,” says Brent Montgomery, director-in-chief of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creators of the series “The Three From the Pfandhaus”, about rotating crews and daily behaviours (a fight with the football league NFL from the Zaun, Kim Jong-un prizes).
You can't make it happen, or you can't come with it anymore.
When I arrived this week, it was only 27 degrees in front of his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kaai, but he stepped down and looked at MSNBC while he recorded CNN.
He simply couldn't get rid of the screen, not if the judge's candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, stood shortly before the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court of Justice was at stake.
“I remember when we made all these crazy messages and the people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” I said.
"I thought it was a kind of white, but it turned out they were right."

It is little surprising that the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania will be transferred from funds, thanks to the renewed limits of the electoral region, which led to two officials standing in the race around the same seat.
The recently designated Prestadt District in Pittsburgh is allowed to represent the Democratic Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another region in the course of a special election last spring.
Lamb is against another official, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently losing the old 12 district of Pennsylvania, which is seriously breaking through with the new 17 district.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of the state of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old areas were exposed to the Constitution and were manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans.
The run in the new 17th district resulted in an exchange of savings between the major financial instruments of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb was known in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a multi-accompanied special election in March around the 18th electoral district of the state.
This session was held over a decade by a Republican and Trump won 20 percentage points.
Politicians have made the Democrats a simple guide.
The United States examines El Salvador's punishment for its support for China, but then back
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Peking had already recognised, without having to stand in great opposition from Washington.
Trump graduated in June 2017 from a friendly meeting with President Panamas Juan Carlos Valero and held a hotel in Panama to partner the management team of the Trump organization.
Officials of the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to withdraw the leaders of all American foreign affairs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the latest decisions to recognise Taiwan no longer”, said Heather Nauert, Minister's speaker at the beginning of a month's opinion.
However, only in the case of El Salvador, criminal measures, estimated at $140 million in 2017, were considered, including for drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed criminal measures, including cuts in financial assistance and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and mortality.
During internal meetings, North and Central American officials will move a high-level conference on security and economic well-being, which should follow a similar meeting in the past year and take a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from leaving the United States.
In mid-September, however, high government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and thus ended the consideration of the criminal measures for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled as a speaker at the conference held in mid-October in order to give a sign of the importance of the meeting's government.
The three American diplomatic representatives are silent and happy to return to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further written communications or criminal action from Washington.
A government speaker from John Bolton drew an opinion on the details of the debate, which was described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to participate in the internal discussions under the conditions of anonymousity.
Their views were confirmed by one of the government's close external analysts who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next big surprise could be the report of Specialist Robert Mueller on Tromps of possible judicial interference, for which there is now sufficient facilities in the public.
Mueller is now apparently also investigating whether Trump's campaign team with Russia has been conceived in its attack on the American elections.
If the majority of the Congress is to change, it is faced with a body that binds it to account, even though it is at the time when it prepares to re-enter the electoral office; and, where appropriate, before a voting jury.
These are many 'Winns' and I do not want to say that the case of Donald Trumps, or his European penance, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic we must make decisions that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officials were willing to carry out a coup against Hitler if the West had only opposed him and had supported the Czech Slovaks in Munich.
We have failed, and we have missed an opportunity to avoid the years of Barbarianism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unsustainable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are just ahead of several such turning points.
What do we do when Trump leaves the Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, so the man who decides about the future of Muellers?
Rosenstein has been in Teufel's kitchen since this newspaper has reported that he has been proposing to register the presidents secretly and speculating about it, but not suitable for the office.
Rosenstein demarcates the presentation of New York Times.
“How will we respond if the newly organised FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed in the office despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and misappropriation?
And above all, will we vote in the inter-elections for a convention that is forced by the trumpet?
If we fail these tests, we have a longer winter ahead of us.
But I think we won't fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovakia Jew who was deported to Auschwitz, although from the same regime that had once occupied my mission home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me 60 years later to release Sabath-Kerzen on the table with the hacking cross.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers Optimistic before the game against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Wien on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive remiss against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will be placed in a good position for the qualification of the Group G of Europe League.
Due to a breakdown, Graham Dorrans could not appear until 2-2 equality against Villareal, but he believes that the rangers of this result can be used as a springboard for larger.
"That was an important point for us because Villareal is very good," said the 31st year.
We went with conviction into the game that we could do something about it and we were headed home with a point.
Maybe we could still win at the end, but in general it was probably a good result.
They may have dominated us in the first half, but we have worked hard in the second half and were then the better team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, but this will be a hard part because they have achieved a good outcome in the last game. But I am sure that we can go through this with the public behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a sort of relief factor.
The team is good and the boys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can look forward to the last season behind us and be successful."
Fear of ageing care leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the participants in the survey knew exactly how to deal with them, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationalwide study offered to talk to your partners about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent offered to talk to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but do not take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Health Insurance Party.
This is why you should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family for it if you don't express your wishes on time.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how you want to be made, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor to board: Your consultant can also help you find an opportunity to finance these expenses.
Your long-term financial decisions may include a traditional care insurance, a hybrid capital-like life insurance to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets - as long as they have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Apply legal disputes in the last minute.
Instruct a precautionary authority so that you are commissioned by a trusted person to monitor your medical care and to ensure that the health authorities comply with your wishes, you should be able to express these yourself.
Consider also a full power for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who will handle financial decisions and ensure that your accounts are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Do not forget the details: Suppose your older parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about taking medicines or allergies?
Please note these details in a written plan so that you are ready.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a mighty earthquake and a tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, so the authorities had to raise the number of deaths.
As a result of the failed communication systems, aid forces were unable to obtain information from the Dondhia government district, a region north of Palu, located near the center of the earthquake with the strength of 7.5.
In Palu, over 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Dodhia on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a small bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Dodhea is a government area located in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi over a coastal area of over 300 km (180 miles).
In the government area, a administrative unit under the province, there were 299,200 people living in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of the Central Sulawesian economy, in particular the coastal region of Dodrea.
The Nickelbau is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesis.
Palu and Dodhra have been victims of earthquakes in Indonesia over the past 100 years.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami, which destroyed hundreds of homes in Dodrea.
In 1996, West Dongala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is situated on the seismic Pacific Firering, and is regularly searched for land.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra destroyed a tsunami on December 26, 14 countries and 226.000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean spent almost half of their lives in Aceh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes shocked the West Coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people die on the island of Nias before the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake with the strength of 6.8 struck the southern Javas, Indonesia's most affluent island and wiped out a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed almost 700 deaths.
2009: A earthquake struck Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with the strength of 7.5 struck one of the mentawai islands before Sumatra and wiped out a tsunami of up to 10 metres high, which destroyed thousands of villages and claimed 300 lives.
2016: A mild earthquake struck the government area Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, Tsunami was not dissolved, but more than 100 people were killed by one-stop building.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, which was popular for tourists, and called for more than 500 deaths on the north side of the island.
The bebes destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily scattered on the island.
Sarah Palins son arrested for the purposes of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Governor Alaska and former candidates for the office of Vice-President, was arrested on grounds of physical injury.
The 29-year-old Palin from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested because of the suspicion of domestic violence, the ban on the reporting of domestic violence and opposition to the government, as a report was published by the Alaska police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took off his phone when they wanted to understand the police.
Palin is located according to KTUU in the Mat-Su Pretreal Facility, and a 500-dollar loan was raised.
He appeared on the Saturday before the court where he, when asked after his lawyer, answered with “No blame, absolutely sure” the network.
Palin is accused of having three orders in Class A, which can be punished up to a year's imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000.
He will also be placed in charge of a class B orderliness that can be punished with a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017 he was ordered to have his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case will be dealt before the Veteran’s Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was subjected to domestic violence, the ban on the notification of a criminal offence and the possession of weapons under the influence of torture in connection with the incident.
His friend told him to shoot you in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by Veteran organisations after they returned her son’s behavior to a post-traumatic deterioration in Iraq as a result of his time.
Tsunami on Earth in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people die after a earthquake that the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was destroyed on Friday.
The bee with a strength of 7.5 dissolved a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communication networks are broken down and the number of deaths will rise in the coming days.
The ground floor is located just outside the coast of Central Sulawesis, located in the northeastern part of the capital of Jakarta.
On the social networks, videos circulatory from the time of the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when Tsunami hit the coast.
Federal government requires executions for suspects in New York's terrorist organization
The federal government in New York calls for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, who was charged with the terrorist attack in New York City, the eight lives. This is a rare punishment that has not been associated with a federal offence since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov is charged with using a rented pick-up from the construction chain Home Depot for a terrorist attack, where he raced on a road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and transported passengers and passengers in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the complainants must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “targeted” and “consciously” of serious physical injuries, so it is stated in the intentional statement for the death penalty requirement that was introduced in the South New Yorks.
Both charges could be punished according to the court document with the death.
Weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of Investigation presented a complaint in 22 points covering eight charges of murder against organised crime, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as a complaint about the use of force and destruction of vehicles.
The attack requires “the basic planning and premeditation” so that the complainants described the type of action carried out in the Saipov as “absolute, rude and intruding”.
“Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov added to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco damage, pain and loss”, said the statement.
In five victims, it was an Argentine tourist.
For over a decade, New York's southern district has not followed a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers and finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in New York at a federal trial was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married man, who was convicted two years ago of a spying for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were arrested on 19 June 1953 with the electric chair.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, testified in the days and months following the arrest of missing tires.
He told the investigators how to feel about what he's done, the police.
Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to do so after he had seen videos from ISIS on his phone, so the complaint was written.
He also called for police inputs to attach the prisoners of ISIS to his hospital room.
He declared himself guilty in all 22 cases.
David Patton, one of the federal prosecutors representing Saipov, stated that she was “sudden of course” because of the decision of the government.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty is to replace a debt in exchange for a life-long life sentence without the possibility of release, the trauma experienced by all participants will only be extended," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the accused not to demand the death penalty.
A member of the Conservative Party requests that NIGEL FARAGE forward the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage is forced to mobilize "the power of the people" today during a protest in the context of the Tories conference.
The former Ukip party leader stated that politicians "will have to feel the pressure" of the Eurosceptics, while a spokesman from Theresa Mays suggested that farage should lead negotiations with the EU.
The conservative central banker Peter Bonne told the demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be “already out” if Farage Brexit Minister.
The challenge faced by May in raising its deeply divided party was to strengthen the participation of members of your party, who are in the EU for a stay, in a separate demonstration against the Brexit, which took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems to maintain its framework of compromise in spite of attacks by Brexit, Brexit Genner and the EU.
As a result, Eurosceptic and the opposition working party should be forced to decide between their package and the ‘Chaos’ despite the opposition.
Bone explained at the “Leave Means Leave” demonstration in Solihull that “Checkers on the Müll”.
He suggested that a party should be appointed to a party and that he should be entrusted with the responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible for it, we would already be out," he explained.
The Commissioner of Wellingborough added: ‘I will agree for the Brexit, but the Chequers belong to the Müll.’
He stressed his opposition to the EU: 'We have not fought in world wars to be subversive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone argued that the public opinion has changed since the referendum in 2016: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and now want to remain in the EU is completely wrong.’
The president of the Conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also on the demonstration and told reporters: “I only say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is not popular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is disliked in our own party and in our activists who actually go through the streets and ensure that we are elected.
Please open the checkers and catch them to listen to."
In a strong message to May, she continued: ‘The Prime Minister keeps their jobs if you keep their promises.’
Farage stated in a statement that politicians should “press the pressure”, that they should just reject the decision of the 2016 referendum.
‘This is now a question of confidence between us, the people and our political class,’ said Farage.
'They're trying to break the Brexit, and that's why we're here today to say to them, 'That's why you're not coming.'
Before a desired number, he continued: ‘I want you to tell our political class, which is just ahead of you, to tell the Brexit, to let the pressure go.
“We mobilize the power of the people of this country, which will stop us from winning the referendum and will never come to peace unless we are independent, self-managed, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit-gigner was marched through Birmingham before they received a two-hour customer service in the city center.
A number of activists broke bands of the Tories Against Brexit Group, a group of Brexit Genners within May's party, called on the weekend in life.
Lord Adonis, the peer of the Labour Party, made himself curious about the tories which had security problems with a party app when the conference opened.
“These are the people who tell us that they can make sure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus, are available for the free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” Addons said.
'That's a farce.
There's just no good Brexit', he added.
Warren plant, presidential candidate 'to check'
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after the elections in November, they will "check the presidential candidate exactly".
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke on Saturday at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts about their future.

The police from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on the murder scene on the LSU basketball player Wade Sims from Friday.
At a press conference, the Baton Rouge Police Department announced that the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson would have been arrested at 11 o'clock in the morning.

Large price from Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after his team has left the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time that Valtteri Bottas landed on Saturday in Qualification in front of Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Stallororders of Mercedes would play a great role in the race.
From the Polish position from alongside Bottas a good start and it was almost as leading to Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and called on his team colleagues to join him.
Vettel first went into the box and stopped Hamilton on the road at the end of the train station, a decision that would have been decisive.
The Mercedes later went into the box and landed behind the Vettel, but Hamilton took over him after a short Rad-an-Rad-Mannover, where the Ferrari-Pilot tried to release the inner page, with the risk of two moves to defend the third curve.
Max walks started on one of the back places of the field and lay on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He was then for a large part of the race of the fastest, because he kept on his tracks to quickly finish and hold Kimi raikcons for the fourth place.
Finally, he went to the 44th round in the box and did not create a step in the remaining eight rounds while raikkon ended up as fourth.
It was a difficult day, since Valteri has had a great performance all weekend and how a true gentleman has dealt with me when he should have told me.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double face," says Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump made himself pleased at a election event on Senator Diane Feinstein, which required the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, in which this candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh was accused of sexual abuse, did not pass on to the press.
At the event in West Virginia, President Fords spoke not directly to the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that the proceedings in the Senate show that people are “common, wild and unfair”.
“One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has taken place in the Senate in the last few days is when you see the clouds when you see people, they are angry and angry and they are rude and unfair,” said the President.
“When you look at the leaks and say, ‘Oh, I wasn’t.
I wasn't."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, were you responsible for the Leak?
Think about your answer... Publish the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I haven't published it."
Okay, give me a minute.
Did we... no, we didn't publish it," he added as he took over the senator's voice.
Feinstein's letter with Ford's charges against Kavanaugh in July was published in early September. However, Feinstein argues that the Leak comes from her office.
"I have not forgotten Dr. Ford's charges, I have not published your story," Feinstein said to the Committee.
"She asked me to keep the letter secret and I spoke to her in secret."
Her dementia seemed not to be welcome to the presidents, who said on Saturday evening at the election event: “I tell you one thing that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continuing defense of the judge's candidate, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the Democrats claimed that the charges would be used for their own purposes.
"They are determined to withdraw the power by all means.
You see the community, the evil, they don't care who hurt them when they're under the wheel to get power and control," said the president, mediate.

In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the team back to the game after 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt Cownie stopped to his comparator after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer assured the Giantes' leadership before the half-time break when he arrived shortly before the end of the first half of his second gate of the night.
The home team was regrouped and Bouchard looked out again with a power-play transfer in the 28 minutes.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen bring Dundee into the party for the first time later in the second half. Nielsen then assured his team of victory with a fifth tower near half the second half.

Over 800 people die and many are lost after the island of Sulawesi was attacked on Friday by a devastating earthquake that wiped out a tsunami.
Strong afterbebebebebe is still in the region, and many people are trapped under drummers in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues have fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan refused to leave his posts in the heavily changing control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained to be sure that the flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was at the time of the start, was safe.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he thought he'd run away.
Agung died in the hospital later.
Johanne Sirait, speaker of the Indonesian Aviation Safety Service, stated that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as Australian ABC News.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We are deeply concerned about this message," he added.
At the same time, the authorities feared that the number of deaths could rise to several thousand. The country’s disaster protection authorities declared that access to the cities of Dodrea, Sigi and Boutong was limited.
“The number is likely to increase, as many bodies are still under the drums, while others cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Because with up to 6 metres high, Palu has moved, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.

Since you're ready?" so CNN.
Indonesia was already hit this year by earthquakes in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Air Niugini Airport in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports now from a missing airport crash in Lagune
The airline that carried out the flight, which crashed into a passive lake in Micronesia, is now reported by a missing person, after first claiming that all 47 passengers and the crew have been safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini explained in a message that she could not say anything until Wednesday about the stay of a passenger.
The airline offered to work with local authorities, hospitals and clinics to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew members after the aircraft was wrecked while trying to land on the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials left out that seven people had to be brought to a hospital.
The airline announced that on Saturday there were six passengers in the hospital but remained in a stable state.
The cause and the exact execution of the accident remain unclear.
The airlines and the U.S. Navy both state that the aircraft landed shortly before the landing train in the Lagune.
Some witnesses thought that the plane was flying over the country train.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was flying very slowly.
"This is a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others could swim on the sides of the sinking plane by means of heavy water.
He said that the pilots were shouting and screaming in panic and that he suffered a smaller head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that Matrosen, who worked near the improvement of an anchor station, had a floating boat to help bring people to the coast before the plane was sinking in about 30 meters (100 ft) deep water.
The aviation Safety Network data show that 111 people have been killed by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them affected Air Niugini.
Analyst rebuilds the night of a woman burning alive
On Saturday, the charges ended with the re-examination of a case where a man is supposed to have a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the American Ministry of Justice, said for hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how he rebuilt the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on their death night.
Rowlett said to receive position data from various phones that showed Tellis was together with Chambers on the evening of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, such as the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers, in which he offered to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford witnessed and said that he had not been in the city on the day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis had told the truth when he offered to be in Sanford's Pick-Up on this night, Sandford said he had lied, "because my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another objection was that Tellis offered to know Chambers at her death for two weeks.
But phone records indicate that they were able to meet for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis lost their messages, calls and contact information from his phone for some time after Chambers' death.
"He cut her out of his life," said Hale.
The defence is expected to begin on Sunday.
The judge concludes that the procedure will continue on this day before the jury.

Another black one?
New York Children’s Children’s Picture List
A New York child girl laments a couple for a discriminatory release after she received a misannounced message from the mother in which she accused her of being “one more black”.
The couple struggle to be racist and compare the legal struggle with “erpression”.
The two-year-old mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her admiration when she found out that the new day mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she attended her first day of work in 2016.
“NIEEEEEEEIN, NO ONE SCHWARZE”, wrote a text message to her husband, Plasco-Flaxman.
Instead of sending this to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice twice.
After acknowledging her fauxpas, she left the "Plasco-Flaxman Maurice" and claimed that the closed American daily mother had done bad work and she had been expecting a Filipino, so the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her work day and then sent to the house with a uber.
Maurice now accuses the couple of compensation for the release and claims for compensation for the $350 per day that she has spent over six months of work for which she was originally booked, but without contract, and for which she had lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do that," she explained the newspaper on Friday, "I know that discrimination is."
The couple showed back the racist propensities and argued that the release of the reasonable step was because they feared Maurice, after which they had taught them, could no longer be trusted.
"My wife sent something that she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," explained Ehemann Joel Plasco of the Post.
“But would you trust your children with someone against whom they were unaware, even if it was from sight?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the legal struggle with “erpression” and explained that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and was “in a difficult situation”.
"They want to interest such a person?
This is not very net," the investment banker added.
As the legal conflict continued, the couple were quickly condemned in the public and condemned to the social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
The sponsors of Paddington feared that readers would not identify themselves with a speech barrier, including a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It is difficult to translate into someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
Today it is very important with our knowledge of Paddington's great success today."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a small player to write the book of children, had no problem with it, would have been denied his work and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication after his death was “biterish” in the last year.
She explained that her father was secretly proud of the success of Paddington, whom she described as “a very important member of the family”.
"He was a very quiet man and did not cry," Jankel said.
“Because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child that made something special: you are proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he's seen Paddington's success like that.
Although he found and created him, he always gave Paddington himself the responsibility for his success."
My daughter died and I had to take her over the phone.
After the country, her daughter was taken to the hospital in Nice, Louis Pasteur, 2 where the doctors tried to save her life.
“I called regularly to say that it really looks bad and that the doctors missed her little chance,” says Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received the call from Nad, in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to be adopted by her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that you have given your doctors to keep your heart on the pumps, slow down and lose your body.
She was dead shortly before she died and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn't wait to do anything else, while I knew what was going ahead.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to get together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now suffered the loss of her daughter, together with the other passengers who had nothing to do with what she had done on board the plane.
"Someone knew it," she said.
I had to cut my head and trained me all the time over the walls.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I received this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
mourning women depend on cards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost a suicide victim strive to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hang on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and telephone numbers for consulting points.
Davis son Tyler was 13 when he started to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he started suicide.
“I don’t want parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she explained.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son was leading a promising career as a cook and he had an impressive bed.
“Each one knew him for his own sake.
Everyone said that his beds could retrieve a room."
However, he preached his work before his death because he was “in a really dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after the suicide of his 11-year-old brother.
Davis explained: "I always feared it might have an effect."
Davis has designed the cards “to show people that there are people who can go and talk to them even if they are friends.
Don't stay quiet. You have to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, whom she was with for 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't say he was down or depressed," she explained.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was at the bottom of the day of the Sabbath. When the children had taken their gifts away, he did not see them in their eyes or anything."
She said that her death was a great tragedy for her, but she had to say: “There is a lot of danger in the family.
It's embarrassing us.
But we all have to go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the Sweebe begins with findings
"I thought if we could actually get something like that, because he asked for a temporary and limited discovery, we might get a little input on Saturday," he said. He was afraid that the Committee in the political stand was "inconsistencies".
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want any findings from the FBI?
Your will can only go back to Timing.
On 6 November, only five weeks were left. If the Republicans were expected to break up badly, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to choose their husband in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush contacted the phone audience to call senators and to convince them to support Kavanaugh. He had worked in the White House for Bush and met with his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There is a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can join at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to decide on the same vote, and to confirm it for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean crossings under Kim
The number of North Korean passengers to South Korea has fallen to power seven years ago since Kim Young-un came to power, such as a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong, which is based on data from the South Korean Reunification Ministry, stated that last year 1127 passengers were registered, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park referred to stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices for human mugs as the main factors.
Pjengjang was not publicly involved.
The vast majority of the passengers from the north are finally offered the South Korean citizenship.
Seoul notes that since the end of the Korean War in 1953 more than 30,000 North Koreans have passed the border illegally.
Most flights across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, are easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the crossing to be more illegal than immigrants because as refugees, it often returns with violence.
The relations between the north and the south, which are technically still in war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two Heads of State met in Pjungjang, who were engaged in the negotiations on the established nuclearization.
This led to the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Young-un in June in Singapore, where they agreed to work on a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to be singled out for the first time," said Mir Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he is not suitable for the Office of the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called court candidates Brett Kavanaugh "hysterisch" and said he was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't deny the impression that a woman who had acted so would have been referred to as a hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate's Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh argued emotionally and in a way that he had abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually as both teenagers.
During his opening call, Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he screamed almost and stopped at trains when he spoke to his family and his high school time.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and called the charges against him a "great and coordinated robbery", organised by Liberals, who were hostile to Hillary Clinton's presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's statements proved that he could not serve the Supreme Court because they showed that he was superior to Democrats.
"I believe that he has explained himself to these statements and the way and the way he is going about the Clintons and Democrats," she explained.
Pelosi was late when she was asked if she would try to persuade Kavanaugh of the office, he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority of the representative's house.
"I will say so much: if he does not tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for his present case-law," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Auditors in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi further said that as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible decisions of Kavanaughs against the Affordable Care Act or the principle decision of conduct of Roe v. Wade, as he is regarded as a conservative judge.
In his hearing, Kavanaugh asked whether he would review certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"We do not need a hysterical, prominent person who goes to this court and expects us to say, 'I am not wonderful'," says Pelosi.
Women have to use it as a weapon.
It's a fair hassred, months and years of the rain that is over-skinning and it won't come out without wine.
"We laugh when we get angry," said Stone 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, and you?"
She added: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager and said that she was drunk when she was angry but had developed a technique. If she was angry and started to drink, she would say to the person she said: “They may think that I’m sad because I’m drunk.
I'm angry."
And then they just keep talking.
I found it great."
Trains are allowed as a valve for zorn, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in an office dominated by men, where I was burned one day because of an unexplainable cloud and by an older woman, an undercover manager, before I always had a little fear, was packed into power and taken to a wooden house.
"Don't let her ever see you win," she told me.
“They don’t know you’re a jerk.
They think you're sad and will be satisfied because they think you're going to go to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, a convention director from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when a ship's board named Monkey Business was discovered at an extraordinary event and its candidate returned, the most frustrated brokers argued that there was no reason not to consider the idea of the presidential candidate himself.
"This was not a well thought-in-depth decision," she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation ‘Schneewichchen and the seven oars’.
As the election struggle had already progressed, she was behind the media occupation and she was forced not to apply if she was not able to get 2 million dollars together.
It was an invisible struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who spent $1,000 on men, only supported her campaign with $250.
“Do you believe I get a discount?” she asked herself.
In the speech she announced, not to start an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her support, frustration over the system that made the media creation and the direct address of the voters so difficult instead of the delegates, as well as the tension over sexism, so that she was close to the trains.
“I could have admitted that I experienced a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls the press actions.
“I could have believed that the tax collector Kleneex was my sponsor.
I still remember asking myself what they would probably write on my gravestone.
"It's hot?"
Why Beijing could benefit from the US-China Trade War
The openings of the US-China trade war were overwhelming. Although the battle is not over long, Beijing could benefit from a grave between countries in a long term, my experts.
Donald Trump, the American President, set fire to the first warning committee at the beginning of the year when he committed important Chinese exporters, including solar cells, steel and aluminium, with penalties.
This week, the most important one, with new criminal duties on goods worth 200 billion dollars, has effectively affected half of all of China's imported goods in the USA.
Peking had to go back to the same way every time and had recently won a fine of five to ten percent on American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China is hard to respond to any US action and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economic power will soon collapse.
Washington would have meant to move to join, but a public engagement against the US would be too tasteful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, my experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, China can benefit from the effects of the trade war for a long time by reducing the mutual dependence of both economies.
“The fact that a fast political decision could create conditions for economic turbulence in both countries either in Washington or Beijing is actually much more dangerous than many observers have previously known,” says Abigail Grace, a scientist who focuses on Asia in the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, so the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in rebuilding the country’s war that lasted over seven years.
In a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the situation in the country would improve.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he explained.
The government is building again the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions have now been given for the voluntary return of refugees to the country which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and basics of life.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
More than six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government was pleased with the reconstruction of the country.
However, he stressed that there would be no provision for aid from countries that had supported the rebellion.
Europe won a victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the Ryder Cup 2018 and visited the USA team with an end of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National near Paris.

Europe won the crown back after the Danish captain Thomas Björn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to win the US.
U.S. Star Phil Mickelson, who had over a large part of the tournament problem, reduced his departure on the 16th train (Par 3) into the water and lost against Francesco Molinari.

The American Jordan Spieth was hit by the player with the lowest ranking in the team of Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all times with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t normally wear, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so lucky to get the hell back.
It's about the team and I'm glad to have contributed," said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He continues to compete with his Landsmann John Rahm, who won against the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1 in individual contests.
I'm so proud to have killed Tiger Woods, which I've been following since my childhood on television," said the 23-year-old frame.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup Billion of 13-21-3.
A remarkable statistics for one of the largest players of all time, which has won 14 important titles and will only be exceeded by Jack Nicklaus.
The team in the USA had the entire weekend to find the Fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have performed high-quality services throughout the tournament.
The American captain Jim Furyk said after a surprising performance of his team: “I am proud of the boys they have fought.
There was a time this morning when we had put Europe under pressure.
We didn't do anything about it.
It's for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players gave a good performance.
We will be regrouped, I will talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will look ahead.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be her captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We've been defeated."
