Eemeli Kouki led the Hurrikaan Home to open - Savo Volley another win
After seven years of man's pilot's flight from the Mestaruuslaiga, Hurrikana-Loimaa started at the 2018-19 residence when Raision Loimo died last night 3-0.
From Romania back to Finland, general player Emile Kouki was 22 points most effective at Hurrika.
There were some offices outside, but they didn't do it, and then a call came from Lima.
The time was quickly agreed tomorrow, Kouki said.
In the same way, Loimusa also played Tom Rumpunen's support for Koukia at 18 points.
The most effective feature of the campaign was the contract on the 17th floor of Samuli Kaislasalo.
The winning of the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience on the other side, and it led to an extra game.
We're not ready yet, but continuing the track is of course the goal, Kouki said.
Setting the Savo Volley to be effective
Miro Mättänen was 18 points most effective in Savo Volley when the team lost Voeremäl Vieremäl Vanta Ducksin 3-0.
Our game was especially exciting in the attack, but fortunately, we gained the victory.
At least I didn't have any information on any of the different charges when I played against my previous team, Máttänen said.
After four in the 3rd series of planes, Antti Siltala made 12 points during the 2000-01 series.
Chief Commander Jukka Tuvinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, that's all the time.
The good file was left out of the house.
Miro was a bitch, Silly also played a good game, Tuvinen said.
The previous duration of the battle was 2006-07, then he won the final victory of Pielavaden Samossa Tuvise as the prime minister at the same time.
Thiago Maciel was at Ducks' 14 points.
I'll be right back to Aka-Volley.
In the years 2012-13, Joni Mikkonen, who has won the score, has started a strong battle this far too.
Hakkuri made 25 points when Akaka-Volley took his long opening stand when he was transferred to Kokkola Tiikir 3-2.
It's been a long time since I started.
Today there was a murder near, because we were four times missing from 17-21.
There was some sort of confusion, and five times it came to the same place, Mikkone said.
Some time ago, while still in final processing, the most effective of the Tiikres had been made by hacker Edwards Buivids at 28 points.
Maanman Aleksandrs Kudjashaws supported 17 points.
There's no way to take anything from a friend's hacker.
Finland in comparison with human capital in the world
Finland is in the hands of the world in comparison to human capital, says the newsman Lancet.
The study compared human capital development from 1990 to 2016.
In the years, the country was compared to 195.
In both years Finland was the only statistical unit.
In 2016 there was almost the same as in 1990.
Later in Finland, there were Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
He later settled in the Netherlands and found Taiwan on the list instead of Canada.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan were the worst in comparison.
When I look at human capital, I look at the level of public education, access to the educational boundaries, skills and health.
The World Bank has been in the hands of human capital in connection with economic growth.
Real Madrid Thibaut Courtois held at Atletico's race, the local game ended in a stateless state.
The Real Madrid painting of Thibaut Courtois to the Veni vengeful adventures, and the local Madrid team's game ended in a dismal level later that evening in the Spanish football game.
Atletico Madrid of Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were close to the ground, but the Belgian coast was still under attack in the Court.
Courtois played at Atletico three times as a Chelsea player.
In the beginning of the year, the International Football League Fifa selected him as the champion of the year.
In the real world, Gareth Bale got the best ground, but his shift was finally over at the end of the day.
Bale left behind after the storm because of the more frequent journey.
According to the ESPN, the counterfeit Realists also called the name Christian Ronaldo on the move to Juvents.
In the United States, we are now being attacked against the right to abortion - A powerful document tells us why
In the United States, the Senate was trying to find out if one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could choose President Donald Trump as the candidate for Mr. Brett Kavanaugh.
On the part of the Republican side, many hope that Kavanaugh's decisive voice would be accompanied by a decision on the name of Wade, which took place in the United States from the legal proceedings in 1973.
Ricki Sternin and Annie Sundberg's documentary team Reversing Roe - U.S. and abortion rights tell us how the situation has changed over the years.
As incredible as it feels, the subject is timely in Finland too.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sini) has done public work against the safe abortion and has received special support from our country's sponsors.
At the beginning of the powerful document, gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has been left the only abortions in the Member State of Missouri, is found.
The client's armed guards are telling the U.S. freedom of religion.
News videos remind clinics of terrorist attacks.
Let's move back to the time when the abortion was legal in the United States.
The association of the Lutheran Churches was then known as the presence of abstinence doctors who trusted women.
The reasons for the interrogation pastor are good, but they don't even need to be photographed by an abortion of a dead woman.
The deaths were in the United States about 5,000 years ago.
In particular, the Republican parties were protected by the legislation of abortions.
In 1967, Governor Ronald Reagan signed an abortion law in California.
Later called Reagan, at the 1980 presidential election campaign, he became a turning point in bringing religion into chaos by political voters.
His Aborttics also surrounded his followers, George Bush, his parents.
And so did Donald Trump.
The most serious document on the subject is to look for a basis for an abortion policy.
When there was no tax exemption from religious organizations that supported road treatment, they became politically active.
As a couple, they chose an abortion.
The religion has brought exceptional political solutions.
In writing this, the U.S. is in a situation in which the voice of a serious concern, but the voice of religious justice by an abortion, the President has chosen the highest right to appeal to Kavanaugh, which many women now accuse of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh can be granted the authority based on the language of the language to decide 164 million American women's and girls' rights.
Israel's army shot seven Palestinians, a group of two children, with great intelligence
About 200 Palestinians have been killed in the year Israel has become a nationalist.
Israel's soldiers shot seven Palestinians on the Gaza Strip on Friday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health tells them.
There are two children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, who are 12 and 14 years old.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been injured.
Ninety-eight of them were killed by nature.
The army of Israel has confirmed that it opened the gate and made a declaration to the border, when the conspirators threw down Israel’s armies with stones and with arrows.
The army says that when it begins its exercise of force, it is not intended by the petitioners to break the border line or push it to the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza's Opinions after March, when Palestinians launched weekly Opinions at the border.
The victims are 12,000 under the United Nations Human Rights Authority.
The commentators called for access to the Palestinian armies to the areas from which the Palestinians had to leave when the State of Israel was established in 1948.
A Palestinian spy shooter has killed one Israeli team.
Explosives from the Palestinian side have been carried out in forests and agricultural areas in Israel.
Theme Pukki got a penalty shot - you couldn't shoot yourself.
Wigan's superintendent, Chey Dunkley, looked like he'd lost him back in the back of the prison.
Specialist Gavin Ward gave the game a move.
According to his interpretation, the office was clean.
The task of Pukki couldn't believe his eyes.
The situation would have been difficult for Mr. Wardi, who sentenced Norwich to 85 minutes of imprisonment when Pukki was released.
Ward seemed to be a victim, and Mario Vrancic needed a 1-0 battery.
The ball's been made to Norwich in five lands in the Mediterranean.
The previous one was born last Saturday against QPR with a typical breast-feeding.
The job was for Pukki again.
When the ball was lost, he went on to the end of the situation.
He created the conditions for food, and he protected himself from fatigue.
Norwich's assignment was five weeks.
The group's going to keep going.
There's a five-way fighter on the back.
The Pedophile Help Service was immediately filled with supplies - in Finland about 40,000 experiences of interest to children
According to the estimate, at least two percent of men and a small part of women experience at least some of the sexual interest in preteens.
In Finland this means about 40,000 people.
To date, it has been difficult to get help from children or young people who are sexually interested in sex.
Support for criminal care and the SeriE joint SeriE project train professionals to meet pedophiles as a customer and help people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the morning, advice and therapy began to be provided at Sexpo, and the meeting was quickly completed, Yle tells.
However, they are allowed to measure the amount of the disease released.
Sexual fantasies involving children cause many shame.
Most of the pedophile feelings in themselves have not taken their fantasies into account and have thus done nothing criminal.
However, the opinion is generally a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get away from thinking that bothers them and makes them tired.
They also challenge normal life, says Ms. Patricia Thesleff, who works as a special expert on the project.
I think the work is valuable if one child is saved from sexual violence, Thesleff says.
Korean leaders or Congolese gynaecologists?
In the United States, President Donald Trump Nobel won the Nobel Peace Prize - the idea may suddenly sound strange, but Trump is one of the most popular awards.
The summit has a role to play in achieving North Korea, at least at the level of borders, to be committed to the nuclear community.
The greatest recommendations for peace as the Nobel Peace Prize are based on reports by President Moon Jae of South Korea and President Kim Jong of North Korea, who have already met three times this year and have made an effort to enter into a peace agreement between their countries.
The warmth between the Koreans is remarkable, since in recent years there have been some interesting developments.
Nevertheless, for years the award of Kim, which leads to nuclear destruction and global warming, would no doubt raise the criticism.
The Nobel Prize winner will be published from the bottom of the earth, and on the afternoons, there will be the focus of the peace Prize.
If the reward is not given to Koreans who participate in the diplomats, there is one of the most promising Congolese doctor Dennis Mukwege.
In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the estimated gynaecologist has treated thousands of women and adults who have been victims of gang rape and have become experts in the world.
Mukwege has focused his work on sexual violence, which is the sad result of many conflicts.
A strong proposal has also been made to the United Nations refugee organization, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has said this year that 331 proposals are being made.
The names of the candidates will not be publicized.
Trump wouldn't be wrong if Nobel got it.
In May, the supplier asked him in the White House if he should think of the peace agreement.
Everyone likes it, but I'd never say it myself, Trump said it in a smile.
I want to get this ready.
I would like to congratulate the whole world, but the President continued to refer to North Korea's negotiations.
There are, however, steps that make Trup's Nobel Prize inconsistency.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee to decide on the election has often given recognition to individuals and organizations representing liberal democracy and a multifaceted world order - just for international cooperation, which was seen as an opposition to Trump.
By the year 2000, the award has been awarded three United States policies, all of which have been democratic: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
The reward of the team was therefore required by the Nobel Committee for a comprehensive ideology.
Fire alarm in hours: Cars used as drivers and walked wrong direction
On 8 September, a single truck hit by Lohja.
The traffic in the tunnel was interrupted because of the announcement, both in Turu and in Helsinki.
When it became clear that this was a system-wide problem, the company tried to make the transport normal.
However, it didn't work very fast.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Centre said that it could not be opened, because there are drivers on the road so much and they wonder how it is going, the day-to-day pilot Pasi Käriyanen told the STT immediately.
The engine was then sent to the wrong direction only after a moment of waiting.
When the first starts to act against traffic rules, a few others follow often after, the Transport Security Liaison Officer, Tapio Heskanen's surprise.
According to traffic rules, motors and tunnels must not be stopped for any reason.
Transport security recalls that in exceptional situations there is no risk of transport in emergency solutions.
The warning vehicles must always make the most possible stopover.
On the other hand, the temporary motor vehicle has been specifically prohibited, as well as the construction of the u-turn and withdrawal.
The same prohibitions are also valid in tunnels, in addition to which air traffic must always be connected.
It is also prohibited to stop without an offering, as it is true, to stop.
There have even been cases in which the driver has stopped driving the world by car.
It should be clear that there is a wrong place and time for this activity, Heskanen says in the Transport Safety Communication.
The Ilves fans would have wanted to keep on celebrating, even if the ship was stuck in the bottom of the sea.
The Ilves fans of the inner ship M/S Tampere would have wanted to remain on board the ship in the course of the victory, even if the ship had remained on board at sea, told the ship’s captain of the ship that he had worked during the event.
From the train to Tampere, M/S Tampere was later thinking about leaving his train on Saturday morning and stuck in the bottom of the Old Water in Aakak.
There were 19 passengers on board, and five men were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one's been in trouble.
The Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their party until tomorrow morning, but certainly it would have been wiser to send them on the boat to the airport and by bus to the house, Sirja told the STT.
The Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlin, followed by Ilves and HPK, which ended in 4-3 votes.
According to the surgeon, Saturday afternoon the drought caused the water surface of the Old Sea was about half a meter below normal.
Navigation was also difficult for Sir, as was the case with the fact that almost a small sign was hidden from the locker, which led to the lack of regular visibility in the dark.
No mention of noise
A few days after the shipyard had landed between Tampere and Helsing, the port of Havre was on the west side of the Russen Valley.
The most dramatic event was not associated with Sirj, as the speed of the ship was very low in the course of the event and the capacity of the ground did not cause the most significant disturbance.
According to the sailor, the landing on the ground has not caused ships to fall and no pressure and the crossings of the ship are going on normally.
In the morning, the sailor went to check on the ship’s crew before the ship was caught off course.
We're still on the TV for sure that there's no damage to this, Sirya tells us.
Sirä believes that the next M/S Tampere, the first week of the week-long walk, can be treated appropriately.
The ship's cross-section continues to take place on its own date.
Not used for ambulances
The rescue plant received a warning on Saturday morning shortly after the 20th.
On Friday, ambulances were warned to take away missing passengers, but the ambulances were not used.
The day-to-day prime minister Matti Willman later told me that the conditions on the sea were difficult because of darkness and almost severe wind.
The rescue facility was informed by the second half of the second half of the month on the opposite night that all the crew on board had been evacuated and passengers had moved to Tampere by line.
In 1957, the passenger was built in the preceding nine years, in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
The Court of Justice of Trump, responsible for the arrest and arrest, may be guilty of a criminal offence.
Britt Kavanaugh, the Supreme Justice of the United States, may well remain responsible for his aim, according to programmer Mika Aalola of the Foreign Policy Institute.
To date, at least three women have been accused of sexual harassment and abuse during their studies.
According to Aaltola, doubts have brought so much political pressure on the Republican side that President Donald Trump may decide to present an official to another person.
In the United States, the President's motion for a Supreme Court has been severely challenged.
In this case, the judge's case is usually taken by himself, says Aalola.
The President has thus been able to maintain his growth.
Name should be added to the list of democracies
In the United States, the highest right is to be on top of politics, but at least in the case of Kavanaugh, a new judge's election has become politically very difficult.
If Kavanaugh is named, the decision will probably be sent by Aaltola to the Democratic Party in the future in the middle of the Congress.
It would raise the voice among young people and women, who would probably vote for more democracies.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the highest law would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
This is not a case for the presidential board, as judges of the Supreme Court in the United States are designated alive.
In practice, some of them have left their claim for retirement at the age of 70 to 80 years.
Part of the Republicans are also wrong about the name
In the United States, the Supreme Court of Justice is normally informed of the facts of the case.
Although Trump has only set a week's deadline for the FBI's additional list, it can still present an existing one, according to Aaltola.
Yes, it can.
It's late for the summer without coming, says Aalola.
According to Aaltola, it is at least certain that Kavanaugh's compatibility or inconsistencies will be discussed in advance before the Senate decides.
The Republicans have a majority of 51-49 votes in Senate, but at least two women's Republican senators are suspiciously referring to the name of Kavanaugh.
It would be unfortunate that the name would be put to the vote and the Republicans would be destroyed.
A woman identified Salisbury as a military intelligence agent
A Russian woman has been told by the general radio company to the BBC about Salisbur's shocks as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service.
On the basis of the photos, the woman said that there was a military communication with Anatoli Tshepi, who worked at GRU.
The net community of Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia told them earlier about the other suspicions of suspicious men in Chephigas.
They had already said that they had found evidence that men's personality is a secret personality.
The BBC team traveled close to Russia and China on the border with Chepea.
A woman living in the village was introduced to a picture of young Chepigan Bellingcat.
He introduced the same man to the British police, where he was presenting as a man who is now known as Ruslan Boshirov.
The Russians are suspicious of the threat of former Lieutenant Sergei Scriptal and his daughter at Novitshok-hermomyrk in March.
The scissors found out in the air.
Overst Chepe has been rewarded, among other things, at the celebration of Russia's Sankar in 2014.
The Russians still challenge the suspected GRU connection.
In September, suspected suspects told Russia’s TV interview in Salisbury as a tourist.
Adults as refugees in the Soviet Renewal
Now there is a living example of what the Government of Cyprus has defined in the context of the military reform reform.
The Valala army services are produced by Oulka, who is a health service director elected in 2016 by the former Regional Director of Attendo.
The Presidents of the Republic shall notify the authority of the amendment.
If the military is now rising, the state forces will be launched in the future.
As the central authorities moved, most of them were also prepared for the major restructuring of the population, which would end the health centre's plant and small memory unit.
In addition to home care, which means long-term care in the selection of people living in a private home, they are forced to travel to the nearest health centre for the "home" treatment.
Attendo believed that the government would pay for it.
The left hand was not a bad preparation, but a good public opportunity, which became a lot of property, close friends, and also the authorities of other parties.
I presented the parts of the military-country preparation, how the state of Valala is currently dealing with people at home most in the Northern Hemisphere.
There was also Carina Läntinen, who was also entrusted with the responsibility of the neighboring community.
The local court made a great deal of an opportunity, and once again it was the producer of Oulkara in the backyards.
Soldiers don't write to any paper that Attendo has built a new Valalaa shelter, which is now waiting for empty residents.
There are no other service producers.
The manufacturers are only talking about service providers, but they do not tell you what level of treatment it will receive or what staff structure Attendo needs to care for the benefit of human beings.
Without hospital care?
This is because there is no doctor’s day-care centre.
Attendo should also be provided with medical care at the Vaala Health Centre.
The example of the option tells us how central officials are turning the authorised unauthorized information and the authorities are being kept clear on the contrary by the change of the wall.
Thus, the central part of the Wall is emptying the inhabitants of the Wall, for who will remain there safely to live freely if there is a chance to change.
Was there a choice I had to discuss that the whole country would be treated as a substitute?
Turkish President Erdogan opened the Grand Duchy in Cologne
In Germany, thousands of people in the city of Cologne have expressed their opinion when Turkish visiting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened the largest mosque in Europe.
Hundreds of people had gathered to Reinjo's beach this morning.
Erdogan is not healthy, including in the minds of the commentators, and in the sculptures a fascist was condemned.
During the visit of Erdogan torstane, several opinions have been made, and security measures have been difficult.
On the streets, about 10,000 people were expected to protest, including Turkey's human rights regime.
Erdogan’s supporters had also been gathered to the Grand Duchy’s neighborhood.
However, the police had separated a large part of the Moscow area from the security environment.
In his opening speech, Erdogan called for the success of its visit to Germany and assessed its strong relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his tour, Erdogan met with Angela Merkel's liaison officer.
Erdogan and Merkel re-connaissanced their constructive relations with countries which had significantly deteriorated in 2016 by the Turkish government.
However, the sign emphasized that there are serious differences between countries, including in relation to human rights issues.
The assessment covered the visit
Both Mayor of Cologne, Henriette Reker and Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westfalen, Armin Laschet, took part in the openings when the assessment of Erdogan's visit was appreciated.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, told Erdogan about his visit to Switzerland.
I want to have a voice for those who can't go to the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed, tortured.
For Erdogan, everything that excludes his own thinking is terrorism.
The most important part of the population in North Rhine-Westphalia in the recent phase of the Erdogan German campaign is Turkey.
In Slovakia, three charges against the supplier's murder
Three people in Slovakia have been charged with the murder of the supplier Jan Kucia.
On Friday, the prosecutor said that three people were charged with the murder of Kucia and this bloody murder and other crimes.
Earlier this week, the police arrested eight people in an investigation, but five of them were released.
Kucia was found in February, with her comfort in her home in Bratislava.
He's been studying the links between politicians and Italy's Mafia.
The police have doubts about Kucia's findings regarding the murder.
The death and the article published by Kuciaki has raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems in the area of the railway station during the day.
As a result of the loss of the result, on Sunday the Karjaline is also required to be posted as uncertified.
This may be seen in the distribution of the paper in the field of asylum institutions where distribution to communities is required to be carried out from abroad.
The situation was on the same night for the newspaper, and the problem may continue as a country.
The post office puts extra paperboards in the country.
Other Finnish newspapers are posted separately as frozen yesterday.
The distribution of these papers is getting more and more emotional.
Water is a Finnish astronaut
Operator Arto Nyberg is currently challenging the upcoming debate programme, including Vesa Heilaa.
In the study, the water is the result of an outer layer that he stole from Virginia Galactic in 2010.
The price rose to EUR 151,000, which was needed as a banknote.
If the original plans had been in place, the water would have been in space for a long time.
However, the date of departure has expired over the years.
Now it is apparent that after the training required by the accident, the accident and the death penalty in 2014, things are in order.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will still start this year or the last year.
The number of water flights is 300, which is the time of his journey from the first departure of about a year.
The plane lasts 2.5 hours and is 5 minutes at 100 km high, the Finnish astronaut tells about his future home.
In the same way, he also finds his way into space.
As a child, I read about the name of Avarousmatka and saw Star Trek series televisions.
The war of stars has been seen, and that's why it's got to be...
Why not?
Everyone's got their own wound.
Manchester City was a quiet old man
Manchester City went on to go to Valio when it disappeared at home in Brighton, 2-0.
The six winning winners of the ruling Masters team are represented by the painters Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero.
Sterling was able to drive his fourth trip from the closet to the empty land when Leroy Sané found him in 30 minutes from the back of Brighton.
Aguroro sent his own painting to the address when he and Sterling went back to Brighton's defense in 65 minutes.
Argentinian was able to install 2-0-terminated sentences in an easy way.
With six victories and one level of distance, City will run the Valioliiga at 19 points.
However, one less player played Liverpool in just one point.
Liverpool will meet in the afternoon at his own seventh round of the Chelsea series.
Young People Ask...
The Finnish Youth Ministers elected new judges at their Sunday meeting for the next three-year period 2019-2021.
The president was elected from Anu Sivonen to the Supreme Savone and Vice-President Petra from Mäkeläne Hämee.
The Board of Directors has been elected to 40 members and 40 members, the Finnish Youth Council will be informed on Sunday.

Lewis Hamilton went over the Kimi Country and surprised Ferraria: "It's going to be a very important driver"
The Swiss newspaper Blick questioned Mersu from the British University of Mersu, he believed that liberation from the services of the Kimi Country would help Hamilton finish.
Hamilton leads to the MM points of Ferrari from the other coast of Sebastian Vetteli at 40 points.
Less than three weeks ago Ferrari said that the country did not continue to play in the first place, and the same country was informed that it had moved to the Saubers.
Hamilton doesn't believe that the Nationals would find their nests firmly.
I don't think Kim's going to change the rest of her life.
He's an extraordinary professional, fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorites, and I'm sure Ferrari is missing a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has previously said that the League has been one of his predecessors.
I don't know if Kim knows this, but when I was young and vulnerable, I played the F1 game at PlayStation all day long.
I was always Kim, which is time crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 house continues on Sunday in Russia's participation.
At 14 o'clock in the afternoon, Mercedes's State of Bottas will leave.
It's been a long time since I've been in the middle of the night.
A-new SM in the football field became a complete race: the opponent reached the ground with only 7 players.
The top level of the football boys ends in the evening, where they play the last round of the street.
Prior to the start of the 13th round, the starting points for the master-level competition were clear: FC Mayti Akatemía is able to make it easy to apply to the Vasa IFK.
In order for the situation to be changed in the last cycle, Ilves, the second in the field of cross-border competition, must be able to overcome PK-35 and expect the loss of solvents.
However, false masterdom was ensured in practice before the launch, as Vasa IFK had achieved only seven players.
If there had been only one, the procedure could not be started.
FC Lahti Akatemia won the appeal 16-0.
At the table, the legislators lead 7-0.
One reason for the needy player is that the team has played part in the same player's SM series, P20 series, and Cakkosen C section.
The left IFK has played in Kakkos in practice against the collapse of the entire length.
During the two rounds of the evening, Vasa IFK has to defeat the JBK in the neighbourhood and at the same time hope that Tampere United will destroy its association with KuFua in Siilinjärven.

Good luck with the information, actually.
According to the rescue facility, the road was marked by a trace of the port.
The police party went to an accident site.
Supo expects new means of communication: Device purchases and prescriptions already made, not removing external planning

Sopo's head of the assembly, Antti Pelttar, tells the Lännen Media that future information privileges have already been provided for the equipment.
Serena Williams is surprised by the video where she sings in the classrooms, campaigning for her career.
The superhero Serena Williams will meet again.
Now he campaignes to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing an Instagram video where he sings his hands in front of his breast, says the news agency AFP.
Kappale is an Australian named The Divinyls in 1991 hit I Touch myself.
The video Williams supports Australia's breast-feeding certification.
"I was surprised by The Divinyls' global hit to remind women to regularly carry out self-checks of [the rings]," Williams writes in his Instagram message.
And yes, this put me in the area of disability, but I wanted to do it because it concerns all women regardless of their skin color in the world.
A temporary discovery is all a and o - it's saving a lot of lives.
The Divinyls' second author is Chrissy Amphlett, who died five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project that has been made to honor Chrissy Amphlett.
"He went to his breast-feeding party, but he gave us a hitchhiking to remind us of women to wear their health for the first time," Williams says.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was published early Monday morning.
The video comments show William's courage.
Williams left this week away from Peking's service.

The restaurant was opened to the guests on 19.9.2018.
Youtube comments are surprised where the restaurant is located.
The failure of the restaurant requires a good Nordic, where appropriate.
The image of the ball ends today: That's how it ends
Everything's gonna be all right in time.
Today, this is the case with a local painting drawing of Corpela, which has been very popular.
Three production cases have gone like six stones: last week, he viewed television as the first of 722,000 Finnishs.

So far, the last wish will come to the public, which will get a woman's corner.
After a week on Sunday mornings, the new section of Soryon will continue.
I'm on TV1 today at 21.05.
Would you like to go to work in a small stream tomorrow?
This is the facts for and against
It's hot.
A lot of Arpo's gonna stay home or not.
However, the work force supports the idea of supporting others to cope, as the disease can be affected, even if its symptoms are small.
On the other side of the river, the symptoms of the flu are spreading slowly between them.
In the next option, you may already have others, even if your symptoms are small, tell the Prevention release.
So do you want to stay home?
According to Prevention, the flu must be affected even when a person has no symptoms.
The virus is already scheduled for a day before the outbreaks begin and forward from five days a week.
Children may be more likely to suffer from disease.
As soon as you're aware of the symptoms, you shouldn't be in school or at work.
You can get back to work when you're tired and you're not hot anymore, Professor Gregory Poland says.
Training also supports avoiding.
It's too fast to return to the island to slow down.
In addition, wash your hands, wash your hands in the snow, and throw your paper into the rock.
But you're not going to move?
If the code has to be removed as a disease, consider using it seriously.
Maybe you don't like viruses in your mouth, but you want to be a user in the area of your head.
Then there's not gonna be a symphony or a mouth, Poland says.
The brains are also limited to the machine.
How, then, can you avoid harassment?
The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid growing up.
However, it is difficult to avoid the consequences.
For example, in the United States, the average exchange rate is between the eye, the nose, or the mouth in 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
The new Miss Finland says again: "My husband is a resident student"
Students and Misses are often joined together.
The same was true of Alina Voronkova, paragraph 23.
In 2018, Miss Finland has received an Alina Voronkova at home in Pertuma.
Beautiful is now living in Lahde, where he changed when he was 15.
Alina's mother is an Englishman and a Russian father.

My mother and father had changed 25 years ago to Finland, but I was tortured for being a Russian.
I've never had any friends in my home country, Alina tells Miss Suomi in the media of the separatist media.
After the ceremony, Alina decided to start the kitchen clean and change the lathe to go.
I found some new friends, and the paper went down with hope.
Then, at the age of 15, she thinks she's an adult, but after this, I haven't really thought about it.
Three years ago Alina met her current partner Jonas Hurrin , who has been known for the Pelicans Rivers.
After the SM's urn, the resident student has played outside, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was in the Finnish team at 18-year-old MM.
In the early days of the marriage, the couple were in a relationship for nearly a year, but later, Alina went to travel with her husband to the world.
If I got into the winner's club and then I'd be proud of it, I don't want to believe it would affect our relationship in any way.
Although we would have to live differently, so we act with confidence well, and in the long run, there is a good side that the beginning of the story remains beyond the time, and Alina grew up in May.
I'm happy to continue growing, to die on our knees.
Almost everything is concerned about the sustainability of the world.
Still, I don't want to give up anything.
Sustainable options are sought for continued growth, but the theory of the judiciary also poses major problems.
The continuing growth of the economy has led to a few generations of ordinary people, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, a life that was just before being conquered by dreams.
The long-term overarching and climate change of the world will, however, be a threat to this market economy.

The police are also looking for suspicions about other incidents.
The events will be examined as an enterprise and a plot of evil.

British Eddie Hall was a forested man who was the most powerful man in the world for a long and definite term.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 pounds [10,000 kg] of food a day and weigh as much as 200 pounds [200 kg] according to Mirror.
The blocks were full of 5XL.
Hall accepted the physical damage he suffered before he was entitled to win.
Human health has not been created to be all of this, Hall said.
The British forested the world's strong man who won all the ways and the family man promised to end his urine, if I could get a title.
Hall didn't want his child to grow up without a father.

The restaurant M/S Tampere dragged the car into the Holy Sea - "Sustained with a stone"
The interior ship M/S Tampere drove to the streets later on Friday morning at Akalla St.
The rescue plant received a warning of the water pollution in the morning and afternoon after two and a half days.
The 30-meter M/S Tampere has been thought of by the murderer, and is firmly attached to his leg with a stone, described by the daily chauffeur Matti Willman.
There were 19 passengers and five men on board.
According to the rescue facility, personal injury was avoided.
Travellers and almost all members of the crew have been evacuated from the ship.
Now they are being transferred by line car to Tampere, the day-to-day chief told Jari Nieminen STT one night later.
On Friday, ambulances were warned to take away evacuated passengers.
For some reason, the ship traveling to Tampere had been thinking of leaving his boat on the west coast of God’s village.
The police will find out the cause of the events.
The day-to-day prime minister Matti Willman told me last night that the conditions on the lake are difficult because of darkness and almost severe wind.
According to the rescue facility, the ship's judgment is incorrect.
It's obviously not raining.
The applicants will start after the evacuation operation to check what the situation is at the base.
In 1957, built by M/S Tampere, there is an inland waterway currently operating as a restaurant, with a maximum allowable travel capacity of 180 people.
The ship also has a meeting to be held in private.
According to the ship’s websites, the passenger has been launched in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
This looks like a coincidence this morning and tomorrow.
The sun’s darkness is red and the sandy beaches are the most important of our land, and the sea in the West Finland is expanding and becoming more sundial.
It's a lunch break.
The temperatures are between +7 and +12 degrees, in the North Sea.
In the south and the central part of the country, the sea is rising and can become a weak spring.
There's a lot of fat in Lapi, too, but most of the time, it's broken.
The sun is on the north side.
The temperature of the day varies from the south to the 10th degree from feeling near the North Lap.
Ex-managers require Robert Hellenuk to pay unpaid wages
Recruiter Robert Heleneus' night of work against Erka Teper is saving money.
Tonight-Sanomat announced today the release of Jaakko Helms and asset manager Jussi Kokkila of the challenge, where Helenöläläl gave up a total of over €80,000 of unpaid managerial loans.
According to the questionnaire, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Hellenuks 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We've tried to agree, but there's no other option.
There's been a clear performance here, and there's been a lot of work done, Kokkila says to the Night-Sanom.
The current manager of the hall sent Markus Sundman to the night response, where he told the event about the sight of the trainer.
Hellenius argues that he is obliged to pay the amount required.
According to the answer, Kokkila and Helmin had offered financial support to Helenuks and promised to be able to organize his services and sponsors.
It was said that Hellenius was obliged to pay wages only as a percentage of his wages.
It was again assured that Hellenus needed nothing to pay but to receive the income they had arranged for.
This is also normal and the only practice in the management of professionals.
It has never been agreed upon and would have been more consistent in the case of Heleneus, the Sundman will find out in his message.
Cooperation has never been made under a written agreement.
According to the answer, Helenius had originally wanted to begin with the agreement in writing, but Kokkila and Sundman were first created by the end of 2014.
He endorsed the proposal on his own behalf and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helms.
Hellenius was not involved in his dealings with Kokkila and Helms.
After a year of cooperation, Hellenuks had been shown to be "individual but disproportionate" counting on the manager's work.
This year, the vote has been raised on the same charges.
Hellenius considers the subsequent actions of Helms and Kokkila to be harsh, in contrast.
Today, Hellenius is headed by the IBF’s seven-year challenger at Erka Teper in Stuttgart.
A Heartfelt Man and a Good Provider
Artist and music producer Open "Ile" Vaino was known as the previous radio player and supplier Erkki Päll for decades.
A long line radio generator and supplier Erkki Pölli died at 83 years of age without improving his payout.
The driver's death certificate was published on Sunday in Helsinki, Sanomi.
The notification shall inform Pöll's death on 3 September.
On the Facebook page in March 2018, Dölli reported a serious illness.
At that time, Ile Vaino also saw information about the fate of the court.
He's already left on Facebook like old-fashioned people, Ile Vaino says.
The charge was to hold Erkk Pölli as a multi-stakeholder, who became a wonderful supplier.
He remembers that Pöll was considered a man who had fast hockeys and ugly stories.
I learned to feel like Erki when I first went to Finnlev when I was 12 years old, and started there as a stockman.
That's when we met Erki.
He was then Finnlevy's secretary and in various tasks, Ile Vaino remembers.
As I progressed as a musician, there were hundreds of occasions when Erkk Pölli was the director of the event at all the parties.
He was always competent, and as a result, he had a great deal of attention, music, and people.
When Erki challenged something, she went straight to her challenger skin.
He was a kind man and a good provider.
To many, he became well - known as the radio station Yelen, but he also wrote wonderful magazines.
I've had a lot of trouble with somebody.
He was good at talking, Vaino's body.
For the past decade, Pölli worked in addition to the supplier's work in the Fazer-levy company with Mr Kärjes.
He works as a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir.
However, there was a radio work that had its own style.
He did radio work from the 1960s, and he came to the numerous audiences in the Etrey of Ylen.
In 1998, the area was retiring.
The Finnish Hihitolitto reported that the Union's final accounts in May showed a profit of about EUR 450 000.
The association describes its economic situation as a "permanent rule", even though the economy has a "significant debt".
Executive Director Mika Kulma calls for rapid reaction and strong economic growth.
In this situation, we responded as quickly as possible to the adaptation measures.
The careful planning and management of the operation has been broken down by our entire organisation, which is told in the communication.
We have also been very successful in the partnership market, and in addition, the production of world Cups has been at the top of the competition.
However, the management of costs must also continue to be careful, and we must continue to seek new forms of funding.
I heard my wife crying for help, but then there was silence.
Ten bodies lie in the back of the hospital, in the city of Please, on the island of the Indonesian island of Sulawes.
Only one building separates the areas for which life has been cut down for the assessment of the need for vaccines and treatment.
Patients are also treated outside for follow-up.
One of the nurses in the hospital area was 52-year-old Bahhardd, who was looking for her son.
In many Indonesian ways, he uses just the same name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
I spoke to him last time he was going to school, Bahhardd told the news agency to the AFP.
In the area of the army hospital in Palus, Dr. Dwi Hares, who has been given the vaccines in his face and his armpit.
At first, he was with his wife and daughter at the local hotel.
The family had been invited to the House of Lords.
I must have gone to the bathroom under the wall.
I heard my wife crying for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my kids.
I hope they're safe, Haris told the news agency to the AP according to the British media.
Small goods are stolen
Please, 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, tried to calm down her daughter.
He described the tunnels in the city as hives.
The clean water is cool.
Small shops are being stolen everywhere, Kusuma told me.
Many of the residents of Please have slept outside or in temporary bathrooms.
Even if the home was thus possible, possible consequences could eventually destroy it and bury its inhabitants on its own.
According to the news agency AP, more than half of the prisoners who were imprisoned in Please were beaten after the prison walls collapsed.
Of course, the prisoners were about 560, so there are probably about 300.
Also, part of the Dodhrian prison has been wounded, says The Jakarta Post.
According to the letter, the prisoners rebelled and were thrown into prison after the guards had forbidden them to search for the people who had suffered from earthquakes and tsunamis.
Please, the airport has been reopened for most of the aid flights.
In the first group, military vehicles C-130 were installed on the field, which provided assistance.
Commercial flights Please only be allowed to the countryside.
The pilots have to land on the ground without aid because my flight schedule has been damaged by bad weather.
Sade cleans the night over Finland
The entire earth spread across the sun against the other night from the west towards a long seed area, says the Air Agency.
The seed will become the largest water, but in the Central and Northern Hemisphere it is expected to swim or swim.
The previous night's packs are not coming back because the temperatures below the ceiling remain higher.
Better night keeps the lower temperatures in good time in the wrong direction.
In the west you can walk for a moment on the side of the package, said daily meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the seed area will be reduced to a day-to-day average.
In the east and in the west, it's hot or semi-trailers.
In the evening the temperatures are always moving up to the Oulu height up to 10-13 degrees.
The beginning of the week seems to be the same for temperatures in the south and central regions of the country, but the sea is becoming more unstable.
The maritime areas have the power to provide air and sub-lock warnings.
In the near future, foreign separatists are not expected, but there is a typical seismic variation in the law.
Yeah, well, it's hot now, it's really real, Ilkka said.
Miss Suomi's finals don't see on TV.
From the IL TV you'll be able to follow Miss Suomi's competition with a red-hat glamorous and scarf.
At IL-TV, the night's winter workers are taking a direct message from Miss Suomi's red table at Billnäs' table.
It's about 18.50.
The new Miss Finland is being robbed of the ten finalists' team tonight.
Ms. Suomi's 2018 final is being held in Billnäs's dining room in Raasepor.
Before the end of the final, you will be able to follow the clock on the site in the IL-TV live post.
Live delivery starts at 18.30 p.m. and goes on for about an hour.
This year, the finals have been called especially for many of Miss Suomi's supporters.
They are represented in the Court of Justice in 1998 by Miss Suomi Jonna Ziprus.
Other representatives of the Court are Jutta Gustavsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, CEO Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and former journalist Katja Lintunen.
We were hoping that he would get to the university before leaving for Missiles.
The Russian father of Dimitri and the English mother of Svetlana believed her daughter to succeed in Miss Suomi's finals.
The young Miss Suomen Alina Voronkov's parents, Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, followed their daughter’s first steps to the crown.
They went to the public in Pertuland, and they were going to go back home after the final.
It's a nice tunnel!
We believed Erika all the time, but about half an hour before she came home, she started to cry, Svetlana narah.
Svetlana is English and Dimitri is Russian.
Alina also speaks Russian, although she has lived all her childhood in Finland.
Svetlana says that Alina was less interested in showing and many other things than my hair.
Alina was often told that when she's so pretty, she's supposed to start out of nowhere.
But he said he wanted to become a radio driver.
Before long, Alina was excited about the beauty contest.
The hope of the parents was that Alina would get to the university before she would participate in Miss Suomi's competition.
That's what I did, and finally, Alina wanted to do a Canadian study before she passed out.
We've been asking her why she wasn't involved last year, but she wanted to make it ready for her.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because she is a healthy example for young and old alike.
He's having a lot of fun and eating healthy.
And Alina likes to be in the front, it looks.
Alina's boyfriend, Jonas Hurri, is working in Japan, and you have not been able to encourage Finland to love in the finals.
Alina's parents believe the relationship of young people lasts a year.
Yes, that's what it means!
The parents wanted your daughter to go soon.
Now it's been so long for the visitors because of the misbehavior.
It's already bad, even if there's a message.
A young man died over there in Lahde. Police arrested three people.
According to the police, three persons have been arrested because of the incident.
The police have not commented on the course of the events, nor is it possible for the investigation to lead to the centrality of the investigation.
The police also did not comment on whether the arrested and the dead man were aware of their other existence.
Further information on the case shall be available first in the first week of the week.
Sari Piippo left his urine in Brussels and went home in Finland - I liked the idea of a series of pictures: there was no delay in the absence of the railway station
In the past, my husband had a lack of a solution, which he proposed to develop as a person in my history, told an Espoo series blogger, host and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo tells us that he has been an EU translator of economic and legal affairs in Brussels until ten years after the fourth child became a refugee.
I've been home late for real.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it was thought of what the father would do when the little child began to grow up.
Then the 2014 picture came to be a series of pictures.
Piippo tells us that he had never dreamed of making a series of pictures, even though he had read about Ak Ankkaa, Tintti and Asterix for a while.
I was the last to be a child, but when these creative works began to be born, the situation changed.
At first, I made a few ten signatures at the window.
My daughter Vivi Valkama (c. 2000) is probably a barrier, but I didn't get her touched by it until mid 2016 when I gave her a visa.
In fact, he endured a ten-year strike, and then he had to start trying to beat himself, to beat Pipepo, who tells him that he was a great encouragement.
It's easy to think about it, and it's a tool to try to get something early.
I didn't even try to limit the paper, tell Pippo about the relationship he usually has with him at night.
Handwriting continues to appeal to the mind, but usually I don't do it once.
One third of the strands are going to be even more than an hour.
I can do the rough once and I like to play with the colors.
It's always difficult to start crossing, because it's not my fault.
Sari Piippo tells about his valuable novels, including Scott Adams Dilberti.
The L-theme of the animal host has been inspired by a mother who has a salacial head.
The other people are Men, Piss and Twos.
In a more creative world, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from their own life and social media.
Sari Piippo does not want to preach or offer a bribe even if it is between the Lord and the Lord's Day.
Pippo tells her story to her husband and to her children.
It's such a great feeling when you look at her painting and realize that I've done this today.
And the challenges are enough for the families!
The series can be read on the web at the address of the website of the website.sympatheticbloggi.com
Lotto's million dollars left behind. These were the right numbers.
No full amounts were found in Lotto at the 39/2018 round.

The first week in Lotto's power is EUR 3.6 million.
Two of the five Jokers were found with six right results.
Another 20 000 Euro win will travel to Vantale S-Market in Tikkuril with a live winning card.

The Indonesian landscape: The air captain killed himself - didn't leave a cold storm before hundreds of passengers got safe
In Indonesia, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung has grown to be the winner of the Indonesian earthquake.
Agung remained alone in the airport until hundreds of people arrived on the road safely traveling from the island to the seaport.
The young man was at the airport of Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie, located in the city of Palun, when the landing took place on Friday.
On the other side of the airport, Agung refused to leave his place before he was able to direct Batik Air to the airport.
So he was able to save hundreds of people, and the Indonesian Air Force told the AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport after landing last night.
The flight attendant was waiting for him. He was in a hurry.
In the end, Agung tried to save himself by tapping the tower on the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken, and he had serious internal problems.
Agung was admitted to a nearby hospital.
He was about to drive on a helicopter to a better equipped facility, but he lost 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, and the airman told The Jakarta Post.
The sequence continued to save the aircraft and was finally measured by 7.5 magnitudes.
She lost at least 832 people in her life.
The Indonesian Air Administration has respected Agung's reputation in the social media.
Rehn pointed out that Europe's conclusion to trade is: "We must look at the next tweet."
The trade route between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy.
In all Europe, growth rates have been calculated and Finland’s Bank has also gradually reduced its own economic growth estimates.
President Olli Rehn said at Ylen's meeting that while there is no real impact on European trading venues, it weakens confidence, which, in turn, refers to company investment decisions.
The situation also concerns the export of Finnish companies.
I think that Europe is a very broad one.
It has been able to build an interface with the United States and to share the peace situation with China and Japan.
Europe does not think that Rehn seems to have fallen to the feet of the trading army.
You have to look at the next tweet and evaluate it after that.
We have an unexpected time with my partner in Washington, but he said in the interview.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of these is the third largest national economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and throughout the Western world.
Last night, the markets reacted extremely strongly to the clear presentation of the Italian government's Thursday morning to the underprivileged budget.
In the first year, more than 2.4 per cent of the population is needed.
Rehn thinks the situation in Italy is worrying.
Five per cent of the country's loans are problems loans, and there is more than ten per cent of the unplanned loans.
In addition, the public economy is in weak conditions and the country again seems to be more committed to the relationship of its European partners.
It may not be possible to support new crises yet, Rehn replied when asked if Italy will bring the new economic crisis to Europe.
The second issue facing Europe is the difference between Britain and the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be fine.
There should be much more negative effects on the difference.
Rehn started as head of the Finnish Bank in July.
Mario Dragh, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will be removed from office after nine years.
The debate with his followers has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor Erki Liikas' name has been rejected in speech.
It is not likely that if the Finnish names are involved, Rehn said and added that he is not going to comment on this longer.
HS superseded Black Papers will continue again in the first week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale.
The recommendations of the Helsing Sanomian set out in the White Paper will continue again in the beginning of the week.
Other presentations will be presented in the National Theatre on 2, 8 and 11 October.
October 23nd Black House is first visited in Tampere's theatre.
There's still some slips in the sales of the national character.
Tampere's presentation is over.
Liput my Lippu.fi.
The suppliers and photographers present at the stage of the winter are making a long list of evidence that has not previously been published in any HS instrument.
There's something else that no one's ever heard.
"I am surprised to hear from Helsinki tonight, you must report on the world on the other side and talk about a very timely health issue," says Esa Lija, one of the producers of the Black Table.
After the presentation, the public has the opportunity to meet HS suppliers and artists and to continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has organized the evenings of the life journalism for three years.
They have been most popular and often end-users.
Over 15,000 people have already been visited.
In the Black Sea, Bonnier was awarded a year's journalism.
The volunteers thanked the new way to make journalism and the desire of journalists to come close to their readers.
In May 2019 the Black House will be seen in the National Theatre in March.
The presence also visits Tampere and Turkey.
There is a variety of content in the presentation that will appear in the future.
The missing witness was found because of the "excessive experience"
The success of the Finnish police is a global phenomenon: "We are asking for training"
According to the police department, the police can use drones in the search for missing persons, for example in the crime scene investigation and in the media.
The police of the village, of course, managed to find a missing truck in the city of Kara in just a few minutes.
Rector Kimmo Himberg of the Police College called the case and mentioned, among other things, that "with the help of unbiased experience and effective education, we are also the world's top."
Drone is almost a new chapter and it's even more new in the police.
There's no statistics on the fact that the Finnish police would be a master of the use of drones.
According to Himberg, there is a strong attitude, however, that is not true.
This has been explained, for example, when Finnish police experience has been reported on international events.
There's a lot of interest in it elsewhere, Himberg says.
It would be hard for Turkish visitors to see the drone operation of the Finnish police.
We're asking for training.
It's going to spread out.
Himberg recalls that finding lost in Finland in the winter is as important as possible.
As noted, the missing ones in the Raahe case were found using the drone only in a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they're meant to learn more.
The drone is now being used in a lot of police facilities, and their use is increasing and increasing in the future.
That's what I used to say. Himberg tells me.
In addition to the search for missing police, Himberg may use drones for example in accident or crime investigation and in certain media.
For example, there is already a need to examine some area a little longer, where there may be a threat of violence.
Drone can use pre-communicating.
Karjalan Rugby grew up in the same family
Karjalan Rugby's party in Kuopios, winning the 2nd Division last night.
The Joensuls were still on the ground floor at 7-12 in Helsinki Rugby Cluble, but they found one in the other section and destroyed the morning guests 26-12.
The master of the 2 division is exactly the same as the historical growth of Karjalan Rugbyle in the 1 division.
Previously, the track has been played in one unit, but the Finnish rugby series activity had then been divided into two levels, the SM series and the multi-phase 1 division.
Serura's gonna take a seat against the line, but it's going to know for the first time that it's going to be a little bit of work.
The current need for twenty-nine players has to get raised by 25.
The 1-division also knows the growth and duration of the number of games, so it must also be in line with this.
Kotcaniem starts off in Montreal, strengthens the prime minister
The leader of Montreal Canadiens, who played at NHL, confirmed on Twitter that Finnish MP Jesper Kotkanemi is starting off in Montreal.
Montreal's super-licence in Kotkaneimen, 18, the first round number of three times in the stock market.
The attacker joined Montreal at the end of its exercise force and has presented strong points in the September exercise proceedings.
Kotkanemi was immediately successful in his first exercise on the day.
Deputy Prime Minister Julien called for a large Finnish development phase after the achievement of the results.
NHL's liner starts in the first week of the tournament against the time of Finland.
Montreal will meet with Toronto Maple Leafs.
What's a good leader?
In Finland this week, a lot of leadership has been discussed.
The president of the government, Risto Siilasmaa, told HS in his interview to write a book on Paranoid’s optimism, where he is in charge of his philosophy.
At the same time, he appreciates the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollila.
In the past, the Nokia's statements spoke of the inability of leaders to act as a group; fear and indiscriminateness, which led to the collapse of the mobile business.
The risk and continuity of the company's growth rate have fallen.
In Helsinki, a business life event was also organised in the week of Nordic Business Forum, which led to the development of Finnish business life.
In addition to Barack Obaman, Laval has decided to set up 12 business sites.
Talk about good behavior enough.
The leader's legend Gary Hamel said that a good leader should be confident to take the company to the future even when the company goes well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are spiritually most closely related to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of the World Foods Store, who is known for its widest nature, said that the director should share the message to the entire staff of the company.
And that purpose cannot be merely to make the owners successful.
Susan Cain, who wrote of the Introverts, said that the most successful leaders are researched in humble ways.
They work peacefully, quietly and consistently.
They're often introverts.
Professor Aswath Damodara of the Finance Department recalled that the characteristics of a good leader should be shared with the company's life-cycle.
At the start stage of the company, the manager must share a story on which the future of the company is based.
The growing company needs a driver who knows the numbers.
These students at the Nordic Business Forum listened to 7,500 visitors - mostly Finnish leaders.
They had a lack of information at risk.
A good leader needs a lot.
That is why driving is so often slow, even at the highest level.
There were also Siilasland and Ollila.
They were talking to each other in the middle of the street.
However, they must have reasoned that they were the right leaders of Nokia at the right time.
And their humility had not been easy to evaluate.
Sara Chafak reached a beautiful red spot directly from Los Angeles - most of the year abroad
But Sarah Chafak arrived in a beautiful black market.
In 2012 there was also a long scale in the showcase of Miss Finland.
A little bit of a pode jet.
I came back from Los Angeles.
It's been a while since I've spent most of my time there, Chafak's telling me what to do.
Chafak tells me he's going to Los Angeles.
He's done other things, including making famous pictures.
Working in the United States, he describes himself as interesting and as similar in Finland.
In fact, he says that work must be done harder than ever, because the model works are always easy to find.
It has to be tougher and aggressive, Chafak says.
Coreography Sonya Lindforss for 30 000 euros live art -palkinto Kuopios
The artist Sonya Lindfors won 30 000 euros a valuable cultural prize in Kuopios in the evening.
The Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art awarded Lindfors works in the choreography, community activity and education.
Sonya Lindfors' art is life-threatening to the environment.
His work to give others the opportunity to work and create a room for dialogue in a environment where they have already been lacking, Racha described the winner.
In addition to the Finnish Lindfors, a group of international artists were awarded awards.
The exhibition will be distributed annually on the field of live art, except for a strong artist or group.
The Danish police found a lot of operations looking for Volvon: "We can't tell you where"
The vast search of the Danish police has produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, the movement was closed in the fields of Juttin-ruma and Ison-Belt.
All land and rail transport on the island of Själlan was closed in Sweden, Germany and other Denmark.
The police are looking for Russia's black Volvo V90 registration.
The IS aimed at the daily police station in Copenhagen.
The search engine has been found.
We can't tell you where the car was found, Henrik Storm told the police report to the Night Sanomi.
According to Storm, the black Volvola is not in direct contact with the police.
He says the greatest danger is over.
The Danish Extra Bladet told the police last night about the intelligence situation.
The director of the study, Jørgen Bergen Skov, was responsible for the operation of the vatonains.
He didn't want to tell me what crime is being investigated.
However, Skov said it was a serious crime.
That was a threat to the human soul.
Three people have been found in the operation.
The police don't tell us if they've been arrested.
According to the letter, the restrictions on rail transport have been lifted.
The law enforcement also followed on Twitter.
The STT tells us, however, that the large public policy is no longer concerned, as the threat has been addressed to certain people.
The name of Macedonia has caused discrimination for decades - now the people vote on the matter in the appropriate elections
In Macedonia, which is located in the Balkans, the best proposal for a new name is to be voted on by the country.
According to the Treaty of Macedonia and the Greek Government, your name should be of the Nordic Republic.
Greece has thus prevented its efforts to rescue NATO and the EU from being a member of Macedonia.
According to the Greek name Macedonia, it belongs to the northern part of the country.
The question of national vote does not mention a new name, but it is clear whether the voter supports Macedonia's EU and NATO membership by adopting the agreement.
The vote started online at least in the central school in the capital city of Skopje.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse at the school, hoped for support for the contract.
People's vote means a change if it opens doors to Europe and NATO.
It means change, especially for young people, he said.
The name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been used in official contacts with Macedonia in 1991.
The Government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the adoption of the Agreement.
The national legal opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has also been called upon to vote in favour of the people.
In addition to the result, it is sufficient to increase the voting threshold by more than 50 per cent.
The national vote is not binding, but the victory of the Yes would allow the mandate to amend the Constitution.
In order to change the Constitution, the majority of the two-thirds of Parliament is required.
The Greek Parliament must also accept the agreement.
The vote will close at 8:00 in Finland.
Come on!
Robert Helenius was a hero of Erka Teperin
Robert Helenius met late Saturday morning at the professional training of Erka Teper's heavy line in Germany.
At 34 years of age, the Finnish took a 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, in the port of Stuttgart.
The foreign capital was the IBF’s heavy series of intercontinental processing.
Its winner may open the opportunity to take on more difficult tasks in the evenings whose economic significance is important.
Hellenius would decide in the eighth century, when he threw his sword at the neck of Teper's left hand.
Teper couldn't get up on the floor anymore.
"Nordic Nightmare" hit his opponent in the third one, when German swine started to bleed.
Hellenius and Teper were on the scene for the first time.
They had to be taken in December 2015.
And then Teper got involved in breaking up and getting rid of it.
After that, it became apparent that the German had doubled in doppelganger tests.
Helenus has taken 28 of his professional assignments and suffered two losses.
Teper has won 19 professional training in a clear way and has lost three times.

The formula of the units was re-enacted as Mercedes Lewis Hamilton won Russia's Gp and won his MM position in Ferrar Sebastian Vettelli in 50 points (306-256).
There's still five more cats.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
In the last year of Sotshi's opening ceremony, Bottas was supposed to have a seat on the Chinese side, but Mercedes ordered Botta to get over to Hamilton's end.

Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, is the president of the company.
Musk has agreed to deal with the United States authorities.
At the same time, Musk has estimated 20 million dollars to be spent on his tweets, which he would have secured for Tesla to take away the purse.
The U.S. Securities Commission SEC has charged Moscow with securities.
Musk continues to be the supply manager of Tesla, but the company must also pay EUR 20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Moscow is established in law.
Canada is fighting against time to reach a match with the U.S.
Time is threatening to end in negotiations between the United States and Canada on free trade between the United States and the United States.
The United States has set itself as the backbone of the sun, and the country's negotiations have been discussed in detail over the weekend.
Canada's main negotiator, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the United Nations at the UN General Meeting in order to concentrate fully on trade negotiations.
At President Donald Trump's request, the United States, Canada and Mexico launched negotiations about a year ago to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States entered into a contract with each other, but the agreement with Canada has not yet been born.
The United States and Mexico wish to enter into force the agreement before the presidential elections in Mexico won by Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took place in early December.
Trump has said that Canada's membership agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed the Congress that the plans to sign the agreement at the end of November were with or without Canada.
For these periods, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday so that the United States Congress will have sufficient time to assess it.

In the village of Kaakkuri, the tints burned at the railway station caused the fire alarm on the other side of the moon.
Ten nations were notified of the units of the rescue facility as a result of a possible emergency call.
On the spot, it was found that the linens returned to the courtyard of the railway station had been shown to the opposite room from the fireplace, so the matter had been notified to the emergency center.
There was no fuel in the area.

The draft resolution called for the creation of its SE era in the world, also for the final
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Pöytäkiv have advanced to the finals on the day of the World Cup 3/7 competition in the Netherlands.
Kisat's gonna be in Eindhoven for a little while.
The HSS Pöttakik (HSS) claimed that Finland was 50 metres from the ground where it was the second time of the beginning of 22.82.

Students show a rare brain: even the ancient tragedy - feared Oresteia affects vision
The ancient tragedies are rare in Finnish sights.
For example, the National Theatre has recently seen an ancient tragedy, Sofokleen Filokettes, in 1988.
Now the Theatterior College brought to the National Theatre a train from the National Theatre, the only permanent sample métology, the Aishylos Oreste.
In 2015 Lava opened!! project Theater School's exhibitions are working together with an international professional guide.
This fourth project, like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
Oreste was born in April of his first year in Berlin.
The agreement of the Russian Federation to strengthen the report on the completion of the Atheus massacre and the establishment of the state of justice for a period of twelve minutes, especially by clarifying the total share.
The work succeeds in being very faithful to the wonderful spirit of Kirsty Simonsur (2003).
The dramatic lights and the theater’s pages of presentation highlight the simplicity and beautiful imagery.
In the centre of this section, there is a dynamic gap between the representations of the red, nominee, and the distance between the city.
In the introduction, both two-and-a-thirds of the digits are used.
The exhibitors have never been removed from the scene, so, for example, the killings of Agamemnon and this war area of Kassandra, as was the case in the anti-examination tradition, are shown.
The statement of support is not to be emphasised on the anti-examination tradition.
Rather, a modern, faithful translation of the text is created in front of the eyes of the viewer, which is constantly aware of ritualistic practices.
The herd has succeeded in becoming a solid group of master-level sampling teams, made up of one organism, representing a group of different species.
In particular, in the raw parts, very expressive, well-promoted group formation systems, exhibitors are able to access their rights on the back, only by using the white outer surface, by displaying them.
That's impressive.
Oreste's presentation goes on in Kouvola and Oulu's Theatre.
The Korean manufacturer prepares his first water pump
The news begins to appear in Europe, in particular because of the cooperation agreement with the Swedish H2 Energy.
According to the cooperation agreement published by Hannover IAA, Hyundai provides a thousand new models of the car to the health insurance company and its partners.
In that market, Hyundai will continue to use the fuel fuel car as well as the ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models by referring to the road as the manufacturer of hydrogen vehicles.
This quality of the world's first project will continue to bring fuel technology into the process.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market area of these vehicles, for example, by following the development of the tank network, Hyundai Motor's financial manager In Cheol Lee said in the public policy of the contract.
Several times, the yurts were in the Kajana.
A little over three-thirds of the man was injured in three men in a restaurant in central Kakaan and represented it in the morning.
The man first shot one man in the restaurant, and as a result he was removed from the place.
Out there he would beat another man to the ground, and in the absence of a third man, he was still caught by the evil master.
The police arrested the suspect.
A man in the police station continued to behave aggressively and beat the other police on his feet.
The man also threatened the police with torture and murder.
The man was taken to calm down.
The case shall be investigated as a threefold offense and as an official's violent response.
At the center of the camp, another tragedy occurred during the morning.
A victim's worst suspect of two men.
About 20 years ago, a cylanist shot a victim.
A little later, another man killed him on the ground, and a man who had earlier beaten his victim.
The outsiders were dragged by criminals away from the victim, and the police were called to the place.
However, the authors had to leave before the police arrived.
The police request the event for viewers to contact Kayan police by telephone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail survey.kainu@polisis.fi.
Long line radio generator Erkki Pölli is dead
Erkki Pölli, known as a long-term supplier, died at the age of 83.
Radio designer Erkki Pöll, 83, is dead.
He went to a payoff that he told on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yes, it's gone now.
Even the doctor has said it, the day of life once again, he commented on the situation for the night months ago.
The safety of trade unions and trade unions must be ensured.
I first received a paper in 1984.
When some of these years have come to an end, it is usually about the same news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the safety of the retail trade workers, I was shocked and even angry for a moment.
I also talked about the case of the Service Committee (PAM) employer Erica Käärä.
He says the criminals don't tell the real situation.
The problem is growing, even though the employers of course claim to be different.
The police know that only cases that have been clearly tested are serious, and many of the right violence remains unreported.
"Companys have an obligation to statistics close to their status on the basis of their working security, but these statistics remain internal and their data cannot be collected anywhere," he said.
The ghosts don't go to statistics.
In the case of small arms, the problem has always been that they do not always cause physical injuries.
Psychiatric traumas can be much more serious than the muscles and wounds.
Between the different violence and the threat of violence, it is difficult to detect when a certain level of aggressive threat must also be calculated as violent - even if it is not acceptable to use it.
Too many people are afraid of their jobs, even if they don't have any real things to do.
Some of the residents are unsolicited.
The deal's got guards.
With the release of the doors of the doors, the media also showed a great shift of time from its effects to the safety of the sellers.
"Then in time, many workers organized security services for at least one night's hours to prevent work alone," Käärä comments.
When nothing happens, we're going to make the wrong decision.
This would seem to have an effect now, but this results in a new negative trend.
When conditions of disturbance were very severe due to the warning, it was thought that the warning would be unnecessary.
Now, in many places, we're trying to find solutions that could remove expensive security services.
It is very understandable that the sellers in your case do not want to make a request for an investigation of a criminal who is usually in the hands of the sellers.
However, according to the 2011 law, the fine shall be subject to the defendant if it occurs at the workplace.
I think I'm going to need some pre-conventions now.
When the next time a trader or his dad gets arrested, the police should investigate and accuse the prosecutor.
When justice was taken into the prison by a few criminals, and it was judged by the harshness of the criminal proceedings, they would be rewarded.
A society in which food trade is to be open to the small community at least once a day must ensure the safety of trade workers.
Heidi Sohlberg called on the Miss before the start of the real mission, "Sara, Iiro is then married."
Miss Crowds this year don't see the traditional way on TV, but the message looks like Viafree page.
The letter was sent by former Miss Suomi Heidi Sohlberg and the father of Viastin and Viaplayn NHL and KHL studies by Iiro Harjula.
Backstagen and a red-eyed man, Janni Hussi works.
Before sending directly, a keynote told the local authorities and the media about the costs of the shipment.
At first Sohlberg asked the public to give Harjulla a limited number of apples.
Now all the women are smart!
Now, look at this, our husband, Sohlberg failed his colleague in public esteem.
For years, Miss Suomi has been following a lot more topical.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi were sitting next to each other, and Sohlberg was hit by a small piece of shit in the direction.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg would lie down and look at Sarah.
What is more likely, Sohlberg referred to the rather isolated Sieppi, who made a comment, even though it appeared to be a surprise.
Sieppe spoke for the first time in the weekly newspaper of the Night-Sanomi.
Missignot said he didn't want to open up a difference in public, because it's a matter between him and Roope Salming.
He said he didn't have a rush to a new relationship, but he was going to focus on himself.
I focus on my own affairs, and especially on my own life, Sara Sieppi told me.
Harjula’s marriage union was still under way in later times when Sohlberg started calling Janni Hussia and Iiro Harjula as a couple.
He's been laughing at me.
Irohan was married or how did it go?
Janni Hussi's gone.
The Northern Hemisphere was attached to a married couple by pulling, burning and swallowing a strong box
The fundamental right of appeal has been sentenced to 34 years in Kokkola to three years in prison for the crimes committed by a man in his marriage.
Among other things, the crime was the fever, the headaches, and the seizures.
The Court of Justice has ruled that the State has failed to do so.
The blame for France's suspicion of a lot of pregnancy.
However, the right to vote on this case was denied.
For the sake of cocaine use, there were four cases of abuse, of ill-treatment, of rape, of the law, of the free movement, of the free movement of persons, and of two cases of rape.
Crimes took place between 26 March and 24 May.
Finally, the man was arrested and imprisoned a few days later.
On Thursday of the last week, the Court of Justice of the north gave its judgment and sentenced him to 34 years to remain in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of pregnancy
At 34 years of age, two sets of exemptions were also charged, and a number of cases were reported on 22 May.
However, these charges of justice refused to be inexhaustible.
The case was dealt with behind closed doors in court.
However, the Court of Justice gave judgments to the public.
According to the Court of Justice, the defendant had been subjected to violence, threats and forced labor in situations where this had been linked.
The blame was on the victim’s wounds with a fever, the smoke of smoking, the burning of a powerful cataclysm, and the loss of water and the coffee on it.
In that case, the right to a state has been appointed to be a crime weapon, such as a sword and a sword, a spear, a sword, a sword, a sword, and a sword.
Four witnesses
According to the Court of Justice, the parties continued to work together.
It is estimated that most of the most serious crimes took place at the end of the period of crime.
Four witnesses, two women, and two men were heard in court.
For the 34-year-old victims, compensation will be paid for stress, anxiety, suffering and temporary hardship totalling EUR 5800.
He must have the money, because the judge has the old debt in his family.
Prison sanctions are not man's first.
The night is not to say the name of the victim in order to protect the identity of the victim.
The small court of appeal is not able to write this.

The Filipino hunters fly on a drone car - thus avoiding traffic accidents
Mendiola is a Filipino poet, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He now belongs to a growing group of people in the world who steals from their own flying car or at least his own version of it.
As a competitor, he has, for example, such factors as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in mass production.
According to reports from around the world, man has used much of his property to build his dream.
He started flying six years ago to develop his car.
Now he's calling the development version a drone car.
Later on, he says he's done his first successful test flight - he's stuck on his device at a height of more than seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic accidents.
I hope the device will raise positive reactions.
It was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said according to British Daily Mail.
JHL predicts: Tomorrow's starting work activities will be seen in children's day care and social and health services
In the public and well-being areas of the world tomorrow, the exchanges of work and youth are particularly visible in social and health services, as well as in day care for children, the chairman of the JHL, Mr Païvi Niemi-Laine, assessed.
The effects will be widespread, and they will certainly appear in a way that does not fit the staff in place.
Everyone needs to think about how to get their child.
The employer now has to be careful that services are played and that no one is in danger, Niemi-Laine tells the STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, there was also a shortage of workers at the beginning of the year when the members of the JHL were in the surplus and annual exchange of contracts.
Workers have made it possible through flexibility that the staff have not been paid, but the workers have been left over or changed.
This is not a job interview yet.
There is a very normal standard for each employee to be taken into account for regular working hours and only for them.
JHL is responsible for the operation of government plans to facilitate the development of small businesses.
The labour market leader Markku Jalonen does not intend to assess the impact of excessive labour and cross-border exchanges.
However, he does not believe that they are very impressive, even if the services may be weak.
Workers around Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations for what is to be done.
The area is so wide, social and health services and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The effects can vary greatly by industry, region and employer, Jalonen told the STT.
Jalonen says that in the past week, experiences have already been experienced, including the close and basic management of the Superintendent and the Social and Health Agency of Tehy, which is responsible for three days of ongoing work.
Their effects were short-lived.
The JHL's directive on the exchange of work and annual work includes citizens, the church, the state and the private social and health sector workers.
For example, family caregivers are limited to outsiders.
At this stage, almost 100,000 members of the JHL are involved.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's actions may last a long time.
The association has also been prepared for other work-related activities if the preparation continues.
The government should now admit that this is a wall and heavy.
I'm thinking of both the ay movement and the government must come against it.
This is especially true that the bones are already hidden, even though the presentation has not been given yet, Jalonen's diary.
Great Coralism is born in the strength of children and adults - in the context of the exhibition, learning about the causes of hunger and maritime violence
In the second room, a collection of the Great Coralry was first held in Hamphur and last evening it was presented in Finland, this time in Cannelt.
In the way of the larger works of the Group, the Great Coralition is a work that is built from the beginning to the end with the public.
This time, however, a clear-cut presentation will also be built, which will clarify and reverse the findings made in the exercises.
The theaters also have plenty of soap operas for children.
The child’s view has already been taken into account at the manufacturing stage.
Nevertheless, the great Coralirism is not a childish initiative, but a presentation that adults and children work together.
It gives adults information and insights about children’s custom to take information against and make art.
The ability of children to lose their ability to practice and play together also enhances the gap between adults and children.
The great Corallery also reminds us of some of the satellite, coastal and natural information, but ultimately it is written in other, non-human conditions around visits.
The Great Coralry begins to learn about coral and coral reefs and the movements of living creatures and fish.
In six different coastal areas, including the islands of the sea and seabed, they are taught.
Finally, an hour-long measuring presentation is required in which music, the lights, and the delightful landscapes and trees will help you to learn how to live in a coral reef.
There are people in the great Coralry, and there are people who observe the life of coral reefs and coral reefs that are being examined.
In addition, there are coral reefs that check out life.
Many of the tests and findings that are directed at make the presentation more difficult and more difficult to live.
There will be a country of life, a country that examines life, and a life that examines life, or a country - and all of this at the same time.
It doesn't make any difference to children.
In other rooms, the group is striving to exercise at the level of thought and action which has been achieved when the group is composed of children and adults.
On the other hand, the participation of children makes it more important.
After the employee's work, Sitratary arranges a silent opinion for dangerous corals.
There is no need to be ashamed of the damage that goes beyond human understanding, even though it may be difficult to see the importance of exercising self - control in the face of disasters.
In other places, they have built their work in order to respect the diversity of life as well as their political status.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of information, other boys and their future generations, whose entertainment and sports are limited.
Children grow up too fast - I'm happy that my childhood wasn't smart.
Today's kids and young people are more responsible than ever.
Young people start smoking and smoking all the time, younger and younger.
I think children should be children all the time of their childhood, and don't fight for their lives because of doubts and sex, because others say they do so.
I was shocked when my friend told me that she had to ask for a fifth grade in her midweek "boy blood" trust.
When she came to ask her sister for a drink, she told me about her sex experiences that night.
I can't imagine my sister in the same situation, because we've been told and warned all our childhoods that it's not to be touched, and that sex is a matter of adults.
I hope that today’s children will be able to live a healthy life, and they will not have to grow up because of the pressure of a group of former friends.
I see more and more younger girls dressed in their clothes and revealing clothes on their heads.
Snapchatt is used to take and send images that appear at night.
It's harder for girls to think what age they are.
Today's 13-year-olds can easily appear from 18-year-olds and even parents.
My childhood was about playing in the woods and playing games.
I'm glad my childhood wasn't a brainphone.
I've been a child for many years, and I didn't need to think about what others think of me.
More: The authorities have told the state authorities that the case does not link to national security
According to Irka Kanerva, the defence police and defence forces went to inform the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committee earlier this week.
The Finnish Head of State has been informed that the study of Ariston Helme is not currently linked to national security, but to organized crime, Yle reports.
Ilkka Kanerva, President of the Committee on Defence, confirmed the information of the sources of unlisted evidence.
According to Kanerva, the defence forces and the defence police went to the Committee on Defence and Foreign Affairs this week to conduct an ongoing investigation.
This is considered primarily economic crime.
They were particularly impressed that they were not speculative that there would be something else here, Mr Kanerva's comment on Ylen's challenge.
According to the above, there has been no evidence of the material nature of the safeguards that has been found so far in connection with national security, but the investigation is contrary to the areas.
We can't know anything else about what's going on there, one of Ylen's challenged facts.
A week later, large households in the island of Turun and Mantera have raised the question of whether there is only economic uncertainty or the threat of internal security in Finland.
Yesterday night, a case was made this week, where the charges were made both on behalf of and against.
Video: The dream was saved by Liverpool’s losing row
Liverpool's percentage of Valioliika's initiative came to a conclusion, but it was still more satisfactory to group 1-1-tazal at Stamford Bridge.
It's going to be a year and a year when Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and you went to the 1-0 street street.
And then the Pep Guardiola compound sent the entire Valioliga signal that City was now real.
Everyone remembers how the last time it ended.
And certainly Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp arrived at the same ideal in West London.
The Reds had started with the six final victory of the Valiolig.
Liverpool became stronger and, in particular, Virgil van Dijk felt that he could manage himself on his own.
Chelsealla had a great weekend visit to the skipper from Anfield Road.
Then Eden Hazard rose from the alternative point of view to decide a course of action with a wonderful individual direction.
Now, of course, Hazard was right from the beginning.
In 25 minutes, he first played with Matthew Kovacic and Jorgin.
Finally, the Croatians saw Hazard go ahead and sent him a full-pressed crossing.
Hazard thought a little bit about the punishment area, but the bombed down there a perfect left side of the road to the back of the ship.
Alisson was a little slow in his fight and didn't get as much as he wanted.
Klopp must have felt that his death was a little unfair, since shortly after Antonio Rüdiger broke Mo Salah's instructions from the map.
On the other hand, Chelsea Vesser Kepa came to the truth.
The Baskevacht responded quickly to the Zadio Mané veto and your work on the floor of the tower.
On the other hand, on the other hand, Alison was killed by the fire at the time of his disappearance through Hazard.
The best place for the four came at 72 minutes when James Milner found the center of Bobby Firminon.
However, the weight of Brassitah was set at David Luisa, who saved the patriarchal position.
Neither did it last 89 minutes when the replacement Daniel Sturridge went free to shoot 25 meters.
Sturridge played his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it in honor of being unreceptive.
Liverpool's hundreds of percent-increasing formation came to a decision on level 1-1, but it's still in the pipeline, together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also closely involved in the master's armory two points behind her legs.
In the climate change debate, the potentials are deep.
I remember when a newspaper of some ten years ago asked various Finnish actors what they were sharing with the people of Finland.
Juice Leskis' answer remained the only thought: these heads.
Some of them have their heads and some they don't.
There's only one thing that can be done. There was one offer.
Finland has been in the EU during the period when the annual transfer of customs duties was granted.
Many feel the same about two times a year that migration has caused a lot of problems in the wild and has caused many problems.
Finally, this achievement is at least the easiest step in the solution in Finland, although it has been easy.
It is now difficult to decide what time will end at the end of the clock: the present summer or winter or some other period of time.
This will also allow the people to say their opinion on the website.fi.
The question has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, and it is open to the spring of 12 October.
The discussion is conducted quickly in coffee and social media, and everyone has a say in his speech.
Day-to-day advocates base their position on the morning influence on the well-being of people and on the day-to-day impact on the public's external voice and through it's well-being.
Both sides have their advocates and good reason.
Studies also suggest that morning hours should be spent on a person’s day and give him an office.
On the other hand, if it is not particularly painful to wake up in the dark, increase freedom of movement of people outside and give better opportunities for, for example, to hot spots.
The amount of an additional amount after normal working day has already been calculated for an hour.
I'd like to take both of them, but it's bad for us to be in the north corner of the planet. We can't do anything.
The roofs are too dark and are too light in every case.
The discussion on the typical subject is that it is very closely opposed to its own view and the other view.
The arguments of the opposing party are not really heard, because what matters most is what they feel about themselves.
Since almost everything has an opinion on the matter, it is a shame for someone to try to turn the other head.
That's where we're going back to the trash.
The issue is a matter of horror, because it does not require great tension and, for reasons, sufficient mutual awareness.
Similar types of issues are generally discussed more closely and unproductively.
I'm sorry if the wrong option becomes a complaint, but I don't agree with it.
And it always offers the right kind of sin if life feels at the root.
Josba fought for a neighbor's party.
Josban's first visitor to the Saliband in Divary produced complete three rows against Nurmon Yyya.
Josba went from Wall Street to home with 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) winning.
Nurmo was still running on the ground for the third time, but Josba sought compositions and turned men into chains.
In the year 50.47, the brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi built a 6-5 volume board.
During the cold season of both groups, decisive minutes were played in the field of balance.
Josban was most effective in juso Latvia (2+1).
The double box was powerful even when Teemu Tuhannen (1+1), Jere Karatin (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also arrived.
Mika Kosonen (1+0) also played his country at the time of birth.
Josballa has six points after three rounds.
Next comes O2-Jyväskki two weeks later.
I'm going to church every Sunday for 200 years.
At the end of the church, 200-year-olds will be released tomorrow morning in a very busy hour.
A week later, the church was destroyed by a riot.
At the end of the church, they were warned of a fire after two nights.
Despite the pain today, it's still a place of feast.
Although no one would like to do so, the Eno Church is now the oldest church of the Joensun Congregation.
In the middle of the church, the cold has always been the heart of Eno despite all the world's civil and other allies.
The family is starting at the Eno church today at 10 a.m.
Then we move to the circuit office on the edge of a military bridge.
The programme has a long day of all sorts inside and outside.
For example, the church building can be known as the rest of the church, which has served for 37 years as a circuit overseer in Ari Räässe.
The birth of the Church also means the end of one period.
Already removed from use, the Kingdom Hall built in 1982 has opened its doors for the last time today.
Now we're in a small office in the former office of honor, Captain Markku Koistinen says.
The congregation was devastated by internal problems, but the church has stood healthy in place for 200 years.
Elon Musk claims to be the head of the Tesla government's speech - Petos charges were agreed at $40 million
The manufacturer of Tesla and the CEO of the company Elon Musk have agreed with the U.S. Securities Markets Authority SEC.
The SEC doubted the claims made by Muski, and Musk was in danger of being founded by his own company.
However, Musk can continue as Tesla's delivery director.
Instead, Musk has to say that the President of the Government of Tesla has been in office for three years.
The company has to hire the president of the foreign government.
Musk also needs more control.
According to the agreement, Teslan must pay two independent leaders and continue to monitor the message of Moscow more closely.
In addition, Tesla and Musk pay at least $20 million (about EUR 17 million) for the settlement of the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent new market disturbances and the difficulties caused by Tesla's shareholders," says President Steven Peikin SEC.
The killing took place in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he could take the company out of the pocket.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding is secure.
Twivitt is currently in Teslan's department.
The SEC doubted the claim made by Muski.
According to the Office, it was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with other directors or potential donors.
In practice, the agency accused Moscow of neglecting investors.
The SEC informed the company and Muskete as a result of its complaint on Friday.
SEC told its demands that Musk will be judged in the courts and that he will be banned from operating under the leadership of the tax companies.
The SEC's challenge was maintained by investors, and the Teslan part went into force in October.
More than 800 people died in Indonesia's aftermath and tsunamis
In Indonesia’s earthquake and subsequent tsunamis, the number of deaths has increased to at least 832:, according to AFP, the country’s disaster relief agency.
The number of deaths is believed to be growing, because the resolution of the destructions is central.
According to former President Josef Kallan, the final figure may rise to thousands.
The current earthquake triggered a tsunami that attacked the town of Sulawes on the island of Sulawes.
A warning was given immediately after the completion of the vaccination, but it was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all the dead in the file are at least twice as different from the rest of the universe.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the region of Dodringa, which is located close to the centre of the settlement, where the situation is still quite different.
Now many people know that they're dead.
Raw aid applications
The Indonesian army has been warned to help rescue workers find victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the disaster area today, urged the soldiers to continue their rescues day and night without delay.
One of the main destinations of rescue is a hotel located in Palu, which is believed to be between 50 and 60 people in the desert.
The head of the rescue agency, Muhammad Syaugi, told us that a favorite Roa Roa-Roa hotel was made to bury one person alive at night.
We also heard people's pleas for help, he told us.
According to the disease, there would be a rapid recovery of severe cancer in the post-circumvention and tsunami.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their loved ones.
Help me, you in Palu and the neighbor.
My friends are still in the cages, and one writer called on the Facebook group.
Number of political phone numbers per year in Britain
Many British politicians were alarmed when their contact details were publicly hidden in the application because of the lack of them.
The disturbances reached, inter alia, the telephone numbers of ministers.
This included the application of the British Conservative Party meeting in the Government.
For example, Brexits, Minister of the Environment, Food and Agriculture Michael Gove, and former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, were under stress.
A lot of citizens have received surprise calls.
As a result of the lack of confidentiality of the application, the general public was able to apply to policy profiles which were part of the Conservative Party’s annual mobile application.
The public was able to access profiles using the policy email address, which was easily available on the network.
The profile writer was able to view and modify the material recorded in the profile.
Someone was able to change for a moment Boris Johnson into a professional porn screen and a screenplay.
Michael Goven's profile was replaced by the media module of Rupert Murdochin.
The Guardian’s column described the problem by writing that the meeting application allowed the other people’s profiles to be written on these e-mail addresses.
Then the writer can check the profile profile information and even send messages in this name.
The meeting application made a public assessment of the number of every supplier, politician and participant.
The Conservative Party's informant asked for an apology.
He said that technical problems have been solved and the application is now functioning safely.
The British Data Office supported the data year.
The application was made by an Australian Crown Comms company.
The party to the opposition considers that the party to the conservative party cannot be trusted in security matters.
The Wall Suomi's public is every week a large number of Polish people who've been hiding.
Careful observers drew attention to the reactions of The Wall Suomi's university curriculum.
The Wall quickly spread the U.S. format in the world, the Finnish version of Nelos last night.
Heikki Paasos' fathership game show is described in the same studio in Poland, where other international productions of the format are done.
In the Polish study, the possibilities of painting were exceptional, since the shape was 12 meters high and required space.
During the initial period of social media, a study of the programme was presented, which was considered to be a semi-stakeholder.
On Twitter, the virus will discuss whether the students in the study will sit in the semi-scientific Finnish game of nothing to play.
The Head of Four Home Programmes Unne Sormunen explains the matter for Nights.
He tells us that the studio is close to the players, other Finnishs, foreign residents in Poland, as well as even Polish observers.
The public is made up of international drummers in Finland, as well as in other countries in the same production period The Wall.
In Finland, there are such professionals, such as said professionals, who use the pictures of different programs, to experience Sormunen.
He recalls that following the game itself is not so difficult, even if he does not understand the language in which it is played.
The red and green sides of the wall are easy to separate.
However, there are translators who care for translation work.
There are two translations that translate into simultaneous interpretation to the study guide all the time.
And then the studio director guides the audience and tells us what pass is going on there, for example, and what's going on, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation to the way David Hasselhoff was given in his domestic production.
David Hassselhoff was a few years ago with Talent in Finnish pictures with us in Finland.
He had been given a full-time simultaneous interpretation, and he knew all that was spoken in the illustrations, the sum of Sormun.
Japan's south-east-run taifuna is headed towards the capital - the authorities warn of earthquakes and floods
The authorities also warn of possible earthquakes and floods.
At least 50 people have been killed in the Taifuun Tram, but the authorities say the island’s garbage has been removed and there is no other information about the death penalty.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so severe that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK radio company, people have been evacuated to places, and electricity has been lost in over 300,000 households.
Over a thousand planes have been dropped, and the crews are in a position to stop because of the storm.
Myrskyn is expected to be near the corner of the Sparta in the time of Finland for half a day.
The capital city of Tokyo is not directly on the coast, but it also has heavy winds and sands.
It's been in Tokyo today.
According to experts, Tram is suffering from Japan until Mondays.
I'm going to get my ass in front of me.
It's been a bad start.
The sky was almost as far as the distance when the group disappeared last night at home for Vaasa Sport reading more than 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The police now have five rear deaths, and the six-wheeled points are in the box together.
None of his own advocates or two lower-ranking players have yet to do the painting.
The pressures are growing all the time, too.
Sports against the public is all you've managed at the same time when the game was almost half past.
Six games have been played, and of course there is no reason to quit.
I think we should be worried about it, because it's too weak for us to play.
Especially the second time the presentation was a terrible one, Jerno Kärki told Essin 1+2 of his actions.
It's natural for sports to win.
The group had a game below the average, so it would have made it visible.
Maybe he saw it, but these things didn't work out.
The day’s travel period continued to grow
On Sunday, Mother Pirkko Hyvreinen admires the general rate of the event in the view of the Grand Chamber.
But somehow it was thought that maybe not so many people this year, Hyvreinn will meet in the morning.
With Saturday 2017, the Traktorkynnsknö SM competition was organised, so the expectations were that the total amount could be slightly lower than the previous year.
On the other hand, however, they went; they were already heavily supported before ten, the sellers told the product’s end, the new product was sold at almost 500 doses, and in the case of cars, the Hyvrenen heard an increase.
There have been some 6000 reviews of the tour schedule. The Hiver will tell you later in the evening.
At five o’clock in the morning and in the evening, there was a particularly large amount of programs for children, which would also affect them in advance.
In addition, Hyvreinen estimated that it would take longer than ever.
The sellers also travel to Liberia each year from the remotest part of the country.
This year, the sales of tableware, paperboard, and paperboard products have reached almost one hundred.
On Sunday, Mother Pirkko Hyvreinen admired the generality of the performance of the hall.
On Saturday's boat, a hundred were blessed.
In the series of children, Teija Kivinieme's beautiful table won a general vote.
Children's play was achieved in 11 different forms.
The winner of the Christmas party, Marjatta Vepsäläinen, appeared on the March border.
7 x beautiful white - this you know a good lamp
Raise your mind to the spirit, create the right feeling for creation, and read the book without tiring.
Good lighting supports a bag.
We called together three good reasons to contribute to the light.
Innolux was granted by Tarja Jokinemi, the marketing and marketing director of Innolux.
Make Service to Your Eyes
The importance of fraud increases the number of years left behind.
In sufficient light, it can help in problems that many will face over the years when the intensity of the vision decreases and there is still much more confusion.
The need for parental authority is also growing.
A sixteen-year-old needs three times more light than a twelve-year-old.
Thus, the effects of light and light on the effects of light are already on the health of the bag.
Good light gives enough light, but it's not bad, Jokinim.
Create a beauty around you
The beautiful composition will only be achieved with the right light solutions.
At this moment, the container has a choice.
There is a Japanese style that combines beauty, scandalousness and Japaneseness.
On the other hand, the modern and retrotyyl-inspiration from the 70th century has grown to the point of descent.
It is the same as the house in the other building.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramic, paper, leather and cotton.
Show Your Personality
On the other hand, more is now being put into the house than before, and there has been a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, we want to go home to talk about it, even in the light of a story we have to tell.
People are clearly seeking Finnish and Nordic products whose origins and designers are known.
So be very design-information, Jokinemi says.
The home does not need to buy new trends, but the classics for which it has been saved for many years.
Some unintended, complex and elegant classics keep their surface in mind from year to year, Jokinemi says.
Thank you and see you.
KooKoo showed the door to the Canadian hunter after three games.
The CooCoon and the attackers, Brendan O'Donnel's roads are falling apart.
The Canadian activist played three leagues in the Oransimstitus together with no factory, KooKoo tells in his report.
O'Donnell moved to KooKoo in August with a one-year agreement that included a long period of time at the end of September.
A 26-year-old attacker played in KHL at the Kunlund Red Star River and in the KHL farm at VHL in KRS Heilongjiang.
There's no information about O'Donnel's new follow-up yet.
The player wants to show an example in rotation - the goods are going to the world in rotation, the shape changed to paper.
In addition to the current games, the game specialities of the game are also packaging materials.
The products of stone shop customers are no longer packaged for mills, but for rolling stock.
For example, the products listed in the net sale are packaged in packages from farmers.
All the packages that come to us are going to be re-use.
We can use the equipment ten times, as long as the package is in good condition that it can be used, Ville Puurla Oulun is told about the game.
As a source material, the company is mainly used in terms of vocabulary and other related rolling materials.
The shells will be avoided as long as possible.
In the near future, we have the intention of moving in the letter boxes to the conversion materials.
The move wants to be an example to others.
The conversion is not a cause of excessive difficulty, according to Puulala.
There's no big problem going around.
This will also result in economic savings when, for example, bad packages are used as new.
The conversion is naturally compatible with the functioning of the Gamer, since the new products include the games and equipment used, inter alia, for the central product selection of the movement.
Each design data acquisition: One and the same set works in each place
Classes work from one place to another than from another.
They create a good garderobin based on their multi-use experience, as it is easy to collect a variety of sites in quality classes.
The more classics used in the glass glass are the quality of the glass.
This category also belongs to the black half.
There is no fault in these semiconductors made of natural material.
The clothing can be combined with direct hair and hairstyles as well as hair, and it can be made up around it, as well as with the style of a quiet location and a bright style.
The Polish is suitable for both young and young fashioners and classic fine-looking style markets.
I've seen you trust the style.
Syksysy's trend is caused by gold and silver waxes, black Polish and third black.
Along with other classics, blue-red cotton and wine-red loafers, they form a woman’s beautiful home.
It is black in Polish by combining it with the trendy look-ins of the race: the face-to-face, the high-to-sight and the heavy-skinned.
Young and cute!
The satellite operation of Russian intelligence services has a long history
There is no reason to believe that the Russian Federation's foreign communication to the SVR or to the GRU's military information would have been released from this activity.
During the Union, the so-called DRG groups were specialised in the satellite activity.
The name will be a group of Russian-speaking dispersionist groups: the satellite and information group.
The experts operating in the western part of the Security Service of the Union of the KGB are preparing detailed plans for important satellites, says archival manager Vasili Mitro (1922-2004).
His data was published in Christopher Andrew's books at the end of the 1990s and early 2000s.
Among other things, there were emissions, telaces, large streams, oil spills, and gas pipelines.
In Germany, the KGB acquired the DRG group for the uniforms of Bundeswehr, railways, freight guards and IT providers and the premises for cover operations.
This trick was used by Russian law enforcement officials in Crimea in February 2014: they were involved in local police intelligence, based on checks for you leading to Ukraine, and separated you from the country of Crimea.
During the course of the Cold War, the satellite groups were confronted with the necessary packages for land mines, explosives, explosives, and communication tools.
Another year in 1998 in Switzerland, the KGB found its hand, which was fired by the authorities when it was sprayed on the water.
Police targeted four bicycles in the country tonight.
The police were arrested on the various sides of the North Carnival for four bicycles on Friday and Saturday night.
At 18 years of age, an accountant man spoke 1,57 promilles.
He spent half a night at the start of the Kaaanints, helping two travelers.
In the village of Küorvaranti, a car was parked four nights ago, and the only one in the car was a 19-year-old local man who spoke to the police about 1.54 promilles.
He didn't have any serious injuries in his life.
In the middle of the street, a 20-year-old foreign man spoke with an alcommeter 1,33 prom.
The police suspects these men's concerns about a high-speed licence and the driver of Polvijärve.
On Saturday morning, the local package car was transported by a 36-year-old man in the town of Ollolent and Hoikanti.
I doubt he's on a train break.
The police are asking for indications of a breach that occurred after the complaint was filed by the Turkish Railway Station.
According to the police, a man was found guilty in a parking lot, representing a life-threatening outcome.
He's got a warrant for the surveillance camera.
In the dark days after the accident, the dummies that had been put on the chest or the back of the chest were likely to be removed immediately after the accident by a dark pharmacovigilance on the road to the railway station.
One suspect was removed by the Humalistonkata in the direction of the discussion.
The passenger died being left under a line car in Portugal
On the other side, the passenger died early in the morning while the line car broke down with him.

The driver of the line car is not suspicious of the crime.
Police are investigating incidents leading to an accident.
HPK keeps risk on its way to the end of the day.
Mika Toivola, director of the Hameenlinn HPK, says that Filip Riska (meaning) has been a group of important initiatives, the play of lead and the role of necrosis.
At the beginning of the trial, Filip Riska continues to play at Hämeenlinn HPK.
The success of Riska, 33, in his role as a leader, was guaranteed.
Filip has been important to us in return, in the play, and in the defense role.
Although there is still some improvement, the young team should like to hold on to such an experienced player, HPK's sports director Mika Doivola commented on the follow-up report.
It is hoped that the risk value will rise when playing the Liigan solution games.
A key player from Pietsarare has played a long time ago in JYPs, Lukos and Sports.
It was not until after the attacker, that the air striker Oskari Lehtinin was replaced by a contract.
As a witness today on TV: The pilot was left to die twice
American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on his own experiences.
Illan's film's been made on their faces.
Everest's got her first time on Finland's TV.
In October 1996, the destroyed limmyrsky surprised the climbers at Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákur’s 2015 guide tells of the settlement scheme, which has been dealt with on the farm.
The tragedy has taken pictures and documents from earlier times.
The facts are also discussed in this case.
The world's tallest mountain is 22 years ago.
Two of them were experienced leaders of racing societies: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It's just that Hall works as Weathers' teacher.
The spirit of Weathers could be saved before Nepal's departure.
As a result of this and the air pressure, he lost his vision, and therefore the spell was to be left between.
Rob Hall went on his way and he didn't come back.
But Weathers' campaign on life and death had begun.
At Myrsky's rise, he failed and no more found him back in the army.
When a man was found, he was found in such a bad condition that he did not believe in the resurrection.
Weathers was left dead.
As a miracle trade, however, he went on foot and found others.
Unfortunately, Weathers was thought to continue to die, and once again he was left alone.
The point is, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers remained in his mind.
At some point, fellow believers too began to believe in the possibility of his assistance.
In the film, Beck Weathers will introduce Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today, 200-year-old Eno Church has been celebrating
More than 200 years ago, the church has been celebrating today.
The Church was instituted on 4 October 1818, and the entire family held the celebration of the year to the glory of the sun.
The celebrations began at Eno church at 10 a.m., after the offer was offered at the Eno Congregation Hall.
The church was full.
The family took part in 517.
Before the church, Mr. Armi Rautavour was glad that people had come to the church so much.
It's a great joy for a long time, and it gives you a powerful job, says Rautavour (in the picture).
The fire of the church has touched many, and it has not been attended at the 200th anniversary of the Eno Congregation.
The former church is now in the ruins of the Church of the Evangelical Church of the Evangelical Church.
In 1770, the wooden church was formed.
In the heat of the morning, a mob was organized, where the church was delayed and the destroyed church was recalled.
Photos and Videos: My medicine was very busy in Greece - The sea lost and the roof turned into a hole
A powerful hurricane type of symmetry took four evenings from Greece on Saturday.
I've been called Zorb.
The Greek air station has issued a red notification to the regions of Attika, Peloponnesque, John Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
In the pictures taken from the bottom, there is a strong view of coming around Greece.
On Twitter, a video shows how the buildings in the city of Kyoto have suddenly appeared in the area of Corinth for some reason.
The second video shows how the car has had to be driven by incoming water.
In the name of the southern end of the Peloponnesus, the heavy wind caused strong sea crossings.
The Finnish Athenian Great Mission guides people on Facebook pages to book their own in Greece.
The delegation shall request that the provisions and instructions of the local authorities be followed.
I've got an extramarital tumor, or my doctor, and I've got cancers, and I've even had a seizure.
According to CNN, according to a 2011 study published by a medical doctor, only once or for two years worldwide, typically due to the high temperature of the sea.
Now the speaking bear left behind the arrivals in Tunisia and Libya before she continued her journey to northern Europe.
In Greece, concern has also been caused by refugees on islands such as Lesboks.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the occupied areas are bordered by access to adequate protection.
Under Myrsky are also in the middle of the destroyed areas of rural areas in the Athenian environment.
In Greece, my doctor also took drugs in November.
I don't want to go to the sea now, you're still flying on your schedule - by the threat of Cysmyrsk on the Greek islands of Lomaliee at the best of thousands of Finnishs.
The tracks heading back and forth to the sea will also be encouraged to be careful not to cross the coast or other coastal shores.
Such instructions have been distributed to the street by 3,500 in Greece through the Eastern European Union for a Finnish weekend.
The instructions will be needed, as even the Zorbas-Myrsk, which is exposed to fear, has been predicted to be a five-week Greek island.
For example, near the island of Crete, wind speeds can rise in the forest up to 45 meters per second.
It's an increased level of hostility. It's a lot of bad luck.
All passengers from Greece who have reported their telephone numbers through the Eastern and South Finland have been warned by the travel organizers by strong winding text messages.
Still, the sun and the heat
According to Ika Ikos, the expert on the communication of the constellations has been avoided from being the best until the evening.
For example, flights have decreased and increased according to normal schedule.
We're following the situation all the time.
Security goes ahead.
I'm the media journalist Antonia Schroeder says their flight has also been on schedule.
We are constantly in touch with our staff.
At least Crete was still calm, he told me about the beginning of the night.
The roads are now the most popular in the Greek islands, including Rhodes and Crete, with 1,500 Finnish tourists at the same time.
In addition, a few hundreds of passengers are slowing down in smaller areas.
For example, the worst drought on the island of Koss has reached Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on the other side of the night, Rodoks had a view of the sun and a temperature of 27 degrees, the sun's icon.
Zorbaksen has been assessed to move to the next Turkish capital, indeed a little bit of a legend.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, for example, and have reviewed the number of Finnish flights to the Netherlands, says Schroderus.
Shirley Karvisella and Janni Hussil are completely identical to those of the Missiles - so they react to the situation.
The media person and fitness nurse Janni Hussi arrived at Miss Suomi's final in the open night.
Hussie tells me that she's got a mek from Meslewi.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found me a really great tree tonight, Hussein's smile.
Exactly the same nice nighttime was also chosen by the poet Shirley Karvinen.
Both of them also noticed the same living place, and they were in a situation of laughter.
Karvinen told the night-sanom that he had come to him in quick preparation, and he had to get on the plane.
Hussis acts as a backstage and red carpet unit, and he talks about the importance of a local sports club.
There's a slight change in the Huss in the back, because he changed on Friday from Camp to Jätkäsaren
I'm going to stay there for a second. Let's see what's going on.
It's interesting that in the new apartment there's its own office, on Hussein.
Before I changed Hussein, I was alone in Greece.
It was wonderful. I was just in a hotel for a week without leaving anywhere.
When stress hit me, I got a flux, but otherwise the rest was really successful, Hussie tells me.
The use of Shirley Karvise on the plane raised a lot of attention - collected alien tests
In 2016, Miss Suomi Shirley Karvinen told Miss Suomi's final on the red screen about the development of his own radio broadcasts and Love Island Suomi photos.
The speed has even been sufficient to ensure that Karvinen reached the finish line directly from Finnair's airport.
I was laughing and putting my hair on the machine.
This is the glamorous.
I'm going home tonight, Karvin's party.
Karvine tells her that she's wearing her nose in the middle of the living room.
His preparation also aroused the interest of fellow passengers.
I had a big game, and so on, people's eyes.
At least I was interested in the idea of others.
Karvin will fly to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he'll spend a few days together.
Karvine tells us that he enjoys being rescued as a servant of Love Island Finland.
He describes his experience as having to stop by now.
Karvine tells you to start on the spring of the program.
It's kind of serious.
These are the real feelings of people, Karvine describes the feelings of the deaf.
How did they cross the bridge?
Three perfect examples
Classic equipment is a protective equipment that acts in a different position than in a position.
The classics are often older than the age of ten, but sometimes the most modern is the individual.
A few years ago, as a result of drought and drought, superfluous measures have not been removed.
According to its name, the approaches above the pool return to a pleasant year and season.
They seem to be able to share user opinions, but they encourage the model to support trials, no - no - no - no - no.

It is then about the shape, length, length, or triangle, the shape of the tip of the skin or of the activator.
Longevity seems good both at the festival and at the archipelago.
The black supernovas fit very well into the most beautiful habitats.
They are appropriately balanced with the choice of the red, whoopy hair and the soul, including the femininity of the brain.
It's hard, but it's a sexy style of architecture to romantic taste.
A strong and low-retrohenic habitat is produced from a long copper plant, a surface layer, visible replacements, and ticampic acid.
Although there is some degree of dementia in surface areas, they are also perfectly suitable for riding the archipelago together with the t-pad, long shorts and trendy lipsticks.
It's so easy and still so nice!
Two robots start moving to Espoo
They moved to the end of the year and were taken by passengers, informing the city of Espoo.
The robotics of the Otania are working on the role of the bus simulator, as it is intended to launch your traffic on the robot bus first in the morning area.
The project develops and pilots a year-long robotic traffic and tests the technical performance of vehicles in Finland.
In the test, you'll find out how robots pass through the current cave network.
The same city offers robotics the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says transport manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time, robotics are completely automatic in other modes without special transport systems.
The safety of vehicles shall always be met by a passenger sitting on the ground.
Vehicles carried out their entire environment several times over and evaluated whether the vehicle is free of charge.
If it is not, they will explain whether a vehicle, a pumpkin or, for example, a lubricant has been detected, tells Sensible 4, the delivery director, Harri Santamala, responsible for the development of robotic transport.
The robotics run all three days of the disease every week: I did it at 13-15.30, Wednesday at 10-15 and Thursday at 10-15.
The robotics stop at six stops on the track and take passengers to bed.
The robot's brakes identify the brakes.
It is most likely that you will be able to access the Otakaar on section number 1.
The mokoma-ychothese basically disappeared from the lava in the middle of the kitchen and in the kitchen.
Mokoma-gye reports on the amazing situation on the Facebook page at Tampere's Package Room.
At Tampere's Package Room, a dramatic turn came last night when the band, based on St. Helena, disappeared from the lava to the center.
The situation got worse when the band was on its way to the last chapter of the night.
The coast of this island is dark.
The band will know about this on the Facebook page.
"Be alive!"
Sattu’s compass last night at the Package Room from the bathroom in the last bus and broke his ride.
Let's hope for a quick improvement to the metallic brothers!
The ends of the rounds are treated with caution, read on the pages.
Both fans respond to the alarmed image date where bastist-Santu makes his hat in his hands in bed.
This news has been expected, it was time for serious concern as to how bad it was.
The relief is great, the brain is getting better over time.
Tsempi and short steps to the Santu and a good ride to the other band plus the winner!
And thanks to the previous, great cake was, but the promise to continue with this strong drama's ending? Write one fan.
The police control the forest in North Carolina and Savo.
The East Finland police station conducted forest monitoring on Fridays and Saturdays with the Metsäalitus and the Finnish gas station in North Karjalas and Upper Savos, the police officers told the social media during the evenings.
The headquarters of the control was in the law and the security of the forest.
Each forest producer was subject to a review of the forest map and the state country's forestry permit.
In addition, authorisations for forested landfills were reviewed as well as the number of self-propelled weapons to be used in the canalisation.
According to the police, 112 foresters were checked during the control period, and only one forester was found to be missing the required forest authorisation.
The applicant was granted an unauthorized request for 12 days.
In addition, the police denied 133 drivers of the vehicle and two of them were suspicious of the railway agreement.
In addition, the parties dealt with five traffic jams in Germany, once again the police.
Together, it can be said that foresters are very good at the promise of forestry.
A lot of foresters were surprised to watch.
One forester said that "I've been foresting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone checked the permits".
The East Finland police station continues to monitor forestry by sex with other supervisory authorities.
I am going to Turkey to follow the Syrian quota elections.
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen (K.k.a.) is travelling to Turkey in the near future to monitor the choice of the quota stations to come to Finland.
Finland has decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugees this year.
The elections are usually held several times a year, including representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Labour and Employment and the police.
The Committee of the Regions is already in the best position to address the challenges in Turkey.
The UNHCR first elects persons in a particularly vulnerable position.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be particularly vulnerable to refugees, such as single - parent families, orphans and the sick, women and children.
More people are selected to come to Finland than there is in the quota, since the practical part remains unreachable for various reasons.
I would also like to see civil organizations operating at the border of the Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylun and Syria.
The trip also includes the national leader of the Ministry of Interior, Ilkka Salmi.
Not applicable to the increase in the quota
Finland has taken quota payments since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 packs a year.
The rate was 1,050 years for a couple of years, but the government has not yet been able to agree on its rise.
The meeting has supported the rise of the quota, but the project has finally lost its resistance.
The Prime Minister, Mr Sipilä (meaning) recently presented an increase of 15 500 to 2 000 people in the year.
This is the first visit to this government to be made by the Minister of the Interior to follow the quota elections.
Former Interior Ministers Petter Orpo (c.) and Paula Risikko (c.e.) were required to move to their new assignments before the visitors were scheduled.
Finland will receive 10 000 euro from the EU for each of the refugees in a particularly vulnerable position.
Now let's go to the polls - no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
The warman announced last night the legislative amendment to the animal protection system.
The article found that legislation originally prohibits the possession of all animals which are not specifically permitted under the laws of the ministries.
Thus, all other animals referred to in the specific Regulation are initially prohibited.
If legislation is concluded by law, it means that we are rejecting a general principle in Western democracies that the law prohibits action that threatens social security or a good way of life.
It is now in the original state of the prohibition of all activities which are not permitted by law or regulation.
The change leads to the fact that nothing new can be tried in the company, for example, and to do nothing else before the legislation or regulation has been passed.
The operation of the administration in the legislative process has generally been weak.
If we are now going to the road that is originally banned in Finland, everything that has not been allowed separately, we no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I'm not sure you didn't require an update.
But this bill does not belong to democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but to the extent possible, it adopts such a "conventional procedure which is not permitted by law or regulation" procedure.
It is hoped that there will be a wise minister who will halt the progress of such a bill.
Metti Forssell spinach: Sucksy's four trendy smile
The trend of this disease comes in the form of cancer.
It looks especially good in the teeth.
A single horn is made up of smaller peaks, such as a pole or a normal t-state pair, so that the locality remains comfortable.
This scar tissue looks rough and, in particular, it is one of the most trendy features of the season.
One of the great eyes we smile beautifully with a woman’s upper ear, or we're tired of a couple of days.
You can play with your silkhamen even more bravely and throw on your foot chains or skeletal trendy cowboy boots.
It doesn't matter whether it's a threesome, rough or multiple, all reddish teeth are now part of every woman's black sea syllables.
Together, you will be able to use a variety of colors, as well as to play with your spinal cord, in different parts of the upper part.
For example, the corrugated shell and the palm tree are beautiful.
Non-symmetric lamps are a wind relief from the coldness of the summer, which can lead to the cold.
The non-symmetrical neck is the same as the female and her play and is suitable for both her neck and her neck.
Alexia-baby, 3 Kk, slowly murder in the eye of Jeren
In the middle of the family picture, there is an intense three-month Alexia baby.
Nana Karalaht tells Keraval based on the Aito Date Code.
Traveller Nanna Karalahti, 30, and ex-graduate student Jere Karalahti, 43, were married in early July.
The first son of the Parisian Jax was two years old in May, when little Alexia is a three-month-old baby.
Nana Karalaht was recently with Martina Aitolehde in Marbella, Spain, where the entire Karalah family was involved.
Nana would publish a picture of Spain's feeling in the Instagram, where the entire Karalah family will take their place.
The children of Jax and Alexia are in their parents' eyes.
I take note of Alexia's viciously mutilated baby, who sneezes at Jere's hands.
Thank you for this.
Thank you for your kindness, for your forgiveness, for the generosity of people and for your joy, write Nana Karalaht at the home of the poet.
The Fitness journals of the Public Programme of Nana Karalaht and ex-graduate student Jere Karalaht recently went to the daily bus and opened the Aito-day home to Keravald.
In addition to Karalahti, there are food experts Johannes Laine and Hanna Liisanantti, responsible for growth.
Johanna Salvo was rewarded as director of the Day House.
In Turkey, travel calls are requested to be made for seafarers
In Greece, the clean Zorba-myrsk is expected to be transferred to Turkey on Sundays.
Meteorologists warned in particular the Western Mediterranean seamen, fishermen and farmers of Greece’s drought, writing CNN Turkey.
The Troopy Sea is told to move the coast far south during the northern day.
In the morning, disaster and emergency authorities urged citizens to download their mobile phone before the storm and ensure the operation of the Internet so that people can get timely updates, says local news agency Anadolu Ajansi.
People have been invited to stay at home and away from the windows and for example to move out of the wind.
Turkey is expected to be in a coastal zone and the wind is expected to speak 28-33 metres per second.
Green Warning in Greece
On Thursday, the Greek air services provided a red notification to the regions of South Korea Attica, Peloponnesos, Jonah Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Greece's travel agencies have warned of the Finnish Zorba drought in Greece.
The Finnish Athenian Embassy would also publish a Myrsky Warning.
Travellers were invited to follow legal procedures and instructions from local authorities.
A little while after I got in touch, there was a strong wind and it hit.
The people were very peaceful, the messenger officer Laura Aaltonen Tui told the STT last night.
Aalton described the situation as similar to that of Saturday morning.
By night, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had also not received any messages from the Finnish in distress.
In Greece, in many ports, ships did not travel by night, told local news agency Amna.
The sailboats headed for the sea were withdrawn in the evening, and travel agencies were told to the STT.
According to the Finnish Athenian delegation, temporary disturbances were expected for aviation and shipping.
In the evening, the Finnish authorities were told that they were actively following the construction project.
Kimi Räikönen went back to the cause of Mercedes's improvement compared to Ferrari
Ferrari Kimi Räikkönen was able to admit that the bad competitor Mercedes was too strong back in the time of Russia's gp.
However, there is no need for the package in Ferrari. The experienced driver assesses.
They were just faster than we were, but there's nothing great about it.
Our car was the best time for the whole weekend, but they were just too fast, four-year-old and their heavy blood with Sebastian Vettel clearly left the word ‘Mercedes’.
Ferrara had a hard time in the previous casino in Singapore.
From the border, we were asked what exactly leads to the sudden collapse of Mercedes's petition.
They seem to be moving faster than we are... so simple.
If I knew why, we'd probably go as fast as they did.
But I don't know more than anyone else.
This is always an assessment, and they seem to be us right now.
Who knows why?
In time, a rare feature was seen in the case of Sauber, the future port of the State.
Charles Leclerc, who replaced Ferrara for the first time, was the seventh person, and the last one was also killed by Marcus Ericsson.
The ten departures to Sweden are the best for more than three years.
And while in the second season, five drivers left the whole time, the result was quite severe for the Saubers.
And what about the future of the courageous nation?
Yes, if you compare them to where they were from at the beginning, then there has been a big step forward.
First year there are different stories, so let's see.
It was there - Robert Helenius's storm of Erka Teperin: "Robbe is back"
Robert Heleneus and Erka Teper's visit to Stuttgart last night, in the same brand.
The German was in a position to be more proactive, but he did not get the right skills for the party.
Clearly, Helenius controlled the exercise on his heavy shoulders, which were found to be very expensive.
The Finnish was also clearly better physically than Teper.
The race finally came to an eight-year-old, when Helenus fell to the left, directly to Teperin.
It was so hard that the concordant standing in front of the house did not even try to climb the ladder.
Helenius, when he was sure of the wind, was very mild.
In his appeal, he began to appeal to the creation of a good conscience and to his opponent.
Then he chose a moment to refuse.
Thank you for all the viewers and Finnish promoters.
We were taken for dinner tonight.
Hellenius was happy right after the funeral.
That was a great victory for the daughter of Hellenius.
Perhaps it would be possible to access even the MM, Helenus's comment to the Night before the night.
Instead, the killer could have decided the entire cycle.
Of course it's been thought of.
There's no more youth here, 34-year-old Helenus admitted before he met Teper.
The number of disasters in Indonesia can be multiplied
According to The Guardian, the vice president of the country is calling for a clear increase in the victim's life.
According to former President Joseph Kallan, the total number of victims can rise to thousands.
Poor conditions
The rescuers were looking for survivors of the disaster, as well as the victims of the evils of the island of Sulawes: from the port city and its neighboring village Dongrya.
Secondly, all the victims are from Palu, the situation of Dondrian has not been resolved yet.
Hundreds of people are missing, and about 540 have been badly injured.
In fighting buildings there are still people who have not been able to get out.
For example, Roa Roa's hotel in Palu has been created.
The rescuers are echoing the cries of the people who remain in the grave, but the lack of a weapon attack has slowed down the beginning of rescues.
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia has appointed the army to rescue and attack.
The army and its fleet are needed because in a disaster zone, electricity and computer communications are many different places.
The fuel stocks are also at risk.
Miss Suomi's inconsistencies and long-term reasons caused a narcissism
In Billnäs, the best choice is to choose a new Miss Finland.
A question was raised to each misunderstandings during the interrogation period.
The financiers raised the question of the balance of the balance sheet on the table.
Especially finalist number six Emilia Antikoske, 23, an undisputed response was in place at the time of the general, but excellent laughs.
The question raised to the anticos had come through Facebook.
The user Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what is the last book that has been read in the past.
Antikos thought he'd respond well before he started the wrongs.
Thank you for asking, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read is... Anttikoski said he was thinking.
The report was received in general during the nasal period until Antiskoski continued to reply:
The last book I've read is...
Yes, I've read books in school!
I'm sure there's something about the economic data.
So the last book I've read is that someone against you, Antikoski.
After his response, Antikoski received from the general apologetics as a stopover.
Later, under misgivings, Antikoski turned his attention to the fact that he did not want to take up arms because of his principles.
In 2018, Miss Suomi will be held at 2.00 p.m. when the last year of Miss Suomi Michaela Söderholm.

An international crime event will be held in January
In January, Ruka was the first international literary festival to be held in northern crime.
The Nordic Noir event programme consists of challenges, panel discussions and other literary instruments, as well as jazz music.
The festival's literary works include the importance of Swedish literature by Jens Lapidus and Erik Axel Sund's writer, Jerker Eriksson and Håka Axlander Sundquist.
In the context of Swedish names, the authors are also seen from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
The Finnish writers represent Max Seeck.
According to the organizers of the Festival, the northern location, nature, the dark seasons and the unique environment of Puusamo provide the basis for a unique written experience.
The status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts from the merger
What does it do to a person’s recommended, charismatic, or desirable?
The researchers who analyzed the case at the University of Sydney have proposed two small-scale "cool" boys: generally attractive college and the opposite secondary school.
Unfortunately, people in colleges had many socially desired features, according to the researchers ’ description: they were outgoing, friendly, compatible and qualified.
There was also typical distance, selfishness, captivism, and pride for others.
They ran experiences and only kept some external evaluations.
Both types combined a good sense of self and a strong sense of life.
The role of harshness is no longer cool: high status in teen years is no longer necessary to lead to success later in life.
This is how a United States research is published in the 2014 Child Development page.
In the early years of young people who followed, photographed, applied for good habits, and tried to recommend others, young people had increased the risk of using drugs and thinking of crimes.
In human relationships, they were weaker than they were in the past.
High status transmits tears of touch, marks, or bells do not make a person cool, or at least a very attractive effect.
In a study published in the Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, a majority of people were willing to develop a normal market with those who had been trapped, even though most of them chose a better brand.
If you're on Greek vacations, beware!
There's an ancient fear-in-flamming warning to sound red.
During the weekend in southern Greece, there can be as much water as in Finland for half a year.
Zorbas-Hermorysky skies during the week of Greece.
Save if you live in Peloponnesos, John's Islands, Cyclades or Crete.
Myrsky is very powerful, so the Finnish Athenian Embassy announces it on the Facebook page.
According to the great approach, the Greek aviation service has given the regions a red warning.
We will also tell about the approaching storm service in Forecan blogs.
It says that the toughest trees in the sea are up to 45 meters per second.
Because of comparison, from the beginning of Finland, Kuisma-mursky spoke more strongly than 30 feet [31 m] per second.
According to the blog, however, the greatest concern of the Zorbas-Myrsk is not the wind, but the sandy sand.
During the week, it can reach more than 300 millimetres of water in South Korea.
It's about half of Finland's annual crop.
Severe Weather Europe has shared video development on Facebook.
Zorbas-mursky has caused the arrival of Tunisia and Libya this week.
Do you recognize men who died in Love Island Finland?
It offers amazing YouTube videos
It is rare to know that in the Love Island of Finland series many men die of beauty Anku also has a wonderful video presentation published in 2010 by YouTube.
The videos Anku advises the attackers, including the preparation of an old black market paper.
The neck also looks like a sympathetic style, as it can be used to sympathize with the skin that grows in the right lengths.
Now I'm going to put the cattle to grow, but also do it in a little surprising way, Anku walks around and presents the fruit, sugarcane, and the seed of the raisin that he makes.

Captain Bottas, and your escort to the Adrenaline in Sotshi, is he supposed to be Hamilton's assistant on Sunday?
Governor Bottas was a little more than ten minutes after his departure from Russia's Gp when he was in front of the media.
The fine circle left behind Mercedes's unit, Lewis Hamilton, and was certainly a vital criticism to this long-standing Finnishman.
It's a nice ride.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the center of the settlement.
Feels good, I'm a little important yet, Bottas found out.
I've only been away this time this year in Italy (in the middle) so time has been legal.
This bike has been good for me before, and I've got a good ride back.
Sotshin's radar is not easy to close, so it's a very big role to play.
And it's true that Bottas was able to respond to his departure, whether he was winning tomorrow or is still a match for Hamilton, who is approaching MM.
The point of my departure is definitely what I'm trying to win.
There can be no other purpose in leaving the palace, Bottas abandoned it.
But we're fighting both monsters.
Lewis' leader Sebastian Vetteli's time is big and different to me, so it's got to be remembered.
Let's see what's going on, but Bottas is full of you.
After some time, Hamilton was very happy about the success of Bottas, and he enjoyed the taste of Toto Wolffield's talent.
Lewis had the intention of winning the State, but he did not succeed in the race.
The governor knows he has to renovate everything himself to defeat Lewis.
And he was so tired that the adrenaline of your bag out of your bag, Wolff failed.
If you ask him about Bottas' and Hamilton's time, Wolff's answer is clear.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the party goes.
Chinese Erno Kinnunen arrived at the Finnish masterhouse on the street
The road vehicle SM series has recently ended.
It seems that the brothers have never before decided to serve as masters in Finland.
Now they did it in the environment of the Turun and Salon, in the decision-making area of Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen, because Eerik won SM1 and Henrik SM2.
The Chineseman Erno Kinnuen made sure that his urine was the best reach when I decided to sign to him on the SM4 category of two-wheeled cars in Finland.
The contestant of Honda Civicl Ville Mäkelä started with a competition model because the starting points were clear: the investment in the group of ski resorts returned to the SM title.
In the darkness of the spring, the two had to take a step when part of the extra load was thrown into another special test.
It's got time to set up a third party.
In such a situation, it would not fit in with the gloves.
On Saturday, only on the second line I was in the rush of Jussi Tepon, the man told me.
Syria requires the United States, France and Turkey to remove their group
The Syrian Foreign Minister requires the United States, France and Turkey to take their group away from Syria.
At the UN General Meeting last night, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
I remember saying that foreign troops are fighting terrorism in Syria, and the war against terrorists is, according to him, "the end is near."
In the UK, Muallem also invited the Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
However, for seven years, the battle will not seem to end.
More than 360 000 people have died in the war.
On Friday in Germany, the Deputy Chancellor Angela Merkel said that in late July there was plans to meet Syria, which would also include the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.
Not exactly Super Bowl, but ten million Americans looked at the Supreme Court of Justice TV.
Judge Bret Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who is in charge of the Supreme Court, received a very different number of people from the Red Cross.
In the United States, at least 20 million people in the Supreme Court of Justice were on their television screens.
In the meantime, Donald Trump, who was named Kavanaugh and a Californiaian professor, Blasey Ford, were in front of the Senate Justice Committee in front of his story.
According to the initial results, six main audiences, ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC, and NBC, total of 20.4 million viewers.
In addition to their network, there were millions of more listening.
The NBC reported that the survival rate was 6.8 million people and CNN reported on the start of the year in its forecast 8.2 million.
The number of CNNs increases by more than 10 million when it is estimated that via Youtuben and Facebook, the number of CNNs is over 10 million.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million.
Digital startups are the property of channels, TV viewing lists are the last of the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen publishes final readings on the ground, but they are, in each case, most of them.
It's a rare thing to lose 20 million.
More than 20 million spectators will normally only be reached in the United States by sports teams, as well as by the great Oscar and Grammy countries, as well as similar political events, such as presidential talks and presidential elections in 2016.
In the United States' annual review programme, the U.S. football team's NFL's finalization of Super Bowlin is on its way.
This year, Super Bowl collected about 103 million people from the North American channel of NBC.
In the last year of the first talk at the convention, Nielsen, according to Nielsen, saw some 48 million people and officials more than 30 million.
It's too important.
The Supreme Court of Justice is the most important case in the United States because the authorities are alive.
Trump was already appointed as a new judge when Antonin Scale disappeared from the beginning of 2016 and the Republicans managed to prevent such President Barack Obama from naming him as his successor.
Another place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was the president of the Republical Republic, Ronald Reagan, but he was in so many issues a lawyer who could vote on the position of the nine-member Court of Justice.
He was an advocate for the rights of abortions and sexual abuses and, for example, decided in 2015 to vote that the same sexes had acquired the right to marriage in the entire federal state.
Kavanaugh is significantly more conservative than the cannon.
His choice to the highest right may include the decades of the conservative power of the right.
Children have the right to access their parents' information
Only the parents of children under 10 years of age will see their children’s health records on the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong and it's ridiculous.
Of course, the situation of the Kanta service in the early days was even more alarming: the parents did not even have access to the health data or prescriptions of small children.
The situation was provisionally adjusted by gender in 2016 for less than 10 years.
After that, the procedures have been approved for correction, but the correction has gone a long way.
Now the correction is under ban in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, the amendment of the legal framework should not have been more than preserved.
Then, with the understanding of the earth, it is about the pressure of the earth: now that the baby is held hold, it is opened.
The child may show his information to his parents if he has a bank account or an official identity card.
But how many 10-year-olds are there?
A personal card is taxable, and banking is not even available at the age of 10.
In practice, the fourth grade data of the sub-school will not be available to see anyone other than by asking for it as a result.
This is not about the rights of both parents and children.
It is of utmost importance that parents be involved in the child’s treatment.
Of course, the right of teenagers to privacy must be taken care of.
They may also have family ties that do not allow them to talk about all things freely.
They are often related to sexual health, which free care is a very important human right.
In the United States, the FBI launched a campaign to deal with the disturbances of Kavanaugh
According to the U.S. media, the FBI will identify at least two women's abuses.
One of the other women had been listening to the Senate Justice Committee this week.
Kavanaugh has challenged the charges of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
In the United States, President Donald Trump appointed the FBI to resolve the charges on the request of the Senate Justice Committee.
The explanation can't last a week longer.
According to Washington Post, this is an investigation of a more limited resolution, and it does not necessarily become public.
A man threatened to kill a cop with a police station in Kakaan.
The arrested hostages continued to pulsating even in the chambers.
The police tell the man's police officer to "scream."
The police had to pose a threat to the suspect's suspect in Kajana the other night.
The official is aware of the incident that began when a 30-year-old man was severely challenged in a central hospital.
First, the man was in trouble with the other client in the hospital.
This led to the removal of the restaurant.
Out there, the killer attacked another man by hitting him on the ground.
When the third party was in the middle of an effort, the man still shot him.
The third murder led to a police call.
The party took the man and took him to the police station, the police tell him.
The suspect continued aggressively with the police station.
A man would shoot another cop on his feet.
He threatened to kill the cops and the bad guys.
The police tell the man's passport to "scream."
The man has doubts about the three charges of evil and the violent opposition of the official.
Aid organisations are preparing to start work in Indonesian Sulawese - "The water is the fastest."
The United Nations Children's Fund and other international aid organisations are ready to assist Indonesia's Sulawes island, according to Finnish UNICEF Commissioner Kirsi Haru.
Local authorities are leading rescues, but the need for additional equipment is already apparent at this stage.
Unicef works in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
Because of normal activity, the Unicefil always has full emergency preparedness, says Haru.
The first task is now to find people from the grave, both living and dead.
In the city of Sulawes, rescue measures are under way, but in the Dondrean region, the situation is a bit more unexplained.
There are already places where contacts don't work.
The aid measures are difficult because the roads are also apart, the truth of Haru.
The buildings in Sulawes often have light structures, so the damage caused by earthquakes and tsunamis is great.
When their survivors are found, they need protection - first of all, for example, tents and clean water.
Clean water is the fastest in crisis situations.
First of all, people are often able to offer water-cleaning tablets that are also stored in the warehouse of Unicefila.
Water systems are attempting to fix as soon as possible, but in emergency cases water is transported primarily by rivers.
In crisis situations, many children are separated from their parents.
The search for family members and the integration of families is part of the task of Unicef.
Food aid also organises the World Food Programme, which is part of the UN.
In the early stages of emergency management, the funds previously collected are used.
Others, however, have already started the financial crisis to help the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami.
billionaire Elon Musk ends up as president of the government of Tesla - 20 million dollars of foreign currency
Elon Musk, founder of space structures and electric cars companies, avoids fraud under an agreement with the US Securities Commission.
billionaire Elon Musk will cease its task as President of the Tesla government and will be committed to 20 million dollars.
Musk claims to be part of the contract that he concluded with the US Securities Markets Authority.
By agreement, Musk avoids fraud.
The U.S. Securities Commission SEC threatened Moscow's securities agreement in August because of the tweets it sent.
In them Musk wrote that he was preparing an electric car company for the removal of Tesla from the porcelain, which gave the company a rapid increase in its share rate.
According to the agreement, Musk cannot act as President of the Government of Tesla for three years.
In addition, Teslan has to be appointed to his government as a new "non-agried member" and to take two "individual leaders" into his leadership group.
Teslan must also establish a committee to monitor the communication of Muski.
Musk can continue to be Tesla's delivery director.
In addition to 20 million personal bills, Tesla company may also have to pay 20 million shares to the financial controller.
Tweets leading to investors
According to the SEC, Muskin indicated that investors and Tesla’s shareholders were in charge.
Musk claimed that he would have secured the funding that Tesla would buy from the parcel back as a private equity company.
According to one billionaire, the company would have been purchased out of the stock price of $420.
After two weeks, Tesla’s share rate rose by more than ten percent a day, but later it fell.
According to the SEC, Muski's claim had no basis.
According to the supervisory board, he had not actually negotiated his claim for funding.
He has also not discussed the removal of porous levies with another group or company government.
This weekend, the rate dropped by 14 percent when SEC security officials reported fraud.
The new agreement is expected to re-establish the firm's rates.
The last judgment is not a cause.
Of course, the clocks of the production camp are not sound when the inspectors are not moving.
That's a technical message.
Helsing's court hearing has been suspended.
The visas will show the hour of the two.
The situation is like the central horror picture: even when you heard of the church’s screams and screams in their hands.
This is not a natural test, but the clock has stopped because of the technical reason: it's broken.
It's been seen by a repairer, but some of it has gone wrong and is expected to be a new part, the story of Evelyn Jamsen tells me.
At the same time, James will confirm Churchko in Helsinki - a Twitter account already mentioned.
In this respect, the Court stated that the last judgment was not a cause for the suspension of the term.
James tells me the church bells don't call for blood.
