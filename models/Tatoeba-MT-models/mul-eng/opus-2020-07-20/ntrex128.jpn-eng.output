Member of Parliament of Wells, which is a threat to shame.
The proposal to change the call of parliamentarians from AM (Assembly Member) to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament) has raised concerns among some of the parliamentarians.
The plan to change the name of the House of Wells is the beginning.
Members of all political parties are afraid that this is going to bring about a scandal.
A member of a working party has the idea that "Twp" and "Pwp" are going to break into the party.
And when you explain it to a reader outside of Wales, Twp means "twp" in the Welsh language.
Some of the MPs of the Priid Kamley Party suggested that the entire party was "not satisfied."
Wells MPs said the party was "open" to change its name, but the MWP and "muppet" were not certain of the vote.
The sound of the word "w" is like "u" in the English of Yorkshire.
Now, the committee of parliamentarians in drafting the draft amending name said: "The final decision on the vote of the House of Parliament is something that the House itself will not say."
By the law of Wells, 2017, the Welsh Parliament had the right to change its name.
In June, the Committee made it clear that there was a significant change in the name of Parliament from the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament, which opened the outcome of the civil agreement on this proposal.
With regard to the president's appeal, the co-committee supported the case of Parliamentarian Wells (Welsh Parliament Member, a WMP), but the most significant support was collected in the municipal agreement.
The House is actually proposing an alternative, but until the agreement is reached, it is possible that President Erin Jones may be the cause of the headache for the draft legislation on change in name within a few weeks.
The legislation on this reform also expands the way other reforms are made in Parliament's rules of conduct, including the structure of the parliamentary system, which includes the House's non-confidential resolutions.
In the process of the legislative debate, the House will have the final right to decide what to call itself.
Macedonia is making a national vote on a change in its name.
A vote will take place on Sunday, asking whether the country's name will be changed to the Northern Macedonian Republic.
The national vote was organised to resolve the area known as Macedonia in the country for decades with Greece.
Greece has long argued that the names of the northern states are worthy of the claim of ownership of Greece's territory, and Macedonia has strongly opposed joining the EU and NATO.
President George Ivanov, who was opposed to a change in national vote, said he was going to ignore the results of the vote.
However, supporters of national voters, including Prime Minister Zian Zaef, claim that the change in names is an example of joining the EU and NATO.
While the church in Harlem is struggling, the hour of St. Martin's church is closing.
"When you talk to an old man, you'll hear that there's always been a bar and a church in the past," says Adam.
"There is no such thing now."
There's no reason why Bar was missing.
"I'm taking communication in another way."
"The bar also disappeared from the nearby living room that was going to pass."
He is concerned about the fact that the money from the sale of property will not continue as long as the authorities expect it to be done soon after it is too late.
Furthermore, the church is replaced by an apartment and a mansion, and the people who live there do not cooperate to maintain the church.
"Most of the people who live in this building think they're white," he says, "this makes the church shut down.
The church was built by a white congregation, and then Harlem became a black town. In 1870 the Metropolitan community was founded by Saint Martin 10 years later.
It was in the 1930 ’ s that a large white mesosist congregation was formed.
The black congregation, who were praying nearby, owned the building.
Saint Martin was under priest John Howard Johnson, under the influence of the Black House, and the priest was directing a small business boycott on 125th of Harlem's shopping center, and he was helping black people to hire and support black people.
The fire caused much damage to the church in 1939, but Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild and relied on Carolion.
Professor John Howard Johnson and the successor of Professor Johnson called Carolion "the Bel of the Poor Man" in St. Martin.
In July, the actor who came to Carolion's play called it "the treasure of culture" and "the historic instrument."
According to Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, this is the first carion played by Dionysio D. Lind in the world.
Mr. Melivezer said St. Martin couldn't replace him.
In the past few months, what was done in St. Martin is a complex story of the builders, some of which were sent by religious leaders of the church, and others by the church.
In July, the clerical administration of the parish office sent a letter of appreciation to the parishes saying, "I want to pay the costs," but it was not involved in hireing the builders and the lenders.
Some of the parishioners said that there was a lack of transparency in the conduct of the clergy.
You know, California, you're going to hit Same with a 13-year-old boy who's playing the devil in Robster.
On Saturday, the authorities reported that Same was injured by a 13-year-old boy who was asleep in Robster, California, on the day that Robster was born.
A little before 7:00 a.m., it happened at the Biconbitch of Encinitas.
According to KSWB-TV, Chad Hamel, when he had friends and water in San Diego on Saturday mornings, he heard a voice from the boy asking for help and went up there.
Hamel thought he was just too excited to take Robster first, but he immediately realized that he was crying.
It's broken!"
His neck was broken, and when he rescued the boy, Hammer noticed.
"They're all crying out of the sea.
The boy was transferred to the Radi Childrens Hospital in San Diego, where he was in a dangerous situation.
I don't know what kind of snake you're trying to attack.
Larry Jails of the Lifeguard Captain met with him a few weeks ago to verify that there was a snake, but he proved that it was not a dangerous species.
Also, on the top of the young body, there's a very deep external wound.
In order to investigate and secure security, the authorities closed 48 hours from the ponttbych of Casabrad to the Sumbichi of Ecinitas.
It is said that there are more than 135 snakes in the area, but most of them are considered to be safe.
Cinnsbury's plan is a big step forward in the British beauty market.
Cinnsbury used Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams on the beautiful streets of Stiff's party style.
As a result of the decline in fashions and household goods sales, which continue to make significant progress in the United Kingdom's US market of 28 million pounds, there is an increase in the number of brands in 11 of the country's fairs, which will be tested on a larger way of beauty and, if successful, the annual market will grow.
The investment in beauty was created to model how to use all the space of the cave when the supermarkets were charged with television, electronics, and household supplies.
According to Cinsbury, the number of beautiful products is twice as high as 3,000 points. The product was first introduced to the brands of Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
I'll be able to take more places in the brand space, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline, Burt's Bees.
The store is refurbishing the bottle, leading most of the products to Vigan according to the wishes of young people.
In addition, the Flagranschop of the wine industry is divided into two Sinsbury stores, one last week in South London, and one in the late half of this year is open to the Serio Orc of Barmingam.
On-line shopping, with the tendency to buy a small amount of food in the local conbinesta, the Supermarket had to work to call customers.
According to CEO, Mike Cooper, the supermarket chain has more services to reduce food and fight Aldi and Lidl from the disk account.
Cinnsbury has increased the sale of food and has increased the power of shops in Argos since two years ago.
The previous attempt to renovate the beautiful hotel and the drug plant failed.
In the early 2000s, Seinsbury had been traveling with Boots in Benchaire, but the relationship between how to distribute the profits from the drug industry was broken down.
Seinsbury showed 281 drug dealers three years ago, Lloyds Pharmacycheen's owner, a new plan for Celesio with a sales of $2.5 million.
It's about Lloyds, and it's about La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mill Hicks, a commercial director at Cinnsbury, says: "The way you change your client's environment is to change your vision and sense of beauty.
I'm also investing in a highly trained colleague who is going to get advice.
Our brands will show a new beauty business in an attractive environment and an easy place to sell old things.
Peter Jones is "heavy" because Holly Willowby withdrew from the 11 million-pound deal.
Peter Jones, Star of Dragons Dan, was so angry that she withdrew from the 11 million-pence deal with Peter's life-style brand business that she focused on the new deal with Marks, Spencer, and ITV.
Willowby is unable to spend time with family supplies and accessory brands.
Two of them were compared to Guinness Partrow's group brand.
This morning, Willowby reported his withdrawal from business in an instaggram.
Holly Willowby left the Peter Jones of Dragons Dun's Star, to join the new big deal with Marks, Spencer, ITV.
When it was announced that it would not be possible to spend time with her family supplies and accessories, which were worth $15 million in her new contract, on Thursday's Golden Gates program, the news reported that Johns was "hot".
The business was compared to Guinness Partrow's group brand, and Wirove's estimate of 11 million assets was doubled.
When Willowby reported that he was withdrawing from Truly in an instagration, Jones flew out of England to one of the other.
"Truly is now the highest priority for Holly.
It's going to be a long period of time that we've seen these decades.
Nobody was surprised at the decision to withdraw.
No one could believe what happened on Christmas Eve. It was there.
The Moroccan company has a lot of warehouses in the goods prepared for sale."
According to experts, hundreds of millions of costs will arise as a result of the departure of Wirowby, the most expensive star in the UK, as a result of the departure of Cosson, Candola, the clothing, and the possible delay in the sale and sale of products to domestic goods.
This means the end of a long-term relationship.
Willowby and F. Baldwin, a mother of three, were married to Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, and for ten years.
Wirowby raised Cap and Truly in 2016, and in March, Jones took part.
Two of them spend the rest of the day, and Jones gives 40 percent of the entire TV companies in the Voldwin.
Willowby's gonna be M&S's board, and then it's gonna be an I'm A Celebrate instead of Ant McPartlin.
The close information with Jones said last night, "I don't comment on his business."
It's hard to say, "I fell in love."
He told Jack that the media criticism that he was supposed to be "unopened" was very interesting about North Korean leaders.
Why did President Tranp get upset?
The president said "Newsanker" in a loud voice.
"There's nothing wrong with it."
After the first meeting, which took place in Singapore in June, and the major progress towards non-nuclearization in North Korea, he said, after the first meeting of the President, Kinshasa said that it was positive to the two-fold meeting.
But the non-nuclear trade is gone.
Even more than three months after a meeting in Singapore in June, the leader of North Korea's top diplomats told the world's leaders on Saturday, and we are still not able to verify the "response" response from the United States to the early military constraints in the country.
Instead, the Community said it was continuing to impose sanctions on them to put pressure on them.
The tramp showed a pleasant view of whether it was in Larispech.
"He's working with North Korea."
"Before, North Korea was trying to make war.
Millions of people will die.
Now it's a wonderful relationship."
Tranp says that efforts to improve North Korea have resulted in the end of the Missile Experiment, the release of an invalid personality, and the desired result of the conversion of American troops.
And he used a different picture when he talked about the relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but it's easier to call 200 people out of the audience than to call 200 people out of the audience," he said, pointing out.
In Indonesia, the tsunamis and earthquakes struck, and hundreds of people died.
In the rest of the London earthquake, for example, it was said that there was no need for foreign NGOs.
Although more than 10 percent of the people on the island of Lonbok have become homeless, there are no national disasters that need international assistance.
"Many times, unfortunately, we have made it clear that we do not ask for international help.
"Save the Children" is preparing to go to Paris, but it is still unknown whether foreign staff can operate on the ground.
Spocksman of the National Disasters Agency said that the Indonesian authorities are deciding whether to allow assistance to the international body to see the situation in Paris.
In view of Indonesia's ongoing earthquake, the country is not ready to take on natural anger.
The Athenians are built in the Athenians, but they are not on the other shores of the sea.
There's a lot of syllables in the palace, so if it's a syllable, it can save more lives than it is.
Although it's best time, going to Indonesia is very risky.
Natural disasters are becoming more and more complex.
The rescue ship that was stationed at Lombok to carry the people of the quake was porting to Paris, but it would take at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widde is investing funds on roads and roads and roads in the centre of the electoral movement in Indonesia.
However, despite the next year's re-election, there was a lack of funds to support Mr. Joko's government.
President Joko is under pressure from the growing religious tensions in Indonesia, where most Muslims have more faith than ever before.
More than 1,000 people have died and millions have been expelled from their homes.
I'm sorry, Daniel Starridge of Ribapore, an Icholyzer VSchelles.
Daniel Starge, who beat Ribapore on Saturday, hit Chelsea in Premierg, won't have 89 minutes in London's Stanford Bridge.
The Starridge was about 30 yards away from Chelsea's throat when she received a passport from Sheldan Shakyri, and his team was busy with 1-0.
He taps the ball to the left and jumps into the firepost.
The ball went up or up the gorilla and fell on the right net.
The ball's been hit by a jumper, Alizabaraga, and it's become a gorilla.
"Because it's as soon as a player like Chuck can, he was just trying to take his own ball to his position, and he just tried to play his game within time."
"When I saw the cante coming, I got a little bit touched, and I just hit the shock."
Chelsea, who took the point from Edenhazard, a Belgian Star in 25 minutes, is leading at the time of the Haftime.
Bruce's trainer was trying to avoid the path to Matthew Covachichi, near Midfield, and he ran to Ribapul.
Covachichi made a very early gibundgore in Midfield.
And then I left the beautiful slopas and forced them to go to Gol.
He broke the difens and went to the fireplace, and he hit the right-hand side of the shirt to cross the Arizona Baker of Ribapore.
On the rainy day in Italy, the stadium of St. Paul in Naples fought with Naples at the Campions League's club three o'clock in the afternoon.
In London on Thursday, Chelsea will fight UFA Europe's videoton at 3 p.m.

A 44-year-old man injured in Johnson Museum was found at 7:55 a.m. and a 32-year-old man was arrested.
The police are calling on the people of the area to provide information.

In particular, they're listening to taxi drivers because they might be filming important to the investigation.
The police Spocksman confirmed that the woman's body was found in the Belkenhead area and died inside the house.
The following afternoon a friend who knew the woman came to the scene to hear about the place where she was found this morning.
The police are the last to inform the victim's neighborhood, and the investigation is under way.
When the taxi driver in Grayson Museum wants to return to his building, he says he can't get out of the building.
When I understood what was happening, he didn't laugh at anything.
Now, it's been told that it's a few hours later that the residents are allowed to enter.
The police heard that the entire town was being treated as a murder scene.
The woman was crying, and she appeared at the scene.
I kept saying, "That's bad."
At 2:00 p.m., Patcar was in two laps, and there was another one right outside.
A number of police officers were in the lobby watching the building block.
If you have information about DM @merPolCC, call 101, call 0800 555 111 and report log247 on 30 September.
It'll be the latest memories of the "recording of history" in the Chromwell House of the National Council.
Its withdrawal was the righteousness of the psalm, which was against the destruction of many British cultural and religious artifacts, such as Taliban.
Mr. Crick said, "Cromowell is trying to change history."
Mr. John Goldsmiss, President of Cromwell Society, said: "The object of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster's temple was that it was not possible to avoid this debate on withdrawal.
The symbols of the British internal war were ordered to Cromwell, but not executed.
Perhaps the different Cromwell was sacrificed by the actions of the ancient Tomas.
A large statement by William Hamo Sonnicroft is proof of 19th-century thinking and is part of a historical record of people who believe that many people still have the value of celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmiss said to the Daily Telegraph: "Cromowell has been protecting the parliament against extremism by the late 19th century, and of course it is the rule of law.
It's the purpose of the historical debate that will continue to be fully expressed.
Indeed, the conflict in the mid- 17th century has shaped the post-development of the country, and Cromwell is a person who can be recognized as a distinct side.
His role as a prosecutor is also celebrated and worthy of memory."
Klarpig's molluscs kill Chinese farmers.
According to local media, farmers in the South China market were attacked and killed.
A man who knew only the name “Yuan” was cut off in the six-water market in the state of Hussan, and found around the orphanage in a bloodbath, reports the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, farmers in China's western coastal town, China, were prevented from fishing.
He was moving to sell 15 heads in a nearby market because he was in the winter.
In the morning, he was dead and found that the door of the nearby bathroom was open.
It's like a big bone of the blood.
According to the report, the medical investigation confirmed that 550 pounds had led to the death of farmers.
"Well, this foot was called boloboro because of blood."
The surveillance camera showed Yuan's entry into the market to make a fire at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday afternoon.
The body was about an hour after death.
I didn't know what happened to Yuan.
The market manager told Evening News that they were separated so that no one would hurt them and that the police were collecting evidence.
Yuan's family and market leaders are said to be negotiating a deal about his death.
But there's an example of an attack on humans before.
In 2016, in Masachust's agricultural area, the hunter attacked the woman and her husband and caused serious damage to their husband.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound strike stopped the Welsh farmers in the truck, and the wife was able to hunt animals.
In 2012, after the Oregon farmers were eaten on the farm, some of the Manitoba farmers told CBC News that they were not usually attackable, but that blood taste would be "extended".
"I'm just trying to play.
I don't want to be curious about my children.
It's just that you have to deal with it properly with your own conscience."
The remnants of Harrikenrozer also bring rain to the south of the United States.
According to the report, Halikenroza is weak in the way of passing cold waters in the north of Mexico City.
But in the next few days, the rain will continue to flow to North Mexico and South America.
Rosa's air was 85 miles per hour in the morning, when she was in the category 1-level Harriken.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
On the other hand, a new ship was born in the Pacific, heading east to the coast of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa brought 10 inches [10 inches] of rain to Mexico.
And when the heat of the storm is moving along with the nearby traffic, there will be a massive wave in the south-west in the next few days.
In the area, the rain of 1-4 inches [4 inches] of water, soil, and soil poses a threat.
The temperature is very cold, especially in the southern part of Arizona and Nevada, which is between 2 and 3 inches per hour.
Some of the south-west, especially most of Arizona, is going to fall from 2 to 4 inches [2 to 4 inches] of rain.
There is a fear that the rain of the storm is caused by the prevailing nature of the rain and that the situation is rapidly deteriorating.
So it's very dangerous to travel in the desert without heat.
There is fear that the river will become a river, and there will be a storm and a great wind, and there will be an abundance of locusts.
The nearby traffic also brings heavy rains on the South California coast.
There's a possibility that rain will drop more than 0.5 inches in total.
This is the first rain in this area.
During the first half of the day and in the early part of the month, the storm came close to Al-Ali-Zina, and the rains began to rise in the mornings and the flames.
And the rain fell upon them on the day of the morning, and on the day of the drink.
In October, temperatures in the United States are changing rapidly to lower temperatures, but heat levels are getting worse.
There are times when you invite a dramatic change of temperature in the short distance.
There's an example of a dramatic climate difference in Central America on Sunday.
There are almost 20 degrees of temperature in Kansas City, Omaha in Nebraska, St. Louis, Iowa.
During the next few days, the weather's rising again.
It's estimated that 80 degrees in the southeastern part of the forest will rise from 80 degrees in the north, and many in the Central United States are expected to become hot in October.
New York could reach 80 degrees, which is about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term weather reporting is a lot more than average temperature in the Americas just before October.
More than 200,000 people are listening to Bret Kavano.
More than 200,000 women who claimed to have been victims of sexual abuse in the 1980s were in the forest at six television networks, claiming to have been a victim of the Supreme Court of Justice.
On the other hand, in the basement of Friday, Prime Minister Jeff Frack of the Arizona Chamber of Directors for the week-to-day investigation of the FBI, the agency stopped the regular program and continued political support.
Ford told the Supreme Court of Justice that she had caught Kavano and convinced her that she was trying to remove her clothes from the high school party.
Cavano strongly testified that it was never going to happen.
It seems that on Friday, according to Nelson, more than 200 million people saw it.
At this time, the company's visual rate was averaged by CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, MSNBC.
The number of other companies, such as PBS, C-SPAN, Fox Business Network, could not be reached immediately.
There's a problem with the people who are always at the office.
It's the same number as football matches and academics.
Fox News Channel is a guest who has received an average of 56.6 million viewers on the first day of the hearing, because of his own opinion, he strongly supports Kavano's appointment.
ABC was the second of thirty-two million viewers.
According to Mr. Nylsen, CBS is 30 million, NBC is 294 million, MSNBC is 289 million, and CNN is 252 million.
I was talking about it after I heard it.
Frank was the manager of the Friday.
The members of the Health Party made a statement in support of Cavano's vote, and on Friday morning, he was approached by CNN and CBS reporters, who were called by the protesters.
He was shutting his eyes while he was being tortured, not leaving CNN's life.
"I'm standing in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
He said, "Because women are weak, you have strength."
According to Frank, his office made a statement and told him that he should say more about the committee's hearings before the elevator closes.
A few hours later, when all the delivery agencies began to issue their nominations to Cavano, and all the members of the House of Commons were voting.
But he said that, as a minority of the Democratic Party claims, the FBI will only investigate the candidates for the next week.
He was convinced that he was meeting with Chris Coins, a member of the House of the Democratic Party of His Friends.
After a meeting with the Cons and the other vice president, Frank made a decision.
It was a powerful choice, because without an investigation, it was obvious that the joint party could not vote to appoint Cavano.
President Tranp has asked for Kavano to investigate to the FBI.
The British Prime Minister has condemned the criticism of "political interference" on the watch of the budget.
Prime Minister Teresa May condemned the idea that, in an interview with the Sande Times, the EU is making the future of the United Kingdom a political attraction for the benefit of the country.
British Prime Minister Teresa May will attend the Burmingham Conservative Party meeting in England on 29 September 2018.
In other acquisitions, her outside editor, Boris Johnson, emphasised his attack on the so-called Czech plan to collect taxes from Britain and the EU.
As for the death of the LSU player, who was attacked by Weide Simms, the police arrested the suspects of the Dayon Simpson.
The police arrested 20-year-old LSUbasketball player, who was shot by Weide Sims and killed suspects.
Dayton Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested for his second murder, and the Baton Rouge police said he was arrested.
The authorities opened the video and showed that Sims and Simpson were in trouble, and the police pointed out that Sims had lost the machine in the process.
The police found the megaton at the scene and reported that there was a DNA found in Simpson's CBS series.
After hearing about Simpson, the police said he admitted that he had shot Wade and had a fatal accident.
It was reported to be $350,000.
On Friday, the East Baton Rouge Bureau issued a preliminary report that death is a head-to-head weapon.
The Board expressed its appreciation that the police forces in the state of Louisiana, the State Police Institute, the South University police and the local citizens had been able to overcome their arrests.
Joe Areva, director of the LSUA's Auslectic Director, expressed his appreciation for the "work and the pursuit of justice" of the Regional Law Executives.
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, and Wayne, his father, made a basketball ball in LSU.
He got 5.6 points in last season and 2.6 libbonds.
In the morning of the Friday morning, according to the LSU cochi Will Wede, the team's death of the Weide is "lost" because of shock.
"I was scared," says Wade.
In Mexico, the mountains are burning in ashes.
The dust flowed from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern part of Mexico City.
The National Emergency Center warned of the day of the earthquake that it would withdraw from the volcano and recorded 183 gas and dust emissions 24 hours from the crater.
The center was watching the storm and the quake.
The SNS image shows how the car's front glass is covered by dust coverings in Mexico's area, such as Sochimílco.
The geologists confirmed that, since the magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017, there was an increase of 45 miles (72 km) in the eastern part of the city.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been alive since 1994.
Controls the date of the independent vote, and the Catalans are in conflict with the police.
On Saturday, six people were arrested after the police and riots in Barcelona, and thousands of people participated in the annual memorial demonstration of the Catalan party's decision.
When a group of close-fashioned relatives were forced into the mob, they threw their eggs and falsifiers, and they always made dark clouds by means of a visit.
Scaffles used their security personnel to stop the war and act with the police during that day.
In a few hours, a group of independent groups called, "I'm not forgetting, I'm not sorry."
According to local newspaper, 14 people are being beaten and treated by protesters.
Although Madrid has been viewed as illegal, tensions are rising in areas of independence after one year from the national vote blessed by the separatist Catalans on 1 October.
The number of votes in favour was overwhelmingly independent, but the opposite was low because of the boycott.
According to the Catalan authorities, the police tried to stop the elections at the polls in the area where there were serious conflicts of the past year, where about 1,000 people were injured.
The independent group spent the night on Friday night trying to stop the demonstrators with the support of the national police.
The work has progressed, but it has been neglected in other ways.
The electrician who participates in the activities of his wife and separatists, Narciss Telmes, 68, says that there is no hope for an independent Catalan.
"It was a great opportunity last year.
I saw my parents vote and cry, but now they're gone."
Although the regional elections held last December have not only won the victory, the independent Catalan party has been struggling to do so this year for the good leaders whose role in the organisation of national votes and their subsequent independent declarations is being put on trial for their own lives and for the good leaders who are detained.
The 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests on the phone for the police said Joan Pyg said the conflict was intensified by both politicians.
He says, "I'm pressing."
Oliver Funkeras was one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been sentenced since last year, but he announced on Sunday that he would go to the European Parliament's elections next year.
"To fight Europe's elections is the best way to condemn the view and pressure of democracy that we have received from the Spanish Government."
The men who had been arrested by London's car.
33 years old, 34 years old, 39 years old, three men were arrested every time they went to Londonbury's house.
The incident occurred at 1930 hours at BST in Barinagard Crencent.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said the doors and buildings were damaged.
There's also a pattern of the crossbows fired from the car.
In Manga Street, Livingstone won the Rangers 1-0.
In the first round by Drey Menga, he confirmed the victory of Livingstone.
Livingstone was surprised by the fact that Stephen Gerard of the Blacks Club was given a double victory in 18 trials.
Because Gary Hort's side combined the second hybrid with the level, there was evidence that there was a difference in the attack by Dry Menga.
Gerrard's side remains unconquered in this session's Premiership, and the next Sunday is faced with 8 points of Leader's hardware, which will be played on Sunday.
In the past, the Rangers of the Spring Day will launch a rapid wine in Europe.
Livingstone, in the meantime, increases their failures in the department's 6 games, and since he's exchanged the last week's Kenyan mail, he's still going to enjoy the North.
Livingston's running out of chances for a decent visitor.
The Holt team would have been leading ahead before it got there, and that directness caused any problems in Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke down and moved his efforts towards the goal, and then Alan Lithgow was able to direct a lot of efforts after that slide to fill Craig Halket's heading.
The host was satisfied that Rangers could play in front of his eyes.
And it's the way it's achieved the important goal.
The Rangers accepted the freecrack, and Livingstone set up a band to combine opening, declanger and Robinson.
By that time, the Rangers had control of everything, but they couldn't bring home difens, and Liam Kelly of Golkiper was not even demonized.
Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's soap, but his pattern continued to last.
Scott Pitman was denied seeing the foot of the Rangers Golkipper Alanmakrager and Risgore's foot spread from another Livingstone play.
The cross went into Livingston's box and was kept clean, and Halket was replaced by Glenn Middleton, and one of the two penniless classrooms for handball.
Livingstone's "excessive" analysis.
Alasdearmont of BBC Scotland, in Tonimacania.
Livingston's amazing papermans.
For men, they're very good, and they're still looking forward to the trails above.
Their style and appearances have not changed much since they returned to top speed, but he has had to go to Holt for the way he has provided electricity to the team since he arrived.
He had a lot of heroes.
Although Menga was trying to trap Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall, Halket's captain made a very well-organized defense.
But Ranger was missing an impression.
They were as good as they were under Gerard sometimes, and they didn't get enough to meet their standards.
Their final ball was missing -- they only opened homeside -- and it's like a wake-up call for Rangers.
Erdon, we're gonna have a reception at Kellen.
On Saturday (September 29th), Turkish and German leaders gathered for the morning meal in Berlin, and there was laughter and red air.
This is the last day that President Erdon visited Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO's member states.
They discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of speech and the EU of Turkey.
Eldon wanted to open a huge new museum to Keren.
This city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police gave reasons for security to prevent more than 25,000 strong groups from meeting in front of Moscow, but many of the supporters soon identified themselves as meeting their presidents.
Hundreds of protestors (and many of the Kurdish) also heard their voices and condemned the decision of the German government to welcome him and his fellow state.
The protest of the conflict reflects the disparity between the visitors and those who are criticized by others, who are welcomed by a few Germans.
Deptoford was killed in a car crash.
In London a car crash took place, and the driver died.
The incident took place near the border between Westwood Street and Ebrin Street at 10:15 a.m. in the town of Deptoford, in the southeastern part of the city.
The driver stopped and the rescue team stopped, but the man died in the scene.
A month later, another driver was killed by a car accident that left about a mile away from the quake on Saturday, and he fled to Chailder Street.
The Metropolitan police said the police are encouraging the men's identity and their relatives to report.
The road is closed and the bus's back is executed, and the driver is advised to avoid it.
I was shocked by six guards watching the London prison.
I was shocked by the presence of six guards at the men's prison.
The movement continues to occur on the day of the English era at 09:30.
The expert's "Torned" guard was called to deal with the movement of eight prisoners in the camp.
The police took me to the scene with their hands on my face.
The representative of the prison said: "Special training has been provided to deal with what is happening in HMPLgradin.
Six staffmen have got their hands on me.
We don't allow violence in prison, those who are responsible will be mentioned by the police and spend longer in prison."
HMPLongradin has arrested more than 500 prisoners, bringing together the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison officer was reported to have been attacked by prisoners and treated at the hospital.
And last October, the team was called into prison to deal with the profound attacks by staff on the wall of Bilyyard.
In the case of Phoenix, Lasbegas, and Soltreichtitis, in Harrikenroza, there is a risk (maybe there is a benefit in the affected region)
It's hard to see the heat down on Alisonna, but the risk of carbon monoxide from the beginning of the week is very high for the remaining energy of Harikenroza to cross the south-west desert.
The National Weather Agency has already issued a report on the day of the moon and the day of the fire, Phoenix, Flagsstaff, Lasbegas, and Soltrecht, from the West, to the south and east, to the south and south of California and to the south.
Rose will approach the rain later in the month and be rewarded with standing in Phoenix on the day of the fire.
Fenix's National Weather Agency said on Twitter: "There have been only 10 hot climates that have kept the heat currents of 200 miles from Fenix since 1950!
Catrine (1967) was Harriken within 40 miles of the AZ border. "
The latest national Harrican Center model is expected to be two to four inches of rain, and in Arizona’s Mogolonrim, the largest six inches of rain.
The other area in the Southwest desert, which includes Central Rocky and Great Beach, is likely to be between 1 and 2 inches and up to the largest 4 inches of the same type.
Because the area is affected by the damage it has caused to the people who are not at risk of evaporation.
Water is a very serious problem, but the South West is now in a state of shock, and some of the rain is likely to be beneficial.
According to the United States, there are at least 40 percent of Arizona's high levels of pollution, which is in the second highest category," and weather.com monitors reported.
At first, the way to Harikanloza is to cross the Gulf of Bahacalifornia, Mexico.
Halicenroza's strength is the highest speed of 85 miles per day in the morning and is up to 12 miles north when it is located at 385 miles south of Punta Yuginia, Mexico.
It's getting cold water in the Pacific, and it's losing its power.
It is expected that in the afternoons of the month, or at night, the temperature will rise to Mexico.
There's a lot of potential floods in all parts of Mexico, and there's a huge risk of floods.
"The amount of rain from 3 to 6 inches, the maximum of 10 inches is expected from Bahacalifornia to the north-west Sonora," said weather.com.
Roosevelts will cross Mexico as a hot storm in the morning as a result of the hot climate in the early mornings and reach the southern part of the U.S.
"Roza, and the main risk of its impact, are much of the flood in the North, North, North, and North America. "The South-West Isles of the West," said the National Halican Center.

The police are waiting for someone who has a picture of what happened on the phone.
Tranp says Cabano is suffering from the humiliation and anger of the Democratic Party.
"The vote for the judiciary is a vote that shows the refusal of the Democratic Party to resort to cruel and violent methods."
Tranp said in his appointment process that Cabano is suffering from the "difficulty and anger of the Democratic Party."
Cabano witnessed before the March Congress and strongly denied her claim that they had violated the Christian Brigford sexual code decades ago.
Fide also testified in court about her claim.
The president said on Saturday, "The Americans saw the beauty and courage of Cabano that day."
"The vote to admit the Cabano judge is one of the most trained legal spirit in our time, a vote that recognises legal experts who have a great record of public service." He told the Group of Supporters in West Virginia.
While the president was talking about the importance of the participants in the mid-election, he said a long time ago about Cabano's proposal.
"To one of the most important choices in our life, five weeks.
I'm not going out, but I'm actually running."
"So I'm everywhere to fight for the wonderful guests."
Tranp argued that the Democratic Party's mission is to "response and hinder."
The GOP Prime Minister told CNN that the vote will continue to be the first key to the summit in Cabano's appointment.
Hundreds of people died in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunamis, and the victims grew.
At least 384 people were killed in a massive earthquake and tsunami on the island of Slavishi in Indonesia, and many people were killed on the day of the earthquake.
Hundreds of people gathered at the festival on Friday at the death battle in Paris, and when they were asleep, they were forced by waves to the shores of six feet (18 m) and many were killed, and all roads were destroyed.
Zingbo continued in Magnitwood 7.5 earthquake.
"When yesterday's threat of Zingbo was in sight, people were killed because they didn't get away with their activities immediately at the beach."
"There's not a single sink, a car, a tree, a house, and a roof all over the country."
Some people went to the trees to escape from the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 people fled to 24 cents in Paris.
Many buildings and shops were destroyed, the bridge was destroyed, and the Moscow was surrounded by water.
The rest of the city was still in the coastal city on Saturday.
There were 2400,000 people in Elijah, who could sense a single earthquake.
Indonesia's assessment technology use (BPPT) was reported to have been about 200 times the power of atomic bombs dropped on the islands during World War II.
He said there's a huge possibility that the size of Zingo is on the city's edge, which is on the edge of a long, deep valley.
He explained that the damage was "wide" and that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
Some of the victims' bodies were discovered under the wall of the destroyed building, and he said that 540 people were suspicious of me and 29 were ignorant.
Hangroho said that the dead and the injured were 300 km north of Paris, which is more severe than the area called Dongara near the quake.
"The information from Donggara was completely out of operation," said Hangroho.
Over 300,000 people live there," said the Red Cross, adding that they are heading towards areas affected by Staff and Volunteers.
"It's already a tragedy, but it's probably even worse."
Officials say the storm has occurred in the alarm, but the authorities were widely criticized on Tuesday for not informing the authorities that Zinbo had attacked Paris.
In the Amaju video shared in social media, I heard men at the top of the building were warning of the danger of death coming to the people on the streets.
Within a few minutes, the walls of the water were on the shore, and the buildings and cars were flooded.
Reuters couldn't verify the video immediately.
It's difficult to connect the authorities' rescue operations because of the heavy power of earthquakes and tsunamis and the lack of communication around Paris.
The army is starting to carry relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities on freight transport, but refugees still need food and other basic necessities.
The city airport has been reopened only for rescue operations, but it will be closed until October.
President Joko Widde is scheduled to visit Paris's refugee center on Sunday.
There are more than 800 people who are victims of the tsunami in Indonesia.
It's too bad.
The staff of the World Vision of Donggar was about nothing at the city of Paris, where employees were fleeing from the watershed shelters set up at the headquarters of the Office, but they saw a strange view in the streets.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's too bad.
The rescue team began to show the movement to launch disaster relief activities, but some people claim that sea rescue workers with deep expertise are preventing the journey to Paris.
According to Indonesia's regulations, funds and supplies from the sea and human resources are being launched when disasters are declared a threat to the country.
It's not happening yet.
"It's still a disaster at state level."
"The government once said, 'I know, this is a disaster in the country.'
I was hoping that friends and family loved people would be a miracle of tragic stories of natural disasters on the two nights of the earthquake and the post-Sunboro.
On the day of the funeral, the boy was pulled out of the basement.
On Sunday, the rescuer rescued the woman who had fallen under the wall with her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Swandno, who is a member of the National Parking Team in Indonesia, trained the missing members of the Asian Congress, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were among the others who were arrested at the Loaara Hotel, including Mr. Mandaghi.
"As a Chinese in the area of Paraguay, I have my own emotional burden."
Mr. Gendon went to the paragliding community several hours after the collapse of the Loaral Hotel, and he said that he would send a message to the Parisn society that participated in the Beach Festival.
His message was the only result of the green mark instead of the green check.
"I think it means that the message has not been delivered."

Canya West: Lapper changed his name to Ya.
Rappercanie West will change his name to Ya.
When he announced a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "It's officially known as the Canyon West."
The 41-year-old West was sometimes named Yee, which was also used as the title of his 8th album, which was released in June.
His new album's launch of Yandhi will change it before it's scheduled for entry into the Sataday Trail.
He says he's going to show up instead of Alana Grande, who was cancelled for "sympathetic reasons."
In the same way as his current name, West said that in the past his words had a religious meaning for him.
"I believe that 'yes' is the best word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'."
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us."
It starts with the only meaning of Kenya, and it becomes our good and bad, confused, all of which is -- yes.
The album represents more than who we are."
He's one of many famous rappers who want to change his name.
Shawn Coms is known for his choice of the name Raband Brazarab this year.
And I'm going to put it on the list, and I'm going to put it on the list, and I'm going to write it down.
AMLO from Mexico swears to use the military against the general citizen.
Andres Manuel Robes Obradal, elected president of Mexico, swore that he would never exercise military force against the general citizens because the nation would receive 50 years of blood compensation for students.
Lopes Obrador promised that he would never use military force to control Mexican people on his birthday.
On October 2, 1968, when the left-wing student movement ended in Latin America, a peaceful demonstration was launched, and 300 people were killed.
Ropes Obradal offered monthly assistance to students, promised to support young people in Mexico more than the openness of the National University.
He said that young people are running into criminal gangs because of unemployment and lack of educational opportunities.
The United States should double its A.I. financial support.
China is more active than human science, and the United States should increase the amount of money available in the field of research, says Kai-Fu Lee, an AI operator in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Although the United States lacks the AI strategy as a whole, its comments were made after the AI was announced by various deployments of the U.S. government.
In the meantime, China introduced the plan last year: by 2030 it will focus on the first one for the AInobation.
It would be a good start to double the AI research budget if all the other countries were to consider something that was more late than the United States, and we were trying to make further progress in AI, Lee said.
The increase in funds will also increase the chances of the next major performance in the U.S.A., and Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book "Aisupparwars: China, Shiriconbare and the New World Order" has been released this month by Hoton Mifrin Harcott, a CEO of Synobession Bench, and the most famous AI company in China.
In the 1980s, he founded an Auseroployer system at the University of Carnegie Meron, and later became a member of the Google Chinese company of Microsoft Research.
Lee agreed to a technical conference of the former U.S. government, such as the Robertic Charenge of the National High Research Plan, and visited the next time to help find the next viewer.
A U.S. researcher is working a lifetime to get government aid, Lee said.
"It's not China's picking up a scientific leader; it's cooperation."
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired leaders from the University to study AI in recent years.
Lee said it would also help strengthen the integration of immigration policy and the U.S. AI.
"I think I should automatically give PhD to PhD in the AI field."
In July 2017, China's National Office launched a post-generation science development plan.
The National Fund for Natural Science in China is providing funding to academics in a way similar to that of the National Science Fund and other government agencies in the United States, but China's scientific research levels are low.
In the United States this year, the National Defence Department has set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to participate in business and academic partners, and the White House has announced the setting of the Special Committee on Human Sciences.
And this month, DARPA announced that 20 billion investments would go to the AI Next initiative.
NSF is currently investing more than $1 billion a year in AI research.
On the other hand, the United States rules for the establishment of a national security committee in human science are not seen in the course of months.
The Macedonians will vote in favour of the change in the name of the country.
Macedonians are moving to resolve the ten-year dispute between Greece and Greece that prevented membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a state called Macedonia, voted for accession to NATO and the EU, saying that the people of the northern part of the country are protesting against it.
The 2 Government has signed a new name-based agreement in June, but the national opposition argues that this change will destroy the national identity of the main Slav population in Macedonia.
President Georgi Ivanov is not voting on a national vote, and he is questioning whether the vote rate will fill at least 50 percent of the national vote that will be effective.
Read the question about the national vote: "We are proud that we have accepted the agreement with Greece to become NATO and the EU. "
Reformers, including Prime Minister Zhaoran Zaef, argue that it is worth participating in such an organization as the EU and NATO in Macedonia, one of the countries that has emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I will be able to live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer living for young people in Macedonia today for the future of the country, because it means safer living for all of us."
It is not legally binding, but it has been said that a sufficient number of people in Parliament are observing the results of the vote in favour of the decision.
The change in the name will require more than two thirds of Parliament.
The election committee said that there was no reports of misconduct until 1 p.m.
However, the vote of 66 percent was compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary vote in 2016, and the vote remained 16 percent.
"I have come to vote for my children, and our place is in Europe."
Prime Minister Zulán Zaef of Macedonia, his wife, Zurika and his son Dasko, took part in a national vote in Macedonia on the change in the name of the country to which they are going to take part in Stormiza, Macedonia, NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018.
Before the Skopje parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, drew up a chair in front of a tent set up by people who are willing to vote for a small stage.
"We have reached NATO and the EU, but not through the service door, but we want to participate." Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor countries, but there is violence.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, they can rely on China and other countries like Russia to become part of the European Union."
Prime Minister Zaef says the NATO unemployment rate is more than 20 percent of Macedonia's investment.
"I believe that the majority of the citizens support the EU and NATO because more than 80 percent of them support it."
He said the result of "Jesus" would be "the evidence of our future."
According to a survey published in the previous week by the Macedonian policy research agency, from 30 to 43 percent of voters said they would participate in national polls - they would drop the required voting rates.
In another survey conducted by Tel Metrevi in Macedonia, 57 percent of respondents were scheduled to vote on Sunday.
I said 70 percent of them would vote in favour.
In order to win national votes, 50 percent and one vote are required.
The failure of the national vote will result in the first serious attack on the U.S. government since the fall of last May.
I'm sorry: Sergio Aggero of Manchester is going to decide more than the perfect diaphens of Briton.
Serhio Aguero and Rahim Sterling won the 2-0 battle in Manchester on day-to-day at the Etyhad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero's 65-minute route has made it as simple as a scooze.
Alexander's stripper first got a pass in Midfield.
Before he went to the openfield, he had a fight with the three Briton difender.
Aguero was surrounded by four Greenschets.
He pushed a guy's difender and pulled a few more on the edge of the Britonbox.
And he found Starling and took his left leg out.
The representative of England FW used the stand-up tag in the box to return the ball to Aguero, and then put the hat on the right side of the grid to Briton's cupper, Mashua Ryan's left side.
"Aguero was suffering from foot problems."
"We talked about him, 55,60.
That's what happened.
"We were lucky that he had decided the Scoo at that time."
But it was Starling that gave the Advantages that started in the Premier War.
That gorilla happened in 29 minutes.
Aguero took the ball deep in the Britton area.
He sent a beautiful slopas along the left side to Reroy Sane.

But the contestant Shazer wants to pick up a coin for Colorado's daily, but it's only if the playoffs are still going to be affected by rocking the Rosanzels in the NLWest.
The Rockies won at least five or two World Card Spots on Friday night, but they want to make sure the first region wins.
"Even if we don't mean to play, we can throw at least, and we'll be able to join the crowd at any time this year's weather and other teams will be at the highest level of play.
You don't want to fight like that?"
The Nationals have not yet published a day's starter, but they report that Charles will be caught in such a situation.
Sherzer is scheduled to receive his 34-time start, and he is scheduled to be thrown into the bulpenssons on Thursday at the usual rest time of the day.
This is Shissen, Washington's right-wing shooter is 220 2/3 inches.
The tramp is gathering in West Virginia.
While the president was talking about the importance of the participants in the mid-election, he was talking about the situation in which the Supreme Court was elected by Bret Cabano.
"All we've been through is about November.
"To one of the most important choices in our life, five weeks.
It's a big--it's one, but I'm not going out, but I'm actually running, so I'm here to fight for the wonderful guests."
The tramp went on, "Look at this terrible group of extremist democracies, and we'll find out what's going on right now.
And they're going to use the means they need to take power back, and they're going to know that it's not easy at the bottom.
They don't care who harms themselves in order to gain power and power, or who doesn't have to ignore anyone, because they want power and power, and we don't give them it."
He said that the Democrats are missioning to "response and hinder."
"And it's going to happen in the last four days."
He met with the Supreme Court of Justice to appoint Prime Minister Diane Fainstein, a member of the Democratic Party, and received a great campaign from the audience.

The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
I can't stand people who can't talk to my heart.
It was hardly surprising when my local political party's monumental activists voted against me.
Finally, I'm on the front line of the MPs who say I'm not welcome -- everything's talking about the spirit.
John Ryan, a co-chairman of my country's parliament, was treated as if he had stood up for anti-Jewishism.
In my case, guilt moved me to disagree with Jeremy Colbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, and in Europe was also a problem that Jeremy did not agree with the past leader.
"We want to make meetings inclusive and productive," he said, at a meeting of the Nottingham East Labour Party on Friday.
For most of my eight years as a local labor force, the GC meeting on Friday night was exactly like that.
Unfortunately, today is not a lot of meetings, and if it really started, the promise of a "better and better" policy was long forgotten.
It has become clear that there are no different views on the working party, and it is only possible to decide whether all views are acceptable to the party's leaders.
This started as soon as Jeremy became the leader, and my former colleagues thought they had shared a political view like I had before, and they wanted me to take a position that had not yet been taken, and they seemed to agree on national security and on a single market in the EU.
When I made a statement, it was not important for me to speak -- the withdrawal of the election requirement, which continued to arouse hatred for the centre's policy-based social media, and I should not enter the working party.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, the comments I've received are political, and I think that I'm happier than some of my colleagues.
They are faced every day with the scourge of sexual discrimination or racial discrimination, and they have a sense of respect for one another's interests and determination.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how it has become common to deal with abuse.
The previous week, Jeremy Colbin claimed that the working party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a large church, and all "no self-confidence" movement, or changes in party election rules, are getting smaller.
For the past two years, I've made many suggestions like, "It's all good."
But I didn't get into politics to do it.
Since my participation in the study as a student 32 years ago, I have been fired by the sachet government that literally destroyed my joint school classroom, and I have tried to support better public service for those who need it most.
I never hid my policy, including my previous election.
There was no confusion in the Nightingamist about my policy position and the area where no one was in conflict with the leaders.
For those who have promoted that movement on Friday, what I am saying is that the country has suffered from a budget that damages families, businesses and our public service, and cannot understand the prospect of losing the energy that I am loyal to my time and employer leaders.
But the message from me is that I do not want to be a member of the working party, not to mention Nottingham, but that I am proud of what I do for you, and I promise that I will not restrict my actions from my belief that other than threats or political alliances are the best interests of all of you.

E. 38 - 17 Melrose:
The final results may have changed over the delay of the two three, but the AA is absolutely worth winning the prize match of today's great entertainment tennis.
Now they're on the top of the table and only 10 failures.
Finally, in order to have a better chance of having a better diaphens, Peter Marche of Cotch took home.
"We've been tested by the experiment so far, and we're still weak and should be grateful."
Robin Cristy of Melrose said, "Trust in Ea; they've missed a better chance than us."
The 14-minute drive from Grand Anderson instead of Fražer Creimo was pressed before, but the deal was started by Walliers, sent numbers to Melloz by Roy Hughes's card, and Jason Baggett picked up an unchanged trip.
Clymo quickly extended his flight to the AE in Penalti, and decided to take Solotley to EA at 17-5.
But Melrose went to the back, and Patrick Anderson's trio from Baggot was down at five o'clock.
Then, after a long time for Laurid Nott, who was taken back to the seriously injured stretcher, and after reopening, Aa made more progress than Stafford McDowell's trip.
Brian McFerson of the Acting Captain has received Eurocard, and at the end of his powerful press release, Melrose has paid off the remaining players in the Bruce Colvin trial.
However, they returned homeside, and Shatsulan Hachinson took a ticket to Climus without a ball, and placed it in the back of McFerson's front room from Penaltiline out.
After Kyle Row gathered David Armstrong's boxchecks, he almost re-started and sent Gregor Henry of Franker to the 5th trio of Homeside.
The Steel Game Star will build a new career in the restaurant.

There's a lot of blue flags on public buildings.
From the Chichka Island to the Amazon, the sea base is covered by motorcycles: "The sea is ours because of the right of the sea.
It's a duty to take it back."
The memories of the coastal border lost in Chile in the 19th century in the midst of a conflict of blood through the country's Bolivia are still clear -- once again, it's an island that sails across the Pacific.
On 1 October, Bolivia was waiting for the International Court of Justice for a five-year trial, and these hopes were probably the best for decades.
"Bolivia is strong and has a calm and peaceful spirit, and of course she is looking forward to the outcome with a certain perspective," said Bolivian diplomat Robert Calzadira.
Many Bolivians are looking forward to seeing the ICJ's decision on the national scene, and the Hague Court of Justice has been looking forward to reaching the Bolivian claim that after a proper agreement, Chile will have a duty to export sovereignty to Bolivia to the sea.
The president of Bolivia's Kalisma peoples, who are faced with the re-election next year, will also participate in the decision of Sunday, Ebo Morares.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts think that the possibility that the tribunal would benefit Bolivia is low, and that would not change much.
The Netherlands's federal agency does not have the right to grant the Chilean territory and provides that it must decide on the possible outcome of the agreement.
The ICJ's decision was made only six months after the final debate, which showed that the case was "not complex," said Paz Zarate, an international legal Chilean party.
And to advance the cause of Bolivia, it may have been delayed in the past four years.
"The issue of access to the sea was raised by the current Bolivian government."
Moralez's well-being retraced the rest of Chile, she pointed out.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk for a while, but it is very difficult to continue the debate after this.
Since 1962, two countries have not exchanged Ambassadors.
President Edward Rodrigues Weltz, representative of Bolivia, of the Hague, denied the idea that the decision of the court would be unusual.
On Monday, Bolivia will be a "special opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile," and it will bring an end to the gap between the three hundred years' opinions on mutual interests.
Calzadira also denied that Morales (one of the most popular presidents in Latin America) was using the sea as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific," he added.
"It's an opportunity to know that we have to go through the past."
North Korea will say that nuclear weapons will not happen if they can't trust the United States.
North Korea's outside Ri-Yonho says if we can't trust Washington, our country will never release nuclear weapons first.
Lee was talking at the National Assembly on Saturday.
He asked the United States to abide by the promise made at the Singapore summit.
His comment is made by U.S. Prime Minister Mike Pompeo, who seems to be trying to reopen the advanced nuclear diplomatic mission from Singapore, North Korea, which has been taking part in over three months.
Ri says that the United States' opposition to the declaration to continue sanctions and end the Korean war is an "unforeseen dream".
Washington warns that peacekeepers will agree to this declaration without first entering an important military force.
President Donald Tranp, Kim and both of the Americans, want two brains to talk.
But there is widespread suspicion that the weapon's only way to ensure security is to be left behind.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit the beach to prepare for the meeting of the 2-year-old Kim-Tramp.
Paris's approach is to open the new line of a large headway and take it to your nearest highway.
This is where you decide to increase the collection of hats or to block the sun completely.
Varentino and Tom Brown of the designer announced a unique cross-sectional linemap for the S.S.19 collection at the Runway, which attracted the style in Paris.
Very unrealistic hits sat in this summer, and these designers sent their eyes to Catwook.
The work that attracted the attention of Valentino was the cover of the supersa top, which was covered with the head of the model.
The other supersize accessory had a treasured scarf, magic hat, and other pineapples, but it was not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also opened a series of wonderful masks, and we met between Halloween.
Many of the masks were more colorful, and they were more like the Hannibal Laker than they were called Autochul.
One of the works was similar to the complete Scoobar Diaving Gigai in Schnokel and Google, but the other was like an ice cream coon.
And if you continue to grow in your imagination, you're lucky.
Faction experts are predicting that a great bonnet will be able to go to your nearest highway.
The special size hats are heated from Riana to Emily Latajkopsky, with 2 feet wide open to anyone.
The cult-Brand, behind the very unreal hat behind the social media, sent another big piece of work to Katwook -- a model of water-filled water-stained, almost as big as a bottlebag.
Rafiafring was an internal work at the La RivierasS19 collection of Jacobs, in Paris.
Luke Armité, a celebrity-stylelist, said to the F.C.C., "In the summer of the year, big hats and beechbags are expected to appear in high Street. -It's difficult for designers to ignore the needs of the Oversize Accessories.
John Edward: Language School for Global Citizens · Global Voices
The private schools in Scotland have maintained excellent academic performance, and this has continued to be another set of excellent experiences that have been strengthened by sports, art, music and the individual and collective success of other communities until 2018.
These schools, which have more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, are working for representatives of the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), are trying to provide the highest level of service for students and defenders.
Private schools focus on providing students with higher education, their choice of careers, and their social life as citizens of the world.
In this educational sector that is able to design and implement a school curriculum in Custom Media, it is clear that today’s language continues to be a school’s wish science.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you say something that you can understand, it goes into the person's head.
And when he speaks in his mother's tongue, it enters his heart."
This reminds us that we should not rely solely on English when building relationships and trust with other people.
As a result of this year's recent trial, language is the top of the Rig Table, and the higher the quality of private school students.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received high-grade A.
Data collected from 74 schools of SCIS show that 72 percent of the students who learn Beijing are getting high grade A, 72 percent of those who learn German, 69 percent of those who learn French, and 63 percent of those who learn Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are encouraging foreign language learning as an important skill that children and young people need in the future.
The current language is treated as the same choice of STEM science (scientific, technology, engineering, mathematics) as a private school curriculum.
In a 2014 survey of the British Employment Skills Commission, 17 percent found that because of the fact that employees were suffering from a shortage of language skills, 17 percent felt that they had a lack of language skills.
So there's a language squill for young people to prepare for the future career.
In cases where there is an increased opportunity for work that requires language to be made available by globalization, these skills are not necessary.
Whatever career you choose, if you get a foreign language, you're going to have this kind of life cycle, and you're going to be really useful in the future.
The fact that we can communicate directly with foreigners means that the Marchilinga people are in a position to compete.
According to a survey conducted by over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent did not have enough foreign language skills to meet, and the ratio of people to speak in 2 foreign languages was only 15 percent French.
That's why it's important for children today to invest in language education.
In particular, children in developing countries will be more likely to get meaningful jobs by having multiple linguistic skills.
In Scotland, there are different languages taught by different schools.
Many schools focus on more traditional modern languages, but other schools will be able to teach languages that are the most important for Britain, based on the year 2020, such as Beijing and Japan.
Whatever interest children may have, there is a wide range of language choices in private schools in this area.
The private schools in Scotland are focusing on providing learning environments, such as preparing children for the future and providing them with the necessary skills to succeed.
In the global business environment, language is very important for the future of the country, and it needs to be reflected in education.
In fact, today's language should be called the international communication cycle.
Private schools will continue to provide young people in Scotland with this choice and diversity and better education.
I'm gonna have to do it.
John Edward is a member of the private council in Scotland.
Lebron, Sunday's Sunday's Sunday's Sunday's Sunday's Sunday's Sunday,
The Libron James is still looking forward to the Rosanzels Raykers show.
Laker's director Luke Walton announced that James would come out on Sunday at the opening battle with the Danber Nagetz of San Diego.
But I don't know how long he's playing.
"It's going to be less than 48 minutes short."
Reeker's reporter, Mike Trudell, tweets that James will only spend a limited amount of time.
After the first training this week, James was asked about six test schedules for Raykers' presentation.
"At this stage of my career, there is no need for a presence game to be prepared for the season."
Lary, West Virginia, tramp, YouTube Channel.
President Donald Tranp starts a election meeting from West Virginia tonight.
This is the first place in the next five-week meeting, including a friendly place in tennis and Mississippi.
Now that the nomination of the Supreme Court of Justice is a reservation, the Tranp aims to strengthen its support towards the coming mid-election because the joint party is at risk of losing more than half of the parliamentary elections in November.
When will the meeting be held in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
The meeting in Wiering, West Virginia, of the tramp, is scheduled to be scheduled for 7 p.m. on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
Larry, in West Virginia, of the tramp, can watch online on the next YouTube live stream.
While the FBI investigates the sexual suspicions of the Supreme Court of Justice Brit Cabanno, the admission of votes in the upper chamber has been extended to a maximum of 1 week, and in an urgent situation, the tramp is likely to comment on this week's public meeting.
But the main aim of this ongoing meeting is to strike against the forces of the Communist Party facing a difficult war in November's election.
According to Reuters, in the speech of President Tranp, the next five weeks' meeting aims to "increase the level of volunteering and support" in order to protect the majority of parliaments held by the House and the House of Commons.
"The security of the majority of parliamentarians is very important to his policy, and the president will be able to visit as many states as possible to the election session."
According to Western Virginia's Metronius, the meeting scheduled at Wesbancoaryna in Wierling's Westburna is likely to gather supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be reported on in Pittsburgh media.
Tranp won more than 40% divide in West Virginia in 2016, but Western Virginia visits on Saturday will be twice a month.
Tranp is trying to support Patrick Morissa, a former member of West Virginia, who is late in the secular investigation.
According to Reuters, political scientist Simon Heder of West Virginia University said, "The president is not a good sign for Morrisie."
Leadercap 2018: U.S. elections show the desire to fight with hope and hope for tomorrow's syngloss.
After a three-session trial, the afternoon afternoon forum opened up which leadership needed.
In sports, the concept of "power" is not fundamental, but especially in this art, players really believe in "power."
So who's going to have a lot to do today?
"We think we have a little bit of time now because we're going to have 6 points," Jordan Spice says when it's over one day.
Of course, the European elections are still 12 and 4 points, and they are outstanding.
As Spice says, the U.S. election is a follow-up, and one day it's playing together, and it's a good reason that everyone has three points of experience and Justin Thomas.
Spices, from Tee to Greene, are unforgivably attacked and left with visual effects.
He and Thomas were two-pointed after two o'clock, but the blessings of London's progress increased, and they joined the 4th test.
When he won the party at the 15th hall, he was also aware of his belief that the U.S. election team had not yet lost.
"You have to focus on your trial and do your best."
Now these players are trying to leave each other.
I'll win 18 halls.
In this two-day period, the players who raise more points than Space and Thomas are only French Morinary and Tommy Freewood, who are the biggest topic in the radar.
These two European elections should be held by changers, and they won four in the 4th battle.
These two, called Moriwood, were not the only ones who didn't hit the bogie in the afternoon session, but they avoided the bogie in the afternoon, in the afternoon, in the afternoon, and in the afternoon, in the afternoon.
In addition to this kind of experimentation, when you see two energy flows between the various groups, it becomes clear that they should be the players that will fall by day, and that no more than Freewood and Morinary players will be able to win the European elections at the end of the L.G. National War.
They both want to do it in another hall at the same time.
However, the European elections have not yet been decided.
Baba Watson and Web Simpson just won the football hero, Sergio Garcia and Alex Noren this morning.
Galsia and Lennon couldn't go back after they found the grave through bogies and two double bogs in the first half of the nine halls.
I don't have any friends to help you.
Forball and Forsam are very much interested in the exchange of two people on each page, the advice they're making with their advice, and the change in the times of the war.
The European elections are far better than the team, and they are leading a great deal towards the end of the day, but in this forum, the US elections have shown a desire to combat the insecurity of the American side, especially.
The last day of the Leader Cup, Europe's election is 10-6.
The European elections have led the US to the election at 10-6 and lead to the final day of leadership.
Tommy Freewood and Frankesco Morinary, who showed wonderful lives, won two battles against the tough Tiger Wes, and so far raised the score of L Golf Nationals at 4 points.
Two years ago, Thomas Bion, a European state election that witnessed the loss of Trophi in Heiseltin, managed the U.S. election in the morning, and called it 3-1.
The U.S. elections were re-connaissanced in the forum and won two trials, but it was not possible to make a difference.
To maintain the trophie, the American choice, Jim Forrick, needs to get 8 points on Sunday’s 12th symphony test.
Freightwood was not only the first European lockey to raise 4 points, but it was the second time in the history of the Leader Cup in the 4th round of the first battle that was called the "Moliwood" after a sensory weekend.
After wes and Patrick Reed were released on the football team, they won a five-and-a-a-half-year-old score in a score of five-and-a-half-a-half.
In the second round of Saturday's trials, we've also seen a good time play, but we've not only lost in the 29 rounds of football and forums, but also eaten seven rounds.
In the morning football, Justin Ross, who took his break, joined Henry Stanson in the forum, and struck down 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka in World Bank 1 and 3.
The course in the West of Paris has been a good day, but the European elections have not been governed by thought.
Three-time Prime Minister Jordan Spice and Justin Thomas showed the criteria for the US elections on Saturday.
After they won John Ram and Ian Porter in Spain on a football match, they lost the first two halls in the forum, but then they won in 4&3 in Porter and Lori McRoy.
In the history of the Leader Cup, there are no cases in the past that changed from 4 points to four points in the syngloss, but the U.S. elections can only hold a trophi when it comes to separating itself.
But for the two-day American elections, which seem to be more than their ability to fight on Sunday, it seems.
North Korea says it's absolutely impossible to give up arms without trust.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said that on Saturday, the United States was strengthened by the continued sanctions and that it should not give up nuclear weapons on the other side under such circumstances.
In the United States last year, Li-Yonho said that North Korea had taken a "important good-will approach" over the past year, such as the cessation of verification tests and the cessation of missile bombings, the detonation of verifications, the dispersion of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But, you can't see enough reactions from the United States," he said.
"If we can't trust the United States, our national security security confidence will be lost, and we will not be armed to one another under such circumstances."
The House of Commons has repeated the frustrations of North Korea that the US Government has no reward for the "steps of the "non-nuclear" process in North Korea, but his statement is significant that the North Korean Government has not immediately rejected one-sided non-nuclearization.
In a conversation with the US President of Singapore on 12 June with the first head of the North Korean leadership, he promised that he would take it to the "non-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula", and Tranp made a joint declaration that he promised security in North Korea.
North Korea seeks a formal end to the Korean war of 1950–53, but the United States states that North Korea needs to abandon nuclear weapons first.
The U.S. Government has also opposed the call to combat severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States has claimed 'non-nuclear' and has put greater pressure on sanctions in order to achieve a strong goal, against 'the end of the war'."
"The realization that we can be punished by sanctions is the fantasy of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that our mistrust is being strengthened by continued sanctions. "
President Tranp's ex-Presidents stressed this week's first week, and he did not mention the plan for two meetings of the brains of King and Tranp.
Instead, he stressed three times a meeting with President Mun Jain of the Republic of Korea in the last five months, and added: "If non-nuclear issues were not United States, the non-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been there."
However, it's quite different when it was said that the rockets in North Korea didn't prevent them from reaching the U.S. territory after Tranquus called it "the bad president", after Tranp called it "the Rocketman" in a self-exploited war.
In the United States this year, the trauma that threatened North Korea to "completely destroy" last year claimed that there was a lot of problems, and North Korea had to maintain sanctions until it was denuclearized.
"Tranp is not going to be two years, three years or five months. "
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should pay for its measures in North Korea.
However, U.S. Chief of State of Mike Pompeo said in the U.S. Security Council on Thursday: "The security sanctions must continue very hard until they prove that complete non-nuclearization has been carried out."
Security has been strengthening the sanctions against North Korea in a consistent manner to cut off funds for the development of nuclear-weapon-free missiles in North Korea since 2006.
Pompeo had a conversation with outsiders during the U.S., and then said he was going to visit the next month to be ready for the two brains.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit has not resulted.
He reported that he had made progress after the fall in July, but in a few hours North Korea has accused him of saying "demanding like a gang."
North Korea promised to clear the missile and nuclear facilities if the United States had adopted the "appropriate approach" this month in a meeting with the President of the United States.
He says that the "activation" he wants is security promised by Tranp in Singapore, and he told him that he was moving towards normalization of his relationship with the American government.
The Harvard student was given the course to get enough rest.
In this year's new course at Harvard University, it's meant that all school students will get more sleepy so that they can take caffeine and fight against the macho culture that they're studying in "Ollnet".
Students at Harvard University in the world often don't know about the very basic thing that was a way to have a body.
Charles Tussler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard University, also a specialist at the Briggam And Wimens Hospital, designed this course.
He was thinking about starting this course after talking about the effects of sleeplessness on learning.
"And the last thing one of the girls came to me, why would I want to hear this story when I was four?"
I was surprised that no one had told her the importance of sleeping."
In the course that was first performed this year, it explains to the students how good sleep habits encourage learning and mobility and how to lead to general walbying.
Paul Barreira, a professor of mental medicine at Harvard University, and the director of medical services at the university, says that after his university realized a serious lack of sleep during that week, he decided to introduce the course.
In one hour course, we'll have a joint chat task.
In one section, students can learn about the importance of sleep-related days when they click on the book when they click on the book, the caffeine and the light, the effects of sleepless motion, and the importance of sleep.
In another section, it explains to participants how long-term sleep deprivation can occur, whether it is possible to develop the heart, the brain, and the cancer risk.
Also, on the map of Campas shared by the chat-type icons, it encourages participants to think about the agenda.
"I know that students' actions need to change quickly.
But they should have the right to know, as well as the right to know how smoking can affect their health.
And there is still a culture that promotes "night's study", and it says that the growth of modern technology and press for students increases sleeplessness.
It's the "secret weapon" of the student who struggles with stress, fatigue and insecurity, and he says that it's not enough to sleep your brains in cold mode, and that it's always going to prevent physical growth.
Raymond Soo (19 years old) from California, who studied chemistry and physics, supported his course after receiving a class at Harvard University last year.
He woke up by that course and thought he wanted to expand the course for the entire campus.
The next step he wants to take before all college students start studying at a hot spot called Harvard.
Professor Twisler suggests setting up alarms for students at the same time of bedtime as well as using electronic screens and LED lighting and paying attention to the harmful "Bloods" that interferes with sleep problems.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Ranges: Menga's gorillas are going to drop the rangers with a gerard rate.
The Rangers also ate the North in Hawaii, and by the Dry Manga gorge in Livingstone, the missing rangs in Steven Jerard's pocket were over 1-0.
Lengers, who founded the Abbloks, had been watching the first Avey win since the 4-1 victory in St. Johnton in February.
Menga raised the gorl seven minutes ago, but then he didn't see the missing ranges of inspiration hit the match.
The Rangers are now down to six, but Livingstone is up to three times the Hybernian.
Also, because the Colom Spence of the trial had to be thrown out of the Awey's guest and be treated with injuries to the head, it is possible to face more cables in the Ranges.
Gerard came to this trial when he broke the air and made eight members of the Betfred Cap's decision.
On the other hand, Holt kept his point from the previous week's hard work, and he'll be happy to have a well-trained member of the team suffered in all respects.
The Rangers won the total, but Livingstone attacked more effectively than a few positions.
Just after the start of two years, Scott Pittman from Midfield's first pass in Manga, but he'll avoid a decisive chance outside of Side.
Then, the head of the frikick in Kigan Jacobs' Pentalteria was taken by Craig Harket, and Alan Risgore was shot at the difender, but only in the backpost.
The Rangers managed the ball, but the finals were not a reliable play, but started to play on the hope-based perspective.
Alfred Moreros of the Colombians claimed Penarty when he had more than 15 minutes with Stephen Lorez, but Judge Stephen Tomson rejected the appeal of Moreros.
The Rangers released 2 of the original half-year-old shirt, but the GKriam Kelly of the Rangers used the same simple hat as the Lasana Crivary and Ovie Egeria.
The pre-34th priority of Livingstone was against the flow of temptation, but no one can deny that it is a hardware gift.
This is where Rangers couldn't cope with Jacobs' setpes in Penaltyria.
Deklan Garagar passed Scott Robinson, and Robinson sent him a pass to the calm, and he made it easy for Menga to settle the goal, but Scott Afield couldn't handle it.
Gelder will transfer Ryan Kent to Haftime, but this works quickly, and Winger's Clibary will send a pass to Moreros, but Kelly blocked the ball in good shape before the Gourlin.
But Livingstone actually ran the long ball that Risgor and Harket sent next.
In the end, there was a chance that Livingstone would be able to extend the lead, but Jacob's hat was blocked by the Macreger's Good Sieve, and then hedgings from the Conner also went to the side.
Gran Medulton of Rangers, who was on the way out, called on Penarty when he contacted Jacobs, but this is where Tomson turned it off.
Almanak: Founder of the gay counter
One page of "Sande Moning" Almanak: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Vilhelm was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting radiation and testing the device that was finally known as the guitar counter.
Since then, the gay Counter of Science has also become the head of pop-calchor as seen in the 1950 film "Cronade's Hour" of Roy Rogers and Dell Evans, who had never seen it before.
The man said, "What is that body?"
Rogers: "It's a guitar counter that's used to detect radioactive material like uranium.
As we move on, we can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by the radiation in the atoms."
Evans says, "That's true.
Hans Giiger died just a few days before his 63-year-old birthday in 1945.
But the discovery of his name is still alive.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "judge" the wrong cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to kill bad cells.
The vaccine teaches us to recognize the bad genes in the immune system as part of the treatment.
In this way, I'm going to take the immunization cells out of the patients and add them to the lab.
This allows cells to be able to "judge" the substance common to many cancers and to re-insert it.
Test vaccines show promising results among cancer patients across the range.
In the case of a woman who was given vaccine to teach the immune system to identify the wrong cells, cancer was eliminated for more than 18 months.
In this way, by removing the immunization cells from the patient and by adding changes to the test room, you can "judge" the substance common to many cancers called HER2, and then insert it again.
Professor Jay Belzfsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Beseda, Maryland, said: "The effectiveness of vaccines has been demonstrated as a result of us."
HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancers, including cancer, cancer, cancer, and cancer.
Similar applications, such as the use of immunization cells from patients and the use of cancer cells, also have an effect on the treatment of a type of white blood cell.
The Canyon West has been able to use the MAGA cap in SNL and support the tramp.
It's a bad idea.
Kenya West won the support of the detached Donald Tranp president at the SNL show and said he would fight in 2020.
The West, after singing the "Gost Town" "Meek America Great Agen" cap that night, re-enacted violence against the Democratic Party and repeatedly supported the tramp.
And I said to the white man, "How do you like the tramp, and he's a racist?"
But if I had remembered the difference between mankind and America, I'd've always been behind America."
This day's SNL began with a film by Matt Dimon in Hollywood, who published the testimony of the Supreme Court of Justice at the Board of Justice of the Supreme Court on sexual violence against Christine Breeze Ford.
The West's violent video was not exposed, but it was uploaded to the social media by the comedian Chris Locke.
I don't know if Locke was trying to laugh at West in that post.
And West was also upset that he had suffered in the stage for his hat.
"The backstage started with them.
They say, "Don't go out as far as you can."
It really started!
And "Wasington Egzaminer," he says.
West went on to say, "What do you want to see?"
Then try love."
At his comment, at least two of his audiences appeared, and the SNL's performers seemed confused, and one of them said, "The whole stadium came back quietly."
West was invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, who died a few days ago, Mac Miller of the rapper.
West put on Periebott's clothes and made a lot of people laugh at the "Ai-Lab-Itt."
The leader of the group TPUSA, Candice Turner, tweeted the West as follows: "Thank you for the bravest spirit: stand up against the rebels."
But Karen Hunter, the director of Tukshaw, tweeted that the West was just "they're very beautiful."
"But I chose not to pay people to spread harmful ideology in my community (by buying his music and clothing and by supporting his art).
He's free.
"We are." She added.
Before the program, Lapper announced that he had changed his name on Twitter, and now he said, "People officially known as the Canyon West."
He's not the first artist he's ever known, but he's been following Didi, also known as Paudadi, Pafi and Pidi.
The partner rapper, Snoop Doug has a name called Snoop Rayon, and of course, the tradition Prince of Music changed the symbol, and then changed it to "the artist known as the Prince."
There's no doubt about the murder in Belfast restaurant.
On Friday, a man was shot in a restaurant in East Belfast, and a 45-year-old man was charged with an innocent crime.
The police are reporting that this incident occurred in Barikhakamoa.
On Monday, the defendant is scheduled to appear at the Belfast Court of Justice.
The report is being investigated by the investigation team.
The Star of Game O'Sloans, Kit Harlinton, attacked a man with a virus.
Kit Harlinton is known as John Snou, who is known for his violent HBO's violent middle-class game of the game of Sloans.
But 31-year-old Kitt attacked a stereotype of this kind of macheo hero and said that this kind of work of the screen made young people feel that they must be strong enough to be respetted around.
When Kitt spoke to Sande Times Calcher, he said, "Something's wrong," he asked how to deal with the problem of violent men in the MeToo era.
Kitt, who recently married Rose Resley, a co-player in the game of O'Sloans, admitted that he feels "very strong" about dealing with this problem.
"Now we feel very personally strong about what we're wrong about men."
"What have we been teaching young people about the problems we are seeing today?"
Kitt thinks that because of a very male caractor, there's an increase in male violence, some of its responsibility might be on television.
He goes on to say, "What's what you've been taught about birth?
Don't young people feel that they must be a man with certain assets because of what they've seen on TV and on the street?
I think this is one of the major problems in our time, but how can I change this?
When you see a young man, it's obvious that something's wrong."
In the interview, he also said, "The battlefield and horses are better," and he admitted that after the game was finished in the summer of next year, there would be no more pre-ordainment and follow-up talks.
Since November, it's the story of a brother who's got his hands on film promoters and thieves.
He's saying he's the best that I've ever met in the game of O'Sloans.
"Because I met my wife in this program, that means I gave my future family and life from here."
Rose played a friendly gratuit of John Snou, who played kit in this fantasy that he was in charge of Amy.
In June 2018, two of them worked as a producer in Resley, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: Reporting that 14% of new diseases have increased rapidly in China
China reported that the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 82,000 people are affected in their home country.
In 2018, only about 40,000 new cases were reported during the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted through sexual intercourse, and there have been changes in the past.
In ancient China, HIV spread rapidly in some areas as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But in this way, the number of people infected with HIV has been reduced to almost zero, and the health authorities of China are informed at a meeting in Hong Kong.
But in China, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS is increasing by 100,000 more than last year.
In the LGBT community of China, HIV infection is becoming a serious problem.
In China, sex was legalized in 1997, but the difference between LGBT and LGBT people is said to be overwhelming.
According to the survey, the country's conservative value estimates that 70% of homosexuals eventually marry women.
Many infections occur to prevent this relationship from being prepared.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised that it will be able to access HIV more widely as a part of the solution to this problem.
It's hard to deny the loss of the data of the House of Commons based on Staff, that it's a dangerous lie, a fraud.
Ms. Maxine Walters of the U.S. House of Lords denied her announcement that one of her staff on Saturday that she had written personal information to the House of Commons on the Wikipedia page of the House of Commons.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party claims that this claim is being made by critics and websites of the "survivor".
"Fuck, lie, stupid lies," Walters said on Twitter.
The information that has been published has been reported to include their own housing and telephone number, with Prime Minister Linzi Graham of the elected state of South Carolina, and members of the U.S. election, Mike Lee and Olyn Hatch of the House of Lords.
This information was posted online by prominent people in Capitol Hill, among the Supreme Court's public hearings on the sexual suspicions of the Supreme Court of Justice of Britt Cabano.
This data breach occurred after the three senior members of the House of Commons asked Cabano.
A secure site such as the Gateway Pandite and RedState is a printer's office of IP address, and it's reported that he's published the information of Walters' employees.
"This unfounded claim is absolutely false and absolutely false." Walters continued.
"My staff has been injured by such false claims of identity, personal information and security, but they have nothing to do with the lack of this information.
It's a complete lie and absolutely a lie. "
Walters' statement was criticised online by people who included the White House reporter Ali Fricher.
"This denial is not just anger."
"This showed that she was not responding to the House.
If you were told you didn't do what you didn't do, don't be angry.
Don't be proud.
Don't ask the defendant's motive.
You have to walk slowly and slowly."
Friesher seems to be comparing the criticism of the Democratic Party's reaction to Waters, who said that it was too angry about the attitude of the Cabano judge at the Friday press conference.
In the mid-election, Omar Nabaro also expressed his opinion on Twitter at the joint party's invitation to attend the Waters Conference.
"That's really great."
In her statement, Walters says that her office has "founded such a false claim to the authorities and the police."
She says, "We will do our best to prove the offender," and she says, "and the offender will be liable to the law for his destructive and dangerous actions on my staff."
"Johny English, Analog's Reconnaissance" film.
Recently, it is decided to see the significance of the budget in a new film depicting the fall of Britain, but it also seems to apply to Johnny English's continued editing comedy.
We've got some sort of impossible themes, and this body's own winding up is going to be a new chance of England's export?
In any case, Johny English, whose face is as weak as his eyes and eyes, like rubber, is repeated in this work, shows that his name is a comedy made for lovers other than English.
Of course, he's a stupid cycrete agent who realized that he's going to have his trained charms, but he's got all the elements of the character playing only one of the songs of the London Olympics in 2012 at the opening of London Olympics.
Johnny English is also based on a television broadcast by the forgotten Barclaycard, which has yet to be delivered by Atkinson, where there is a global tour.
There's one or two good things to do in this latest work.
When Johnny England approaches the helicopter, it's good to see a lot of places where Robert Robert would put his voice in the Helmet.
The power of comedians who have captured Atkinson's body is also released, but especially when we think that the "real" film, such as mission inputs, is going to include comedian elements, it's a very weak and enormous feeling.
The Uumora feels like it's not adults, and for me, the strange adventure of Johnny English is not as unique as the comic film in Atkinson, which seems to be not so unique, and it doesn't seem to have a focus.
In this film, the present permanent subject of the UK has a serious problem.
The cyberhacker's involvement in the UK's top-secretage web network revealed the identity of all British agents in the activity, and the most important agent (the least sadly in Kevin Elton) is blind.
With many problems already in place, the news was too limited for the honourable prime minister who had already fallen in support, and Emma Thompson was not able to go to the theater for the better performance of this terrace May's paradise.
Her wise advisor must gather the spies who have withdrawn because all of the current spies have been published.
That's why I'm working as a senior school teacher, and I'm glad I'm with Johnny English, who's teaching me how to be a secret employee.
English is going to the White Hole for emergency briefings, and it's going back to Ben Miller, a long-grandfather who's been suffering for years.
Boff is now married to the commander of the submarine, who is well-zealed, and is married to Vicki Pepardin.
And there will be a resurrection of the Conbies of the Queen's Siclette Service, and a beautiful fem Fatar of Olga Cullenco, the office Britour.
On the other hand, the Prime Minister is still saying that millions of seniors, who claim to be able to solve the problems of British computers, will be able to solve them.
The English and the Buff are going to blow up a number of cables like before.
Of course, all the work is being done on the last mountain, but this favorite satellite comedy is like a whole child-to-child program.
It's very fair.
And as I felt in other Johny English films, the English film industry couldn't imagine that it would not be able to play a corresponding role for Rowan Atkinson.
The working party denied that it was working for the people on the 4th day of the week and that it was investigating a five-day plan to pay for the people.
Jeremy Covin's working party is like examining a five-day radical plan for the people to pay for their work on the 4th day of the week.
The partners want to share with employees in order to increase their share of the funds they have received through the business of human science (AI) revolution.
This plan shows that employees will receive the same allowance, but they will work for three days a week.
Information reports say this idea is in line with the economic and plan of the party to make it a country that will benefit workers.
Moving to the system for 4 days a week is also a way for employers to benefit from the changing economy and also from the Labour Union.
The labour force in the Sande Times says: "The policy is being made public by the end of the year.
"It is not possible to do so in one night, but the four-day working system is a goal that is consistent with the Party's implementation and the entire economic strategy of the Party that will re-establish the economy so as to benefit the workers."
Because the Red Party has sworn a working system for four days in the 2017 election campaign, the working party does not support this idea at first.
However, it is not the entire working party that is currently supporting its goal.
Spooksman of the Labour Party said, "The working system is not the party's direction, but the party's not examining it."
The Prime Minister of the film, John McDonald, specified the vision of the socialist revolution in the economy during the working session last week.
Mr. McDonald said that he was determined to withdraw power from the "non-smoker" of the public business company and the "unskilled" company.
The Prime Minister's plan for the film may be "control" because the government of the working party has recognized the wrong conduct, and it may also mean that the current president of the water company may not be able to recover all the shares.
He also introduced employees to the corporate employment agency, which included the creation of a sovereign fund and the creation of 10% of the capital of civil enterprises, and confirmed the plan to receive annual contributions of up to 500 pounds.
I'm going to tell you if the FBI is able to change their views on Cabanos by saying, "60 mints."
The FBI's investigation into the charge of Judge Bret Cabanno revealed that the final vote on the nomination to the Supreme Court had been delayed for at least one week and that the results of the joint investigation threatened the support of the House of Commons.
In an interview delivered on Sunday, Scott Perry, a 60-minute member of the party, asked whether the FBI could find something to change the mind of the House of Commons, the House of Commons, the House of Lords, the House of Lords, the House of Commons, the House of Lords, the House of Lords, the House of Lords, the House of Lords and the House of Lords, and John Kennedy.
Kennedy was even more open than the grammar of South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said I was going to the public hearing, and I said I spoke to Judge Cabano.
So I called him and said, "Did you do it?"
He was firm and determined, and understood."
But it's impossible to change the vote on the gram.
"I'm going to make a decision about Bret Cabano, and it's going to be a terrible crime."
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's happened, but I know it's what Brett strongly denied.
"and no one she named could prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I can't see a new change."
What's with the Global City Festival? Did it help to reduce poverty?
Today's Saturday, in New York, the annual music event, the Global City Festival, is being launched. There are a lot of impressive stars here, but it's also an impressive mission to end the world's poverty.
In the Global City Festival this year, thousands of people gather to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, not only of Janet Jackson, CardieB, and Sean Mendez, but also of the fact that they will end extreme poverty by the year 2030.
The Global City Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, which is the international body that wants to end poverty by increasing the number of people who fight effectively.
In order to receive the free ticket of the event (unless you want to buy the VIP ticket), the concert participants had to complete their work on a voluntary basis, send a call to the world's leaders, or do something meaningful to raise awareness of the other way that poverty would end.
But after 12 years, how far did Global City Festival achieve its goal?
Is the idea that you're going to call people to act for free concerts is valid, or is it just a sense to sign up for online requests, or to make tweets?
Since 2011, Global City has reported more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters and has promoted various goals.
This action will have an impact on the lives of over $370 billion on world leaders, which will affect the lives of more than 225 million people by 2030.
In the beginning of 2018, the group drew attention to 390 committees and statements from the action, with at least $100 million already paid or funded.
The co-group finds that the secured funds have directly affected about 649 million people in the world.
In the main committee, the committee is a committee that will help children grow up to the greatest extent, and it will include a party of investors and employers who will focus on England.
"The Government of England, the rich, the governments, and the like of you can provide social injustice, which is lack of food."In a life concert in London in April 2018, Ambassador of Power's Trinity, Tracy Ulman told visitors.
The Co-Group also stated that more than 5,000 women and children in England had acted in an effort to improve their mother and children's nutrition, and the Government had announced funding assistance for the power-building project to support women and children.
"Do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Shitson said, "It's going to be a long way, and sometimes it's going to fail.
But when we get together, we have power, and we'll succeed as a great civil authority and anti-parate Haiti movement.
Janet Jackson, Wikkend, Shawn Mendez, CardieB, and Janel Monae are the organizers of an event launched in New York this year, and the host serves Deborah=Le Fennes and Huu Jackman.
The U.S. can use the marine army to block the energy output from Russia.
The U.S. government can rely on marines in the region of the Middle East to prevent Russia's energy from being attacked on the market, and Ryan Jinkmi's deputy officer revealed that Washington Egzaminer reported.
Mr. Jink claimed that the involvement of Russia's Syrian interests in the recruitment of a particularly legitimate government is the reason for opening up a new energy market.
"The reason they are in the Middle East is because they think they want to share energy in the same way as Eastern Europe and southern Europe."
According to the staff, there are ways and means to handle it.
He said, "The United States and the Navy are able to make sure that Sierra Leone is open and, as necessary, can block energy from entering the market."
Mr. Jink was discussing the status of the U.S. "Energy Consumers' Voice" as a non-profit organization, and the Consumer Energy Alliance was talking to an event that was dominated by the Consumer Energy Alliance.
He pointed out that both companies are actually the same as Washington's application to deal with Russia and Iran.
"The economic choices for Iran and Russia are few," he said, and he said, "the economical choices for Iran and Russia are to replace them with fuel."
As a safe option for European consumers instead of Russia, the Tranp regime has issued a statement in which it is a mission to promote the export of natural gas to Europe.
For this reason, Tranp's authorities, including President Tranp himself, are trying to explain Germany to get out of the "Norde Stream2 pipeline plan."
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipilline, which is expected to expand the existing pipeline content twice a billion feet [2.100 billion m], is a purely economic project.
Cremlin claims that Washington's strong reaction to this project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the idea that energy cannot be a means of reducing pressure, and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers.
The U.S. Stans called for Germany's return, and Germany reaffirmed the committee's commitment to the project.
The German Federation (BDI), the main industry group in Germany, asked the United States not to vote for EU energy policy and Berlin and for the two national agreements in Moscow.
"The third country is a major problem that interferes with our energy supply," said the President of the German Industry Union (BDI), Dieter Kemp, following a recent meeting between German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Russian President Uragimil Putin.
Elizabeth Wallen is going to say, "I'm going to look closely at the election of the President of 2020," and the President of the House of Commons of Massachusetts says.
Elizabeth Wallen, President of the House of Commons of Massachusetts, said on Tuesday, the president's election after the election will be "examined closely".
In the city hall of Hol York, Massachusetts, Mr. Wallen confirmed that he was investigating the situation.
According to Mr. Hill, "the time came when a woman entered Washington and stood up to the corrupt government, including her standing on top."
"Since 6 months, I've been trying to look closely at the presidential election.
Mr. Wallen added to the debate about President Donald Tranp among the Town Hall, saying, "He led this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about Donald Tranp's progress towards democracy," she said.
Mr. Wallen, Mr. Tranp and the deputy judge of the Supreme Court, whom he has appointed, have been criticized by Mr. Bret Kavano.
On Tuesday's Twitter, Mr. Wallen said, "There must be a FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a global survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Wallen's elected districts did not think she would stand for 2020.
According to a study by the Political Research Center/Bostongrove World University, 58 per cent of the highest possible "Massachusese state authority, the House of Lords should not wait.
32% supported the stand.
In a global survey, 38 per cent of those who support the stand-up of the Deval Patrick, who have supported the possibility of standing up, and 48 per cent have opposed.
As the name of the former Vice-President Joe Bieden and Prime Minister Bernie Sanders, who are also being discussed on the possibility of standing in 2020.
According to the AP communication, the video says it's going to be officially decided by January.
Sarah Parin spoke at the Donald Tranp meeting at the PTSD in Paris.
26-year-old Trak Parin spent a year in Iraq after he joined the army in September.
He was arrested on the night of Monday night in the Domestic Biolence case.
"What my son is experiencing, what he is experiencing, and what he is experiencing, is that I feel the bad effects of PTSD and the damage the soldiers suffer when they return." She spoke to the audience at the Donald Tranp meeting in Talsa, Oklahoma.
Parin called his arrest "in the picture of the room," and about his son and other war-reserved soldiers, "they're going back a little bit.
According to Dan Bennet of the Police Department, he was arrested on Sunday in Alaska, and arrested and charged with Domestic Biolence and the possession of weapons at the time of the attack and was charged with Domestik Biolence against women.
18 states and Washington D.C. support for the opposition to the new refugee policy.
18 states and Colombia's special districts support a legal objection to the new US policy to refuse the death of victims fleeing from gangs and domestiques.
According to the NBC News, 18 representatives of the state and the special district have submitted a bill in Washington on Friday, and they have supported a protest against refugee hopes' policies.
Grace, the session's complaint was made by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union in August for federal policy, but the complaint's reputation is unclear.
She said that her partner and his violent gang members abused her, but the US authorities refused to apply for asylum on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
State attorneys who support Grace explained that El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala are facing a wide range of gangs and domestic biolences and that most refugees are applying to the United States.
The new U.S. refugee policy covered the decision of the 2014 Migration Court of Appeal that allowed migrants who fled from Domestic Bayes to apply for their lives without writing.
Colonbia Special Justice President Carl Rashin stated in his statement on Friday that the new policy is "not ignoring international law for decades that has continued to exist."
"The federal law requires that all requests for refugees be determined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the request, and such hardware is contrary to its principle," says the Court's advisory report.
While the presidents in the report say that immigrants are more likely to become workers, "give the necessary work," their policies reject their entry into the United States are damaging the economy.
The Chief Justice of the Jeff Sessions ordered in June that victims who escaped the violence of Domestic Biolence and Gang should not be given protection to the national prosecutors.
"Death can be used by people who leave their country for persecution or fear because of persecution, persecution, religion, nationality, or political group of certain social groups," said Mr. Sesions in a June 11 policy statement.
Death is not all the problems that people in the world face every day, even the most serious problems, but it is not intended to reduce them.
In the struggle for survival, the number of deaths is growing in desperate rescue activities.
For the survivors, the situation was sad.
"It seems very tense," said Lisa Xsma, a 35-year-old mother.
"The ambulance's driving people for a few minutes.
There's almost no clean water."
They returned to the destroyed house and found the people who were trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people hated me, and the hospital that was damaged by Magnitwood 7.5 earthquakes became a human drink.
Among the victims who had been beaten by Douay Harris, who had been beaten and beaten, were those who had stayed outside of Pauls Armey Hospital, but where patients were treated outside because of the constant tragedy.
When I remembered when the room in the five rooms of the hotel with my wife and daughter was hit by a violent earthquake, his eyes were filled with tears.
"There was no time to flee.
I thought I was stuck in a broken wall, and I thought, "Haris spoke to AP, and the family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then I couldn't hear anything.
I don't know what happened to her and the kids.
I wish it was all right."
Ambassador of the United States, accused of using China's "initiation" propaganda.
A week after China's official newspaper in the United States published a 4-page notice announcing the intersessional interests of Central America, China's US Ambassador accused Beijing of using the US newspaper for propaganda.
President Donald Tranp, President of the United States, denied last week's water strike, but China was accused of attempting China's presidential elections on 6 November, and then told the newspaper of China's largest Demoine Register newspaper in Iowa.
The claim that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US elections was that the American authorities are in China by Washington, as the U.S. government told Reuters.
The promotion of promotional propaganda is common to foreign governments, but Beijing and Washington are now among the most lucrative wars that are at the forefront of the growing competition for mutual inputs.
China's recovery tax in the early part of the Cold War was designed to support a community party that supported a tramp rate, such as Iowa, to attack exporting producers in the state, and Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Bransted, an American Ambassador to China, who had long been familiar with the knowledge of the state of Iowa, which was the main exporter of agricultural products in China in the past, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstadt of China wrote in his opinion column on Sunday's Demoin Registries: "I am increasing the intensity of the propaganda campaign against freedom of the country."
According to Bransted, "the Chinese Government is using the freedom and freedom of speech, which is a major tradition of America, for its own benefit, to publish propaganda to spread the propaganda."
"On the other hand, in Beijing's new state of road, there is no limited objection to the fact that China's people have a different view of the mixed economic routes in China. Media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party."
And one of China's most famous newspapers added, "It's not my article to be downloaded," but it's not exactly what newspapers are talking about.
And by the movement of Mr. Cabaner, the analyst warned that women's rights were being left before the middle elections.
In the case of multiple witnesses of sexual violence, many of the social parties are protecting Mr. Bret Cabaner, a deputy of the Supreme Court of Justice.
This move has been very intense, and most of the members of the community are already looking forward to voting.
In an article in Sa Hill, published on Saturday, Professor Grant Leeler of the Ministry of Political Science at the University of Raquez, said: "It's impossible to verify the facts of the past."
Professor Reyler said that the President of the House of Commons, Mr. Jeff Frack (electing the Common Party of Arizona), had promoted an investigation by the FBI in Greece, but that it was doubtful whether the voter would be angry.
According to the Washington DC newspaper, the Chinese Advisor and National Spokesperson of the Moboon, a group of progressive civilizations, said, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they be forgotten tomorrow. This will be remembered until November."
On Friday morning, the Communist Party of the Commission of Justice, despite the testimony of Dr. Christian Brassley Ford, had chosen to continue the nomination of Mr. Cabaner, a demonstration in front of the House, called: "We are coming in November!"
The political analysts outside the party, Steve Rozenberg, said that "the zeal and motivation of the Democratic Party will be unknown to the news site."
"That's the sound that's always been, but that's the way.
But this is also more likely. In particular, female voters from the state-owned parties in the city and young voters from 18 to 29 years of age do not have a good opinion of the President, but the voting rate is probably very low."
Before the public testimony that Mr. Ford had been subjected to sexual abuse on the reputation of the Supreme Court judge, he indicated that there would be a return if the joint party continued its approval.
According to the NBC News, the president of the National Council of the Communist Party, Michael Sutter said last week, "this movement is causing serious disturbance in the GOP."
Mr. Guy Cecil of the Democratic Party's electoral support team is in the newschannel, "the issue is not just the final vote of the committee or the final vote to decide whether or not Mr. Cabaner is appointed.
However, the Americans are divided by which Mr. Ford and Mr. Cabaner's testimony, which seems to be a majority.
According to the Ugawa World Survey, 41% responded that Mr. Ford's testimony is absolutely/distributed, and he was 35%.
In addition, 38% replied that Mr. Cabaner was lying too many/performingly, and it was 30% about Mr. Ford.
Because of Mr. Frank's behind arrest, the FBI is starting to investigate Mr. Ford's testimony and another reporter, Mr. Debora Ramilletz, and the Guardian newspaper reports that he's starting to investigate the evidence.
Mr. Ford also testified that he had been abused by Mr. Cabaner, who had been drinking alcohol at the age of 17, before the Supreme Court.
Mr. Ramillets also testified that the appointed judge of the Supreme Court, who lived at Erle University in the 1980s, had exposed the sex instrument when he participated in the party.
World Wide Web Developers, Google and Facebook are planning new Internet initiatives.
The World Wide Web developer, Tim Burner Lee, has set up a start-up business to become a Facebook, Amazon, and Google's libel.
Inrupt is the latest project by Mr. Lee, a member of the technology community, which is based on the open-source platform form "Solid".
Solid gives the user a choice where data is stored and which information can be accessed.
In a private interview with Fast, Mr. Burner Lee left Jack, the intention of Inrupt's hidden purpose is to "world control."
It's about starting up and saying, "This should be done right now."
"This is a historic moment."
This application uses Solid's technology and allows you to create your own personal online database.
This includes contact lists, to-dolists, calendars, music libraries, other personnel and professional tools.
This can be used from a browser, like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack,Spotify.
As a private online datastore unit, it is suggested that anyone can access any information that is completely user-friendly.
Inrupt calls it "the personal envelope of data passed."
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, Inrupt, the idea of Inrupt is to provide a resource, a process and a suitable sculpture so that anyone can use Solid.
Inrupt is currently composed of Mr. Burner Lee, Mr. Bruce, the safety platform for IBM, the developer of Ontaf's project, and the Coordinating Community of Volunteers.
From this week onwards, technology developers in the world can make their distribution applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Mr. Burner Lee and his team are talking about the introduction of a complete change in how Facebook and Google's business models are going to get stuck in one night."
"I'm not asking them for permission."
In a press release on Saturday, Mr. Burner Lee said about Inrupt, "Mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to ensure the stability and quality of the new website built on Solid."
Mr. Burners Reese established World Wide Web Consortium at the University of Massachusetts in 1994 and made changes to the Internet.
Mr. Burner Lee continues to voice a statement that has had an impact on the network's neutrality over the past few months.
Mr. Burner Lee is still in the position of the Inrupt, as well as the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, the founder and director of the Opendetention Institute.
"I'm very excited about this generation's web."
Bernard Van: The celebration of the First World War, called the Holy Fathers of the Pope's First World War, is being held
As a warrior, he received a Victorian cross-sectional chapter in the first world war, the only Catholic Church in England, and the blessed city where he was 100 years old.
Professor Bernard Van had a stroke on September 29, 1918, due to the battle of Belgris and Luke.
But they didn't know that he was killed by the Sniper four days later and that he was famous for being the greatest glory in the British army.
On Saturday, a parade was held in Lashden, Nosantopshire, and a monument was opened by two of his descendants.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that he was a "very symbolic" about the stone, and that he had been publicly beaten for 100 years by his grandfather.
According to London Gazet, on September 29, 1918, Van had a large army, and the canals of San=Cantan were hit by a fire from the front line and from the machine gun.
Then, with the "great bravery" on the front line of the gun, he raced on his hand with a small gun, pushed back the front line and shot three troops.
Van Middles was killed on October 4, 1918, by a German spy who was about to end the war in a month.
And 72-year-old Michael Van says about his father's actions, "I can't really like it, but it's embarrassing."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, celebrated a great celebration after a paradise that had been founded on the dawnwood Royal Youth band.
Mr. Michael Van said, "I felt very proud to be in Paradise." And he added, "The courage of real hero has been demonstrated with the support of many people."
The MMAfan night to see Belator 206.
I'd like to imagine, even though Belator 206 wanted to see it at night, I'd like to imagine how it felt when this event was not seen.
Sannoze's building was formed by 13 wars, and six of the Maincards were displayed in the English Channel 5 through the night.
At six o'clock in the morning, while Mr. Gabriel Moussey and Mr. Rory McDonald prepared for the war, the shipment was switched to Pepping, and the viewers of England also ate.
Because of this conflict, the audience who had not slept until the morning was particularly discouraged.
One fan wrote to Twitter about what he was going to do with the children's program, "There's a kind of bad Jack."
Mr. Dave Shubaltz, Vice-President of Belator, who was asked about this release, replied: "It seems that at 6 a.m. the rules of the government did not apply to the video games, and the children could not switch to the program."
"It's just that it's appropriate to pepping."
Mr. Belator, Mr. Scott Cooker, is talking about a future examination of the scheduled adjustment that will be considered by the English audience.
"I think it's gonna happen until I get back."
"But it was 6:00 a.m. on Sunday.
Now, it's the last thing I've ever done.
When the transmission was switched off, many texts were passed away.
I tried to get back.
But it wasn't.
We can promise that this will not happen in the next presentation.
I'm going to reduce from six wars to five ordinary wars, and I'm going to try to give you a lot of tests for fans, but that's what happened.
This was an unhappy situation."
Desert Islanddisk: Tom Darleigh, who felt "sexful" about sex.
Tom Darree, an Olympic diever, grew up to feel that he was weaker than himself in terms of sexuality, but it became a successful motif.
24-year-old Darrey didn't realize that until he went to high school, he said, "He's different from his neighbors."
Mr. Lauren Rabern, in a 4-deserved Irish disc radio station where Mr. Lauren Rabern spoke about Geilitz to give others hope.
And I also said that I was too tired to be able to win the Olympics because I became a parent.
Mr. Karsty Yang, the director of the long-term project, did not perform for months because of his illness.
Mr. Labourn's first program came up as Casta Way and said that the Dalele player felt "the weakest of all of them," because it was, "it wasn't socially allowed to love both boys and girls."
He says: "To this day, the emotion and emotion have continued to be relatively normal, giving me strength and strength for success."
He said he wanted to prove to himself that something was worth it.
Darrey, who was twice the target of the Olympics, became an influential LGBT campaign participant. This year, he attended the Congress of Commons, which was launched in Australia, and applied to many countries to legalize homosexuality.
Darle, the actor said that he was happy that he could live without having to open up his sexuality, but he was happy to talk to others about giving him a "hope."
Three times in the world's champion, Darrey, said that American filmmakers fell in love with a man's Dustin Lance Black. He said that when he met him in 2013, he was like "Supreys."
Darle married Black, who had been awarded Oscar at the age of 20, but it's not really a problem.
"I've had a lot of experiences since I was very young.
This Capule was born in June, and his son is Robert Ray Black=Darley, and he says that "all values have changed since the birth of his son."
"If you were asked about this last year, you would have answered everything about gold medals."
"But it's actually more important than the Olympic gold medal.
The Olympic gold medal for me is Robbie."
His son was diagnosed with brain cancer and named Robert, who died in 2011.
One of the last words that Father had left was whether the 2012 London Congress ticket had been used.
"I couldn't say I was no longer in this world."
"I was holding my father's hand until his breathing stopped, and I actually stopped breathing, and I realized that my father was not an enemy at first."
Last year, the Dale player participated in the 2012 Olympics and got a medal.
"Then I thought it was all I wanted in my life.
And this experience has been an inspiration to the first choice of the player.
Desert Island Disc, BBCClagio4, Sunday English time 11:15.
We're going to be in the middle of the day, and we're going to be in the middle of the day.
U.S. Phil Mikelson is trying to launch a new record on Sunday's 47th anniversary fight against the driver's cap, but we need to look at the form so that it doesn't have any bad results.
In this event two years ago, Michelson, who is trying to record the most 12 times, was ordered to be transferred from Captain Jim Forrick, who was the captain of the Sun.
Five-time media winners, Michaelson, have been noted at many conventions in the United States.
He is now the top of Carrie, but the driver can't say perfectly direct. 48-year-old Michelson is not an ideal condition to challenge L Golf National Course.
The course itself is too cruel, but in the 9th day trial, it's going to be fighting against the French Morinary Players of all the Europeans.
If the United States starts a 12-fold sigrmach in a 4-point state, it'll be a hot fight from the beginning, and it'll be really decisive for the Michelson player's attempts.
Mr. Fürich was confident of the Michaelson player, but not many more spoke.
"He fully understands the role he should play today.
"I think I have enough confidence.
He's a full-time player, and in the past, he's making a big contribution to the team.
I didn't expect him to play double.
I thought I'd play more, but I'm going to do this sort of adjustment.
He thinks he wants to go out more than anyone else thinks."
The Michelson player will record the Nick Flanders on Sunday, and will record most of the outputs of the Leader Cup trial.
This means that the career in the Leader Cup of the Michelson player is likely to end, and the results have never been combined with his personal record.
The battle of the Michaelson player is going to be between 18 and 20 to seven, but Mr. Fürich says that his presence brings him to the team.
"He likes to get a little out of the kitchen, he likes to be in the gym, and he wants to be in the gym."
"I think this week the young man's players are happy to deal with him.
He'll bring me more than play."
Mr. Thomas Bion, Captain of Europe, is aware that a big leader will soon be gone.
Mr. Thomas Viyon, Captain of Europe, has experienced his own experience, and he has been leading a great deal at the beginning of the last day's season, but he feels that the situation can be reversed.
Mr. Bion, who came out of Denmark, made a show in Balderama in 1997.
Remember when Mr. Bion, in L. Golf National, the 2018 team won the gold medal at 5-3, and last day saw a 10-6 lead, "Balderam was also leading a great deal.
This history shows me and the team that they don't know yet.
So, tomorrow's a lot of effort.
I'm going to go out and do what I need to do.
The test will not end until the score is shown.
We have a goal, that's to win the Trophi, and we're going to put our full effort into this goal.
This is what I've always been saying, but I'm interested in my team's 12 players, but I know what kind of player they are. They're the world's most powerful players.
Mr. Bijon adds: "It's like you're never going to wait.
Tomorrow is the enemy of tomorrow.
There's a different element to see each other tomorrow.
It's great to be with your partner when you're in the right place, but in a personal war, you'll try everything like golfer.
This message will not be sent to all players.
We need to get away from each other this time, and we need to do our own best."
In contrast to Mr. Viyon, Mr. Jim Forrick, he's looking for more individual players to lead himself than the team. Except for Jordan Space 3 points in 4 points and Justin Thomas.
Mr. Fürich himself had an experience on both sides of the final day of the event. The team he belonged in the past led the way to the bloc, but the European state team finally failed because of the "Midina's miracle."
In 1999, Captain Ben Crenshaw replied that he was asked when Mr. Crenshaw called the players on his last day.
"There are 12 important tests tomorrow, but it is expected that an explosion like the blockline and the media will start soon.
I'm going to be in the middle of it, and I'm going to have a press.
We're going to put together a strategy, and we're going to choose people directly, and tomorrow we're trying to perform miracles."
The Tomas player has been assigned to follow up, and the top match is to fight against the Rory McRoy player. And the Paul Casey player, Justin Roses, John Ram, Tommy Freewood player, and Ian Potter is against the European state of Ranking.
"Because you've set up a player in this order, I think it's going to work out the whole thing."
The new German army, and the extension.
The German Navy was preparing a new army for the Cold War, which is currently under way, in 2014, but the local media reported that it was not possible to achieve it until next year because of the system's ongoing problems and costs.
According to a statement made by the military spooksman, the launch of the most recent frigate ship in the Barden Vultenbelt was extended by the early half of 2019.
The warships were scheduled to be introduced in 2014, but the post-commissioned cable continued, and the ambitious plan was going to go awry.
In 2007, the Burden Vultenbelk Freegate, which was launched by the Navy, is being used in the army instead of the Bremen Freegate, which is currently in the process of ageing.
In addition to strong cannons, anti-air missiles and anti-powered missiles, some of the steel technologies, such as red-line nylons and sound nylons, are specifically included.
And the other important feature is that the maintenance bike is long enough, and it's possible that we can send the frigate boat to the place where we left Mother's port for the last two years.
But since the plan continues to be delayed, the Germans should play an important role in showing military power abroad, indicating that the latest military forces will be late for the actual beginning of use.
The next F125 frigate was a big news when the German Navy officially refused to start and returned to Hamburg's Brom Wont Fos.
This was the first time that the Navy returned the ship to the shipbuilding company after it was bought.
The reasons for the return are unclear, but the German media cites information that has been found to be a number of important "software and construction deficits" that the army does not adapt to the war mission.
The Burden Vultenbelk Freegate fleet is a half of the people needed for the first century's Bremen level, and the lack of software is particularly significant in order to be managed by about 120 seamen.
Also, because the Burden Vultenbelk class frigates are very heavy, and not only do the paformans fall, but also limit the upgrades that the Navy will be able to implement in the future.
The weight of this 7,000 tons of "Linland Faltz" is twice as much as the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to the structural deficit, the costs of the entire project, including training of crews, are rising as a problem.
The project's total cost is estimated to fall from the first 22 euros to the present 31 euros (36 meters).
Recently, there has been a warning that German forces are being weakened, and the issue of the latest frigate ships is very important.
Since this year, President Hans Peter Bertels of the German National Defence Commission has admitted that the Navy has actually lost the army that has prepared only a capacito.
The co-chair of the committee said that the problem is increasing with time and time, so that there is no substitute for the use of the old army.
The co-chair also expressed regret at the fact that the Burden Vultenberg Freegates were not really brought into the Navy.
National Trast, I'm going to force Komori's side.
A new study carried out in the outback area of Scotland shows how Comory uses the land while hunting.
The same study is expected to provide new information on the action of this unique species and to contribute to future protection activities.
In this study, researchers from the National Trast for Scotland follow the nature of common coumary, Sopranopisterle, Brownundguier, and Doventen invaegarden of Westeros.
Set a good record for the main point on the ground, and track the coumuli activity through the season.
NHS staff and volunteers are conducting mobile testing using a mobile detection device.
The recorded sound is all of the experts who analyze and add the number of orbits that come from the comory, and what they're doing.
It's based on analysis, it's based on genetic maps and reports, and it's been described in detail by the coumuli movement on the ground.
The NTS’s Rob Duwer Nature Protection Advisor is looking forward to revealing where the most important news site is for coumuli, and how their news sites are used by all kinds of species.
This information will help us to determine how to implement genetics settings and forest protection for coumalies and related species, as well as how to determine the meridities of reproductive management.
In Scotland and throughout England, the number of comoly abortions has decreased considerably over the past 100 years.
Coumuli is in danger of destruction due to the decline in construction work and the decline in vegetation, which affects the state of the trees.
In addition to the chemical treatment of pesticides and materials, attack by pet cats, and also by wind and light, are a risk to coumary.
Actually, Coumuli isn't blind.
But coumary is a habit that depends more on hearing than on vision than on night behavior.
Coumory uses the ability to respond to developments, captures insects at points, and recognises the dangers of flying.
Some 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, and over 76,000 hectares of property in the country, are facing very serious problems with Komori.
In the NTS, there are 10 experts who regularly investigate and investigate only coumary trees and sometimes protect coumary.
The NTS also first set up an area for the protection of comoly use in the state of Dumfries and Galloway in Scotland, where 8 species of comori are born in Scotland.
Mr. David Thompson, who manages the Estert, says this is an ideal environment for coumuli.
"This Slyve is the highest place for Coumuli."
"There's an old building here, and there's a lot of old trees, all of which are part of the comory landscape.
But because there's so much that we don't yet know about coumary, the activity here and elsewhere can help us understand what it takes to rejuvenate the coumary."
It is important that our colleagues destroy the tree that Comoly is born and that we destroy in one book, and that we kill the coumary of the young comory, and that it is important to verify the coumary before carrying out all the safe work in the land, so that it is possible to destroy the coumary of the land.
It's illegal to kill, abuse, rape, or cut down trees.
Elizabes Ferrer, who serves as a member of the Committee of the Scottish Ministry of the Protection of Coumory Trast, is seeking support from the locals.
He said, "There's still a lot to learn about Comory in Scotland, and he doesn't really know how Comory is acting."
The attorneys are ready to accuse the Lonaud authorities of denying the charges.
Mr. Christyano Ronoud denied the accusation of rape directed against his fellow, calling him a "false" and saying, "I just want their promulgation."
Mr. Ronoud's lawyer is preparing to appeal to the German weekly newspaper Dea Schupigel, which has raised this question.
This Portuguese player, who lives in the Ford of Yuvents, is accused of strengthening American women named Caslin Maulga in 2009 in a Las Vegas hotel.
Mr. Ronoud also suspected that he had to give this woman $375,000 and asked for a speech to make it go wrong, and Dea Schupigel reported to the bank.
A few hours after this report was reported, 33-year-old Ronoud called it "Feicnus" via a live video of the Instagrem's internship.
"No, no, no, no, no.
The content reported today is Feqnus," said Ronoud, who gave Barondor the last five times.
"I want to promote myself using my name.
It's good.
I'd like to introduce my name and introduce the name of my own magazine.
I'm all right, it's all right."
According to Reuters, Mr. Ronaud's lawyers are preparing to accuse Dae Shupegel of this suspicion and criticise the same magazine as "we have reported it in a way that we would like to excuse the assumption in the Privacy area."
According to Christian Schultz lawyer, Mr. Ronoud has been asked to "as one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years, only to see the depth of the violation."
The incident in the cave is said to have occurred in 2009 at the Paroms Hotel And Casino in Las Vegas.
According to the literature gathered at the Clark County Court in Nevada, Ronald and Maulga were told that when they met in the Nightclub, they went to the room where Mr. Ronaud strengthened the gates of Maulga.
Mayorga says that Mr. Ronoud was after the incident, and he said that he had done it in the bad part of "99%" and "1%."
According to the same document, Mr. Ronoud acknowledged that there was a sexual relationship between the two of them, and that he agreed.
Mayorga also went to the police and took pictures of her in the hospital, but then she went to the outside court to remind her of "the fear of revenge" and to remind her of the public humiliation and humiliation.
34-year-old Mayorga is now seeking to withdraw the reconciliation because of a suspected incident.
Mr. Ronoud, when the incident took place, was transferred from Manchester United States to Raalmadrid, and this summer he was deported to the strong Yuvents of Italy in one hour.
The British Bridge has lost the auto industry, "I'll regret it forever."
Greg Clark, a businessman, said that Britain "will always regret losing its status as a world-famous car manufacturer by briggitt."
He also added that if Britain's Toyota went to BBC and left the EU unconstitutionally, he "remembered that he would stop production in his company's Barnaston factory at once."
Clark, the businessman said, "I need a deal."
Japan's partners, auto mechanics, say that the delay in the country would result in loss of business if a blog was created out of agreement.
At the Barnaston factory in Toyota, "Oris" and "Avenice" have been produced, and 90 percent of the 150,000 plants produced last year have been exported to the United States of Great Britain.
"If the UK withdraws the EU at the end of March, the production of the factory will cease."
Honduras, BMW, Jagarlanddower, and other UK Automotive Meckers, are also concerned about the withdrawal of the EU from an agreement on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW is supposed to close the "mini" factory run in Oxford just one month after the blog.
It's about the risk of a superchain that happens when you're in trouble with the blogging.
Toyota's production line is carried out on the basis of "jastintime" and parts that come from inside the UK and the EU for 37 minutes are used for Odermed cars.
According to the Automotive Industry, if the UK withdraws from the EU on 29 March without agreement, it is possible that there will be delays in the country, which may result in late entry into the sector.
Toyota is unable to keep the warehouse in his company's dove factory for more than a day, so production will stop.
Mr. Clark told Prime Minister Mei that the "Checkers Plan" that he had suggested for the future of the EU is "proceeded to avoid research in the country where the industry is concerned."
"We need a deal, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to get the best deal for this occasion," he said in the BBCRAIO 4 video program.
"It's not just Toyota that the other marker companies are showing that we need to continue fully with the superkeys that have so far been working very well."
The length of the period to stop production is unknown, and the long-term cost will reduce the industry's competition and eventually affect employment.
Peter Towabarlis, who served for 24 years in the Bernaston factory, said that there is a high level of awareness among the members of the company.
The Government's publishers said, "the Government is recommending a reliable plan for the future of Britain and the EU."
"Tramp and Rosenstein's meeting is likely to be extended again."
The high-level meeting between President Donald Tranp and Vice-President Rob Rozenstein of Justice, the White House announced on Sunday that it would be possible for the debate to continue for the Supreme Court of Bret Cabano to continue for another week.
Mr. Rosenstein is taking part in Russia's elections, closely with President Tranp and Russia, and is overseeing the work of Special Agent Robert Moret, who is conducting investigations into the legal constraints of the president.
President Tranp's attention is drawn to the fact that Mr. Mora's independence is being influenced by the Vice-President of the Tranp.
Earlier in May, New York Times reported that Mr. Rosenstein had taken the device to record talks with President Tranp and had shown the possibility of avoiding the President by means of article 25 of the amendments to the Constitution of the United States.
Mr. Rosenstein denied the report.
But last week, his partner went to the White House, and it was reported that he was showing his intention to retire.
It was announced that a meeting with President Tranp of the New York State Department was to be held in the forest.
President Tranmp, who said that Mr. Rosenstein's more "will not be done," was delayed because he had been appointed by the Supreme Court's hearing committee, and at the hearing, Dr. Christine Breed, one of the women who had announced that he was doing a good deed with his partner, testified to the testimony of Dr.
On Friday, Mr. Tranp ordered a week's FBI investigation against the charges against Mr. Cabaner, and the vote in the upper room would be delayed.
Mr. Tranp's reporter, Sarah Sanders, responded to the Fox News on Saturday.
When she was asked about meeting Mr. Rosenstein, she said, "It's not over yet.
It's going to become clear in the future, and I always want to tell you the latest information in the release."
Some of the rapporteurs would say otherwise about this statement: Mr. Sanders has not visited the White House press release since 10 September.
Mr. Chris Wallace, who is a guest, asked why.
Mr. Sanderson said that at least Brigging didn't hate the "Standplay" on TV reporters. She said, "You can't deny what they're doing.
It shows that there will be more opportunities for direct contact with Mr. Tranp and the press.
"The President Tranp also said that he's spending more time than the former president's answer to questions," but he didn't prove it.
Brigging will be launched in the future, but Mr. Sanders will say, "If there is a chance that press can ask the President of the United States directly, it would be better for me to ask.
You know we've been doing a lot of good over the past few weeks.
Mr. Tranp is asking a good question when he comes out of the White House to attend the public session of the guest.
It's just that there's a single press conference.
That's why the president's nature of this week's free speech in New York is self-evident of the nature of the president who wants to be present before the rapporteur.
I'm going to write a letter to EU workers from Scotland's NHS, who are troubled by the blogs.
The insurance doctor told us about the EU staff in Scotland's NHS and the country's gratitude and the desire to remain in the same job after the briggitt.
Now, six months before the United Kingdom left the EU, Mr. Jean-Flima of the MSP published a letter.
The Government of Scotland promises that it will provide the costs of making a request for EU citizens who are already working in the government's already developed public service.
In the book, Mr. Freeman writes as follows: "In this summer, there was an ongoing dialogue between the United Kingdom and the EU about the delay, but it is expected that the end will come.
But the Government of England is also considering the possibility of Nordic scenario and is preparing for it.
For all of you, it's a very slow time.
That's why I'd like to say again, but I'd like to tell you that all contributions to staff that are not related to nationality are very valuable.
The EU countries and their colleagues from other countries are bringing valuable experience and technology, improving the functioning of health services, and contributing to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home, and I hope you've stayed here.
Cristion Abkhronby, I'm going to lose my head and get urgent surgery.
Cristion Abkhronby, a member of the Tigger of the state of Tennessee, reported that he was injured on the 31-27th anniversary of the defeat of Vanderbilt Commodas, and had an emergency operation, reports Mike Olgan of Tennessee.
According to the HeadCoch of Tennessee, Mr. Lord Reed, the damage has occurred in the face of Haftime.
"He came to Sydney and fell down there," said Mr. Reed.
Trainer and medical staff took oxygen injections on the sideline before sending the Abaclonby player to the event, and moved to the stratche for detailed research.
The state of Tennessee reported surgery on Chris Harris of WSMV, and the Abkhronby player was diagnosed at the Vanderville Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.
Harris added, "I don't know yet the details of the nature of the injury/the severity of the injury."
For two-year-old Abkhronby player in Redshaz, after Ilinoi's eviction, this was the first season in Tennessee.
On Saturday, he won a five-fold ticket until he was released from the trial, and he turned 18 times to the Siezon deal.
The foreign buyers of British non-emergency pay the tax and increase it.
Foreign investors will pay higher paper taxes when they buy British estates. The proceeds will also be used to support newly planned Tori Plans.
Mr. Covin was successful in collecting the votes for young people, but this movement is expected to be opposed.
The press tax is for people who do not pay taxes in England.
It is expected that the income will be over $1.2 million a year, which will be filled with homeless support.
Prime Minister Teresa May stated today that foreign buyers will be able to pay a higher print tax than when they buy British estates, and that the profits will be filled with homeless support.
Mr. Jeremy Covin succeeds in collecting the young, but this movement promises to tax on the high-income supply of affordable housing, and is seen as a temptation to counter it.
The press tax can be taught to individuals and lawyers who do not pay taxes in England, and the benefits are used to strengthen the response of people living on the streets of the government.
Additional taxes are added to the current paper tax, which will increase by up to 3%. Two years ago, the increase was introduced for the purpose of the second house and the use of the apartment.
It is estimated that older income will benefit from one year or two million pounds.
13% of London's new buildings are estimated to be purchased by EU residents. This increases the price of housing, and it is difficult for first-time buyers to buy housing.
In Britain, the capital, especially the capital, is becoming "Gosttown" by increasing foreign investors who spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy was announced one week later when Mr. Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in the press tax so young people could buy their first place.
His colleagues accused the construction company of holding land to maintain high housing prices and urged Prime Minister Mei to stop the upper limit on the "residencies" of British housing.
Mr. Covin also announced a joint proposal that focused on housing reform, including the elimination of debt and the removal of "non-smokers".
He also thinks that he wants to give the parliament a stronger authority to build new housing.
Prime Minister May said, "Last year, I spoke about trying to rebuild the British Museum through the Prime Minister's work.
This is also about restoring the housing market that we have broken down in our country.
The UK has always opened doors to people who want to live, work, build lives.
However, because of the work of the British population, the situation is never pleasant for individuals who do not live in Britain and for foreign businesses to be able to easily buy housing.
For many people who want to have a home, this has also become a far-reaching dream. And the dignity of the people on the street remains very real.
Jack Ross: "My dream is to be the manager of the Scotland team."
Mr. Jack Ross, a boss in Sanderland, said that he would be the manager of the Scottish team on his "real dream."
The 42nd of the Scotland team is trying to re-establish the Nose East Club.
Last Sessen, a colleague who led St. Milan to the Scottish Premiascap, moved to St. James O'Lite this summer.
"I wanted to play as a player in my country.
Bcap's got it, but it's just that," and he's talking to the BBC Scotland Sports Sound.
"The children grew up with your father and Hammond in Scotland, which was always bringing me back.
Such an opportunity can't be achieved without success in the management of the club."
The former manager of the Sanderland, Mr. Dick Adfokart, Mr. David Muys, Mr. Sam Aradis, Mr. Martin Onnel, Mr. Roy Keen, Mr. Gustav Poige, Mr. Paolo De Carni.
Aloa Asrechic's former vice-presidents are not afraid to contact famous people in such a famous club. In the past, they have been denied immigration from Burnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me now is to bring this club back to Premierig.
The club's organization and facilities are undoubtedly the primer of the project."
"It's never easy to get there, but it doesn't seem like it's been successful until the club gets back there."
Mr. Rose's manager is still three years old, but he's been working as an assistant boss in Danbert, and he has 15 months of experience as a coating staff.
Then, his friend sent Aloa back from his third hand to his third hand, and in the next six months, he led St. Milan, a Greek poet, to the winner of the Championship title.
Mr. Ross says he's calmer than he's been playing in Creed, Hartpol, Fork, St. Milan, Hamilton Academical.
"It was a real part of life," he said.
"I thought there was more management than the player.
I've been doing better as a player, and this might seem to be a little bit of a problem.
But it's hard to play.
There's a lot of things we don't have to do every week.
It's the same part as stress and pressure, but it seems that the manager is looking at himself.
I think I'm always trying to get into management, and it's happening now.
The presentation of the interview will be delivered at 12:00 a.m. in the summer of September 30th at 12:00 a.m. in the Sports Sound of Radioscotland.
The best time for drinking is at 5:00 a.m. on Saturday afternoon.
The British pope is suffering from economic hardship, but the effects of summer storms are increasing. On the other hand, it is becoming a burden for the restaurant.
According to the survey, the sales in July increased by 2.7% in the Papua New Guinea, and in the restaurant by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the Business Consulart of CGA, who welcomed the results of the survey, said: "The tough day of the day is continuing, and you have been healthy for a long time in the World Cup in July and June in the last month.
In June, the restaurant was reduced by 1.8 percent, but in July it became even harder.
In the last year's balance, the main commodity of the beverage is the most popular in the Dants.
It's not as much as a restaurant business, but it's suffering from the power of the sun.
It's like people's going to drink a drink.
The sales of pops and bar drinks in the market are increasing by 6.6% compared to the previous month, but they're down by 3% in terms of food."
RSM's Regier Hospitalitianist, Paul Newman, says: "These are the results that we have seen since the end of April.
The climate and large social/sport events have a major impact on the sales of foreign food industries.
It's not surprising that there's an ongoing economic crisis in the restaurant group, but while the cost pressure is constant, it's particularly painful to sell up to 4.8% over the same period last year.
In August, the weather was slowed down, and the future will be clear whether the weather will bring the expected peace."
The sales in July, which included the new development, and the total sales of popes and restaurants increased by 2.7%, reflecting the lack of development of Brand.
Kafar Pitch Tracker is a monitor of the industrial sales of the British pop, bar, restaurant sector, and collects and analyzes data from 47 economic groups. The combined sales are up to 90 million pounds, and is a famous Benchmark in the industry sector.
One of five children is hiding from their parents and keeping a social media account.
The survey revealed that 5 children were hiding from their parents and teachers and keeping social media accounts, including 11-year-olds.
The survey was conducted for 20,000 high school students, and it was found that the "insta" page was increasing.
This news has increased the risk of sexual content being printed.
Twenty percent of the students are said to have a "main" account to show their parents.
Five children are hiding from adults and creating social media accounts, including 11-year-old children.
The survey was conducted for 20,000 high school students and found that the "insta" page was increasing rapidly, and the "insta" is about the "instagram" website.
This news has increased the risk of sexual content being printed.
Twenty percent of students are said to have a "mein" account at the same time and a secret account that they're using to show parents who're not interested in content.
One mother found a 13-year-old girl's secret site and found that she was writing "reiping" to others.
The study was conducted at the HMC of the Digital Awenesuk and Independent School, and 40 percent of 18-year-olds had two profiles, one of which was a secret account.
HMC chief Mike Butchaman says: "We know that many 10-year-olds want to create online spaces that they don't find their parents or teachers."
Eilee Deller, the Scottish Asrechk committee, is called Aslit's voice.
At a general meeting of the Committee of the Scottish Stakeholder Association, Eili Dil was selected as a non-aggressive director.
The Doyle player is the most successful player in Scotland, and President Ian Beatty said it would be a good opportunity to live her experience at the international level for people who are attracting the sports market over the past 10 years.
"Eilie players are highly respected by Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world's Asletic community, and we are confident that the Asletic community in Scotland will be of great benefit to them to select her as a committee."
"I want you to work really hard to send the voice of Aslith."
Four Olympic medals, including the victory of 200m and 400m at the 1996 Athens Olympics, have been won, and a man of the United States who is now an expert in BBC as a regulator has performed a sexual brain tumor and is unable to walk.
He writes on Twitter: "Today, a month ago, I was in the brain.
I couldn't walk.
The doctor told me how much time it takes to get back.
It was a very demanding way of life, but it was completely restored, and it was going to be done again.
Thank you for your encouraging message!"
The mother's announcement of breast-feeding showed her to be breast-feeding.
The mother-in-law of the breast-feeding machine's markers published a statement on the breast milk found on the breast, which is divided into two on the Internet.
Elby, a consumer-oriented technology company, published a commercial music video with the release of the first Cyrento Weabad Mothers in the world, and the aim of the announcement was to express the mother's liberation through this new breast-feeding machine.
The mother of four of them would dance in the crowded little cowhouse, and sing like this: "I'm hungry myself, but I'm not hungry." "I may not have noticed, but not the cow's milk, but my milk house."
Coras goes on to say, "I'm breast-feeding, I'm breast-feeding, I'm breastfeeding, I'm breastfeeding, I'm breastfeeding.
This announcement, published on the Facebook page of the company, raised controversy online.
The film was repeated 77,000 times, and hundreds of comments were collected.
"It's a very wrong decision to use milk in the advertising of this product.
And we're going to have to get pregnant and give birth to babies in order to produce milk like we do.
Elby's breast-feeding machine is fixed without the breast-feeding barrier.
Another comment says, "Of course, this is going to be a trauma to mother and baby.
How can a human mother use a cow without taking a baby?"
And one of them adds, "It's not possible to make a statement."
There's someone who's protecting this propaganda.
"I think I'm a magical idea.
I think you're using it when you're still breastfeeding.
I really feel like a cow.
The announcement was just a little crazier, and I was able to get it.
It's a great product," someone said.
And the other person commented, "This is an interesting announcement to mom who thinks it's like a cow."
It's not a statement that claims or criticizes the dairy industry. "
At the end of the video, the women who were in trouble revealed that they were hiding a pump in Brazil.
The concept of the campaign is that many breast - feeding women are said to be like cows.
But Elvie pumps don't sound completely, don't get into the milk-producing brazier, so women can move freely, have babies, and even get out of the milk.
Anna Barrin of Mother's partner and ECD said, "Elvie Pump is a modern product, and I think it was a very exciting sale of petals.
In comparison with the female expression with the cow, it was meant to focus attention on the infant and all its problems and to show more interest in the amazing freedom of the new breast.
This is not the first time that Elvie Pump was raised.
During the working period of London, the mother of two babies who used this product came to Lanwey with Martha Jacobbouske of the designer.
I'm sending hundreds of children to the camp in Tent, Texas.
The number of displaced persons in one month has not changed in comparison, but the number of children detained has increased rapidly, some of which have been caused by harsh politics and politics, and it has been difficult to assure children.
To date, most of the insured immigrants are themselves, and they are afraid of endangering their own residence by applying for children.
The federal authorities and the other adults of the world need to present a ring, and their data have been declared to be shared with the immigration authorities, and the risk has increased.
Mr. Albens, senior officer of the Immigration Tax Administration, testified at the parliament that he arrested a number of ten persons who had applied for a non-cooperating minor.
The board later confirmed that 70 percent of the arresters had no crime.
"Nearly 80 percent of the individuals who are insurance or life insurance are illegally resident in the country, most of which are foreigners who are guilty of crime.
That's why they continue to follow such a person," said Mr. Albens.
According to the camp workers, in order to respond quickly to the child's request, the authorities have introduced a new rule, not 60 days after the detention of the authorities, which was already the basis for the detention.
Many don't attend their own own video chats and apply for legal status to the immigration court.
Those who are judged unworthy of salvation will be reimbursed.
According to the report of the worker and the interns of these months, the period of detention of children can lead to a state of insecurity and depression, resulting in violence and a loss of life.
The guardian said that there is a growing awareness that children are experiencing signs that are difficult to deal with in large facilities, such as Turnio.
Being emotionally prepared and not having enough time to tell your friends about divorce has added the possibility of causing the trauma that is already suffering.
Syria ordered immediate withdrawal from the Mia's army.
Walid Al-Muralem, who was discussed at the UN, called for the return of the Syrian refugees, even though the civil war had taken place in eight years.
Mr. Murem, serving the Vice-President, said that the foreign army had officially left the war with terrorism in the Syrian territory, "to respond."
"I need to withdraw immediately," he said at the meeting.
Since 2011, 36,000 people have died and millions have been following home, claiming that "the fight against terrorism is almost over."
Syria said the terrorist group and the "unlawful foreigners" saying, "until we get out of all Syria, we will continue this holy war."
America has left 2,000 soldiers in Syria for the training and instruction of the Arab Arab forces against President Walshad, President Al-Alamad.
France owns more than 1,000 land soldiers in this war-damaged country.
With regard to refugee issues, Mr. Murem says that there is no problem with the conditions of return, "some Western countries are spreading unreasonably terror in order to remain outside the country."
"We called international society and humanitarian organizations to encourage the return of the country."
"They have politicalized what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until the political agreement to end the war was reached between Asad and Azad.
The U.S. diplomats say that Russia and Turkey's recent agreement to set the ground at the last important point in the rebellion against Idrib has created an opportunity to advance political dialogue.
According to the agreement of Russia and Turkey, 300 million people live in this country, a large number of attacks have been avoided by the Syrian forces supported by Russia's troops.
Just, Mr. Murem stressed that there was a "explain deadline" in agreement, and he indicated that military action would mark Jihad, including a fighter from the Nazi war line, who was a "damaged" with Al-Qaida.
Mr. Stefan De Mischula of the United States Special Envoy wants to gather early meetings of the new committee formed by government and party members, and to develop post-war Syrian law and implement the elections.
Mr. Murem suggested that the Syrian Government should participate in the Committee and that the Committee's work should be limited to "visiting the provisions of the current law" and warned against fraud.
Why the tramp is re-elected.
According to this theory, as many liberal audiences may wish, unless the bomb and the scandals were signed as presidents early, Tranp will be re-elected in 2020.
I'm sure it's going to be the most dramatic Finary of Presidents so far.
So far, there's no sign of the audience getting angry.
Since 2014, the number of Gordenawar audiences has increased in CNN by more than 105 000 and MSNBC by close to 160,000 and 3 times.
According to the Nilsen, Fox News has increased the average audience of Gordenware to 17 million to 240 million people 4 years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Mador Show has recorded the number of cable channels audiences in the main news group at the top of the night.
"This is a fire that people can't understand," said the president of the capital after the attack.

When I contacted Mr. Freys this week, outside his home on the north coast of Kaway was 80 times in the sky, but he saw MSNBC recording CNN in the house.
He could not leave without Bret Cabano's testimony to the Supreme Court of Justice and the future of the Supreme Court.
"It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr. Freys to me.

It is not surprising that the Parliament's reorganization of the electoral region in the 17th region of Pennsylvania, where two of the same parliamentarians have been fighting the same presidential campaign.
In this election area outside Pittsburgh, recently redesigned last year, President Connor Ram of the Democratic Party, who won a special election last year, is standing.
The candidate against Mr. Ram is Mr. Kius Ross, of the former joint party of the former Pennsylvania, which is a majorly complex 17th region.
In January, the Supreme Court of the state of Pennsylvania decided that the former electoral region would benefit from the common party's illegality, and the electoral area was redesigned.
The new 17th district electoral war is a serious dispute that has invested funds from the DCCC, the main political party's funding support group, and the National Social Action Commission (NCRC).
Mr. Ram, who took note of the special election of the 18th anniversary of the election in Pennsylvania in March, made his name known in Pennsylvania.
It has held a joint party for more than 10 years, and President Donald Tranp has won 20 points in the election area.
The political commentators say that the Democratic Party is only beneficial.
The United States withdrew to El Salvador, China, after examining the sentence.
The diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had approved China without much opposition from the United States.
In June 2017, Mr. Tranp went to Panama's Fan, Carlos, President Barella, to a friendly meeting, and they stayed at the Panamanian hotel until they withdrawn the crew of Tranpton.
With regard to "the latest decision on the suspension of Taiwan's recognition", the governor of the state department decided to call back the officials of the American diplomatic organization from Panama" and Mr. Hezer Nawaart announced his statement earlier this month.
However, the sanctions were examined, including drug drug responses, development and economic support, and only El Salvador, which was estimated to have received $14 million from the United States in 2017.
In addition to the reduced and targeted visa restrictions on financial assistance, the punishment was to be accompanied by pain for a member of Central America who was subjected to high unemployment and death rates.
In the course of internal investigations, North and Central American authorities extended a high-level agreement focusing on security and economic development, which was a follow-up to the same meeting last year that was thought to be a step forward in preventing immigration flows to the United States.
However, until mid-9th of May, government officials announced that they wanted to continue meeting and actually completed their review of the punishments to El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence says that he is planning to discuss the revenue that the government is planning to discuss at a parliament scheduled for mid-monthly 10th.

The report by Mr. Bolton of the White House rejected a comment on the details of what three U.S. senior officials had discussed.
These explanations were confirmed by an external analyst in the state of the state where the name was unknown.
The results of the investigation.
The next research hand has the possibility of a report by Mr. Robert Mueller on the potential of Mr. Tramp's judicial hazard.
According to the report, Mr. Mueller is looking to investigate whether Mr. Tranp's election campaign was targeted by Russia.
When Parliament's power changes, Mr. Tranp is ready for the re-election war, with more than half of the political parties ready for the election, and there will be an explicit responsibility for the parliamentarians.
And there are many conditions, but it does not mean that Mr. Tramp or the President of Europe will always be unemployed.
We need to make a choice about how long that challenge will be.
If the West opposed Hitler and supported the Czechs of Munich, in 1938 German officials were ready to decide their Codetors for Hitler.
He failed and escaped the opportunity to avoid the last years of mass murder.
History will change such a turning point to the point, and the rapid progress of democracy will be accelerated and prevented.
The Americans are facing some of these different approaches.
What if Mr. Tramp, Deputy Chief of Justice, who is conducting Mr. Muller's investigation, found out about Mr. Lozenstein.
Mr. Rosenstein has been in the background since the article about the fact that he had been recording to the President last year, and that the president did not qualify for his assignment.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times article is incorrect.
"How will the Supreme Court respond if the FBI's investigation for Mr. Bret Cabano is not complete or fair, or if there is a high-trust charge against sexual violence and false testimony?
Moreover, will we vote in the mid-election of the Parliament to train Mr. Tranp?
If these tests fail, democracy will enter into a long winter.

Gram Drans of Rangers is a Lapid Winner.
Lengers will take Lapid Winn home on Thursday, and this month, we're going to meet Vijaral in Spain, and we're going to win the Austrian team fighting this time, and we're going to have a chance to break the Group G of Europe's League.
Graham Durans of Midfield did not come out of the trials of this season because of the dark blues of the Bizarade War, which had been fought in two to two, but he believed that Rangers could be able to fly the next time.
"It's a good team, and it's good to get points," said 31-year-old player.
"We believed that we could get at least one point when we went in.
Maybe it was finally said well, but the whole thing is going to be fair.
I think the first half was good, but we made the last half of the effort, and we made the experiment successful.
It's a big fight in Europe on Christmas Eve.

In fact, there are few people who are talking about the family.
In a national survey, about half of the couples are talking about the cost of long-term care.
It was only 10 percent talking to the kids about it.
"People want to talk to the family, but they don't actually have a meeting," said Holly Snider, president of the National Life Insurance Society.
I'll show you how to start a conversation next.
I'm talking to my wife and children, and if I don't know what I'm hoping for in the past, the family can't be prepared to take care of it.
We'll talk to the Advisor and the family and discuss where and how to take care of them. These options will be an important element in determining the cost.
Finanshal uses the Advisor, which helps you to think about such a cost-effective way of paying.

The federal police are demanding a death penalty for terrorist suspects in New York City.
New York's federal police have been calling for the death penalty for the alleged terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people. Since 1953, it has not been a very special one in the federal crime.
Sypoff (age 30) used a truck hired by Home Depos, and attacked the West Side of Louar Manhattan on the highway near Highway, killing passengers and bikers.
In order to justify the death penalty in New York, according to the intention of calling for the death penalty imposed in the New York area, the investigation needs to confirm that Sipoff had deliberately killed eight victims and that he had suffered a serious injury.
According to the documents of the Court, this complaint also suggests that there is a possibility of death.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal attorney accused Cipop of eight murder crimes, 22 cases involving the destruction of the car.
The attack requires "a lot of planning and planning," said the investigators, "the crime of Sipoff is a murder and violence."
"Syfro, Habibreevick, Sipoff, Diego, Enrique, Enrique, Nicolas Creebs, Anlor, Darren Drake, Ariel, Elridge, Annan Feluch, Arnan Diego Mendosa, Alejandro Damien Pagnoco, has caused damage to family and friends."
Five of the victims were visitors from Argentina.
Ten years ago, before the death penalty was imposed in the New York area.
The defendant's Card Barnes was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but he was declared innocent in September 2009.
In a federal case in New York, before the death penalty was executed two years ago, Julias Rozenberg and Essel Rozenberg, who had been convicted of spying for the Soviets during the cold war, were sentenced in 1953.
On June 19, 1953, the death penalty for Lozenberg's wife was executed.
Sympof of Uzbekstan was not responsible for his conscience after a few days and a few months after the attack.
He said he didn't regret what he did to the detective, so the police announced.
In the case of the prosecution, Sypop said he was thinking of the attack on ISIS on his phone.
The police also announced that they asked ISIS to put the flag in the hospital.
In addition, 22 cases have been accused of being innocent.
Mr. David Patton, a federal public prosecutor for the protection of Siopoff, said he was clearly disappointed by the investigation's decision.
"We believe that the death penalty is not a criminal responsibility for the possibility of being released, but that it should only bring about a long-term tragedy for all concerned."
Syopof's defenses were asking him not to punish the investigator for his death.
The vice-president of the Party, the EU of England, said that Mr. Nigel Farage was right.
Mr. Nigel Farage declared today that "initiate the people's army" in protest against the party's meeting.
The leader of the Independent Party needed to "sympathize" the critics of the Euro pean debate because a member of Mr. Teriza said he was eligible for EU negotiations.
Peter Boone, Vice-President of the Conservative Party, said that while Mr Farage was away from the United States, England was already away.
However, the issue that Mr. Maye was faced with dealing with the division of parliamentarians was that the remnant of the party participated in protests in the city against the EU's expulsion.
The Prime Minister is finding it difficult to maintain the check-in plan in the EU, the separation, the rest of the EU, and the EU's crimes.
Mr. Mayi's lawyer, trying to reach agreement with the EU during the protest, claimed that he had forced her to choose some of her "disgusting" cases for Euro pean suspects and business parties.
Mr. Bonn said, "The departure of Solihal is a distance from "the decision-making meeting" and "the checkers want to give up."
He said that Mr. Farage should be able to negotiate with the EU as a group.
"If he's worried, we're already leaving."
Mr. Weringborro says, "I am the EU, but I have to stop the checks."
"You can't let the world fight and become a subject of war.
We want to have our own laws in this country.
Since the 2016 vote, Mr. Bonn has come up with the idea that the world has changed. "The idea that the British people want to keep their minds fixed is not entirely true."
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Security Party, also took part in the meeting and said to the rapporteur, "I just want to say this.
"The Czechs are uncomfortable with the generals, the opposition does not vote, and the activists who actually turn the streets and win the election are not happy.
I want you to take the checkers down and listen to the opinion."
In a message addressed to Mr. May, he said, "The Prime Minister can remain in position when he keeps his contract."
Mr. Farage said that if the decision to vote in 2016 was to be reversed, politicians who attended the meeting said that they would be "feeling Precise".
"This is a problem of confidence between national and political levels."
"Because they're trying to break the EU's exit, we can't accept it now."
I'd like to make you feel more at the political level that you're trying to break out of the EU.
"The people of this country, which has led the EU to a victory, will not rest until they become proud and proud English."

Mr. Wallen turned to the presidential election and said, "Prepared."
Mr. Elizabeth Wallen, U.S. Prime Minister, said after his 11-month election, he was going "to the presidential election and ready to enter."
Boston Globe reports that this Marchese Democratic Party has been talking about the future on Saturday at the meeting in the West of Massachusetts.
Mr. Wallen, who often criticises President Donald Tranp, is referring to the re-election of Mr. Tranpsett, who served as Vice-President of the 2016 Tranchuts election, in contrast to Mr. Jeff Dil.

Mr. Wallen said, "It's time for a woman to point out the government that destroyed the White House, and that's also the president of the women."

Russia, Granprey: Team, Oder, Luis Hamilton won Sebastian Bethel and won the title.
On Saturday, the moment that Barteri Botas passed the choice over Luis Hamilton, a team of Mercedes, Oder, showed that he played a major role in the race.
The botas who cut off the good start from Paul's position were trying to protect the first two weeks of his life, to make a fight with Hamilton at Bethel, and to destroy the chance of Hamilton's victory.
At first, Bethel was pittin' and Hamilton was going to follow around the clock, but it's usually going to decide the race.
Hamilton, who was on Marsedes a week later, came to the back of the Bethel, but on the third floor of the Conner, he was attacked and killed by a fire department that had stopped a double-tracked fireplace.

The team did a great job with 1.2 Finnish and me," Hamilton said.
It's a very bad body, Ranger.
President Donald Tranp made a mockery of the claim that the Prime Minister at the Sunday meeting, Dean Fynstein, refused to reject a letter from Mr. Christine Fod, who accused him of sexual abuse by the Supreme Court, Mr. Bressey.
The president, who spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, commented that Mr. Ford's testimony in the Supreme Court was not directly quoted, but commented that the incident in the upper room showed that people were "lying badly and maliciously lying."
"There's a chance that's happening in the upper room, and one of the wonderful things that's happening in the last few days is when you've seen anger and you've seen those who're angry and those who've been lying in shame."
"Look at Alice and Rick." I don't.
"I don't."
Do you remember?
Diane, Fanstein, did you quit?
Remember her answer, did you give up the document?
No, no, no.
I didn't laugh."
Wait a minute.
We gave up, no, no," added the Prime Minister's impression.
Mr. Fainstein received a letter in 7 months that Mr. Ford received details of the suspicions against Mr. Cabano, which was rejected on the top of 9 months, but Mr. Fainstein denied that Rick was from the office.
He said to the committee that he was hiding Dr. Ford's application, but he didn't deny it."
"She relied on me to keep her secret, and I kept her secret as I did."
But because she denied, there seemed to be no conversation with the president who spoke at the Saturday evening meeting.
Maybe she didn't think, but it was the worst body ranger I've ever seen."
3 The president of the Democratic Party has used doubts for its own purpose, in addition to the case of the Supreme Court, which was accused of having committed sexual misconduct against women.
"They are also determined to take the necessary measures.
It's a shame, it's a shame, it's a shame, it's not gonna hurt anyone, it's not gonna hurt anyone, it's not gonna hurt anyone, it's not gonna hurt anyone, it's not gonna hurt anyone, it's going to get power and power."

The airline that carried off a fleet of passengers and 47 passengers who had suffered a fall in the sandy sand dunes of the Pacific of Micronesia said that it had been safe for all 47 passengers and passengers to escape from the planes they had hit, but one man was unaware of the way.
A. Newgini announced that one of the men of the passengers was missing in the afternoon.
The airline announced that it was working with the local authorities, hospitals, research authorities and that it was taking control of the location of men.
The airlines did not respond directly to the request for detailed verification of passengers such as age and nationality.
The boat saved other passengers and passengers on land by landing at Tuk Island airport.
The authorities said seven people were transferred to the hospital on Friday.
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and that the situation was stable.
The reason for the fall is that it's not even known.
The airline and the U.S. Navy announced that the plane had crashed into the Sango before the flight.
Some of the observers thought the plane was overrun.
U.S. passenger Bill, Mr. Janes, said that the plane had entered into a low-aird airway.
"That was very good," said Mr. Janes.

Analist explains a series of nights when a woman was still alive.
The investigation authorities held the final discussion on Saturday, 2014 in a review of the men who were questioned about the crime of women living in Mississippi.
Paul Lorelet, an analist in the U.S. Department of Justice, testified that he had been a reporter for several hours.
He used his cell phone records to cut off a 29-year-old lawyer Kington and her move on the day that 19-year-old Jessica Chambers died.
Mr. Lorett said that on the night of Chambers died, he received some data from his cell phone location to show that Teris was with him on the night that Teris died.
When he said that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the phone data showed that he was with Chambers, and the police went to Sanford to talk.
The Sanford testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the investigator asked if Teris said he was on the Sanford truck that night, he testified, "It's a lie he's saying because his truck was in Nashville."
When Chambers died, Teris said he had met him for about two weeks.
It was only a week ago that I met in the phone record.
Mr. Lorelett said that since Chambars died, Teris had removed his phone information from the Chamber's text, communication, and communication.
"He lost her from her life," said Mr. Hall.
The defendant is scheduled to start the final reply on Sunday.

The High Breed: is it a reasonable hip hop?
Three hip hops are trying to pick up the image of this genre's minimas.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hip hop has been away from the principle of political message and social issues.
They want to go back to that hole and take the conschaship hop again.
Artists such as Fajis and Komon have seen the past resurrection in the UK through artists such as Akara and Loki.
And the black man?
Tell the couple who were fired after the "man-of-the-kind" text.
New York's Bebesitter tells the couple that they were divorced differently.
His wife denied that he was a racist.
Linzi Prasco-Fraksman, a mother of two, knew that the new Bebessitter was black when he arrived on his first day of work in 2016.
"Novey and black" and "Prasco-Fraksman" sent her husband a text.
But that text was not a husband, and I sent it to Mr. Morris twice.
According to the New York Post, after the loss, "the plasco-Fraksman was disappointed that the former African American beekeepers were waiting for the Philippines instead of the quality of the job.
Mr. Morris was paid one day and returned to his own home at Uber.
This time, Morris told this couple that they had no contracts and that if they worked on the first scheduled accommodation, they're looking for $350 a day and six months of rent.
"I want to tell them that I don't have to do this," she said to the post on Friday. "I know it's different."
His wife denied the claim that he was a racist and claimed that it was right to retire because she could not trust her after giving a negative opinion to Mauritius.
"My wife sent her some text, but it doesn't mean that.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists, Joel Plasco's husband said to the post.
"But if you were wrong, could you pass on your children to your friend who you had shown an apocalypse attitude?
Did you just have a baby?
I can't."
In order to justify the complaint as a "force," Prasco said that she had been born a baby for only two weeks, "a very difficult situation."
"Are you going to do something like this for someone in such a difficult situation?
It's not very good," the investment banker added.
On the other hand, the court's views are rapidly expanding, and couples are convicted on social media, and their behavior and logic are being Basing.
Paidentonpabricher, I'm sure the new letter will show you that there's been an unwelcome disturbance in the audience.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was soon accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to imagine someone who's first reading.
Now, what you know about padding is a great success.
She said she was happy that her father, who was working as a BBC cameraman, had not been accepted for work, said that the 60 years after his death, the publication that he received last year, said was "biterwit."
She added that her father was quietly thinking about her success.
"He wasn't a very quiet person, he wasn't a person to talk to."
"But, as Paddenton was very real to him, he felt as if he had done something to his child, as if he had not done anything to him.
I think my father was trying to make Padington feel that way.
It was his creation and imagination, but he always called himself Paddington."
My daughter was in a dead bed, and she didn't say anything else over the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was rushed to the hospital in Nice's Lee Pastsul2, and the doctor was in the hospital, looking forward to it.
"In a very dangerous situation, Nad kept calling to say she couldn't help it," said Ednan Lapelus.
"And when Nad called, she died two minutes later without telling anyone else.
And I told you.
"Dear Tashi, I love you very much."
I'll be right there.
I'll be right back.
The doctor slowly removed the medication that had given her heart to stop, and her movement stopped.
She's already dead, and this is all stopped.
I was just sitting there waiting, knowing everything was happening.
Because many families and people were around, and they couldn't cry or cry.
I would not have waited until death."
In the deep grief of losing her daughter, Edna Raquels was soon on the plane with other passengers and did not have to endure the situation.
"No one knew it," she said.
"The end of the day was here, with my head up.
It's hard to explain, but I felt the pain I couldn't bear.
He needed my love and understanding.
He really loved his daughter."
The sad women put a card on the bridge to protect themselves from suicide.
Two women who lost their loved ones in suicide are working to prevent their lives from being cut off.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hanfries continue to work on a card that records a number that can receive a touching message and support.
My son, Tyler, who was 13 years old, was seriously ill and died at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I'm feeling daily," she said.
David, a 45-year-old living in Lidney, said her son was a wonderful future boss.
"Everyone knew his smile.
Everyone said that his smile would appear in any room."
But he was "in a really dark place" and got a job before he died.
In 2014, 11-year-old Tyler's brother discovered his brother's death.
Mr. Davis said, "I'm very worried about something connected."
Mr. Davis made a card. "I want people to know that you have someone to talk to, even if you're friends.
Don't put yourself in the dark, talk to me."
Mr. Davis and his many-year-old friend Hanfries lost his 15-year-old partner Mark after his mother died.
"I didn't say anything whether he's falling down or he's disappearing," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was very low on Christmas day-- when the children opened the present, he had nothing to do with the children's eyes.
She said that his death was a big trauma for the children, but she said, "It broke the family.
I've done it in Barbara.
But we don't all have to fight this."

The FBI has started research to predict the future of Bret Cabano's future.
"If we could actually get what he was asking for, we could end up a little bit.
Why didn't Mr. Cabaner and his supporters like the FBI investigation?
Their tails are all a matter of timing.
The mid-election was forced on November 6th of the previous five weeks, and it was expected that if there was a failure in the community party, they would be very weak in the choice of the people they wanted to choose in the U.S. Supreme Court.
George W. Bush next called the Prime Minister and urged him to support his wife, Ashley, who was following Mr. Cavanno and his secretary at the White House.
What happens after the FBI makes that report?
A vote will take place at the top of the House, with 51 joint parties and 49 democracies.
If Mr. Cabano is unable to get at least 50 votes in the upper room, it will break the odds of Mr. Mike Pens, Vice-President, and it will be to admit him to the Supreme Court.
The number of deaths in North Korea is reduced under Kim's rule.
Seven years ago, Kim Johnon, who had the right to abstinence, reduced the number of deaths in North Korea to the country of Korea, said the lawmakers of the country of Korea.
Pak Bionseg, quoted by a Hong Kong State Department, says that 1,127 names last year were compared to 2,706 refugees in 2011.
Mr. Pak said that the main reason for the high rate of border management in North Korea and China is the higher rate by the private sector.
Pianian doesn't make public comments.
Many people from the north are given citizenship in the next country.
Saul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have been crossing the country illegally since the end of the war in 1953.
Many of them have the largest border in North Korea and have fled through China, which is more than simply protected by the non-weapon-free zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers the dead to be more illegal than the refugees and gives more pressure.
In fact, the North and South relations that still exist in the war situation have improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pionjan for focusing on the non-nuclear trade that had stopped.
This was followed by a great deal of agreement on the non-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula at the historic meeting of President Donald Tranp of the United States in Singapore and the historic meeting of Kim Johnon in June.
However, on Sunday, Mary Yoonho, outside North Korea, has condemned the United States' sanctions that have not progressed since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, we are not confident of the security of the country, nor are we going to engage ourselves in non-nuclearization under such circumstances," he said in a speech by the New York United Nations.
Nancy Parosi said that it was inappropriate for the office of the Supreme Court to "histrick" for Bret Cabano.
In the lower secondary minority, Nancy Paroshi called the Supreme Judge Britt Cabanno "histrick" and said his condition was inappropriate for the service of the Supreme Court.
Parosi commented on the text of Trivise Festival, which was opened in Austin, Texas, and interviewed on Sundays.
"If a woman had such an attitude, it would not be possible to think that it would be expressed as "histrick."
Cabano strongly denied the claim that both of them had committed sexual abuse with a teenager to Dr. Christine Breeze Fford.
During his opening remarks, Cabano was very sensitive, and during his family and high school discussions, he expressed his frustration and frustration.
He also strongly criticized the members of the Committee's Democratic Party and called on the presidential election of 2016 on his claim to be a "recorded name damage, codined by the Liberal Party who was angry with the fall of Hilary Clinton."
He was convinced by Cabano's testimony that he proved that he could not comply with the Supreme Court because he was prejudiced against the Democratic Party.
"He doesn't think it's appropriate to the manager for these statements and the clinton and the Democratic Party."
The Peruvian party was asked whether he was going to shoot if Cabano was recognized, and whether the Democratic Party of the House of Commons would get more than half of it.
"If he does not speak the truth to Parliament and the FBI, it is not only the Supreme Court but also the Court that is currently in operation."
Cabano is now the judge of the D.C. High Court.
As a democratic party, she remembers that he is considered a protective judge, and she remembers the possibility that Cabano will rule over the medical insurance reform and the Rouwede case.
In his public hearing, Cabano refused to ask whether he was going to cover the decisions of a particular Supreme Court.
"It's not the way you're going to the court for people who're in a hysterical mood."
And a woman needs to touch it.
It's a very serious crime, and months of anger and years of anger, and she can't remove it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," said Mr. Steinem to me after 45 years.
"I don't think it's special, but how?"
She went on, "I was very helped by a woman who was somewhere in a ecstatic, and she cried when she felt angry, but she started to cry, and she started to develop techniques when she started to cry, and to talk to her partner," I think I was sad.
I'm angry."
And she's just crying.
And I thought it was great."
Because it's not basically understood, it's recognized as a part of anger.
In the past work, there was a clear memory of the office of male excellence, and when I was furiously angry, I said, a woman who was a little scared of the day was brought to the head of a lady who was a little scared of the day.
"Don't ever show them shame," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're glad you're down. "
Members of the then Democratic Party from Colorado, Patricia Schlader, were working towards the leadership of President Gary Hart.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart woke up and withdrew from the election, called Monkviness, Mr. Shuleder felt that he had no reason to think that she would stand up for the president.
"It wasn't a good decision," she laughed 30 years later.
"There are already seven other candidates in the election, and the last one was a candidate.
Someone called the white snowman and the seven little ones.
Because it was late to start the campaign, and she swore that she wouldn't go out until she got $2 million.
It was a war.
Her supporters knew that the man was not interested in offering $1,000, and that she had no one else to give it to.
"They think I'm getting divorced?" she laughed.
When she made a speech indicating that she was not officially raising the campaign, she expressed a variety of feelings -- thanks to the people who supported her, financial agreement, and not representatives, to the very difficult system of raising the right to taigat, and to express her anger against women.
"You thought my nervousness was weakened."
"Crinex is my sponsor.
I remember thinking what kind of words I would write on my gravestone.
"Sniffs"?
It's not like it's going to happen.
The U.S. and China's civil war has opened the screen with an attack, and in the long run, two or more national conflicts are likely to be of interest to Beijing for a long time.
The President of the United States, Donald Tranp, warned this year about taxing the major Chinese exports of solar power plants, steels and aluminium.
The biggest tax that has been made this week has been the effect of a new tax, which has had an impact on prices equal to $2000 billion ($1500 billion) and is actually taxed in half of the products imported from China from the United States.
Beijing paid the same amount, and nearly $600 billion of US products were taxed between 5 and 10 percent.
China promises to fight against the United States of America, and the second world economy will not be able to move immediately.
It means falling to Washington, but following the United States publicly is a great disgrace for China's top leaders' close-up.
However, experts say that if Beijing properly handles its card, it will be able to support China in the long term because of the two economic interdependences.
"The fact that early political decisions by Washington or Beijing create a state of economic confusion in both countries is more dangerous than the viewers had ever imagined," said Abigail Grace, head of Asia's new U.S. security centre in the United States of America.
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Syria, the refugees are ready to return.
Syria is well prepared for the return of self-repatriated refugees, and is also calling for the reconstruction of the countries that have been devastated by the war over the past seven years.
According to the UN Council, Foreign Minister Warrid Al-Morem said the state is improving.
"Today, as a result of the progress of the fight against terrorism, conditions on earth are more stable and safer," he said.
The government is continuing to restore the area that was destroyed by the terrorist.
All situations are now prepared for refugees who return to their country, not for terrorism, for daily life and for their own economic situation, but for the refugees who return to their homeland.
The UN estimates that more than 55 million Syrians have escaped since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another 60 million people still live in the country and need humanitarian support.
Al-Muralem said that the Syrian government would receive support for the reconstruction of the corrupt country.
However, he stressed that support from countries that support conditional and asylum is not to be accepted.

So I'm grateful that Thomas chose me.
I'm so happy that I can take the cup back.

We've made a lot of noise.
Let's respect Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players played well.
We're going to reorganize a team, work together with the American PGA and the Leader Cup Commission.
