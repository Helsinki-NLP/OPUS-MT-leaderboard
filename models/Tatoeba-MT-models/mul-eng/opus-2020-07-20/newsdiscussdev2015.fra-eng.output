It seemed to me to be a typical rugby club.
In an English university, maybe...
Nothing to see with the rugby clubs I know in NZ.
But it doesn't make any sense, does it?
Of course not, but the premise that says it's running in the rugby is the big thing...
Yes, we do not interrupt the prayers of the Muslims and we do not break the human nose during the drinking games (end, unless it is part of the game), but we are actually painting in the dark for some disoriented evenings.
I've never played a drink game based on the Nazi theme.
Yeah and Ride the Bus enough.
I left a similar comment on the previous article because the language and feeling expressed in the first year's students' perspectives seemed quite typical.
That said, this new information left no doubt in my eyes that they will go much further than the mystical posters and blogs under the alcohol company that are often associated with university rugby teams.
The incident with the Muslim students shows particularly well that they were trying to cause the maximum.
You probably don't know anything about rugby clubs.
But why let your injuries and stereotypes interfere with the facts?
I imagine that the LSE rugby team is popular with former students of these schools for whose rugby competition is a tradition.
In other words, old guys from the private.
There are very different environments from those who play in rugby in NZ, with very different attitudes.
So, are the "missynes" posters acceptable?
I've never seen racist behavior at my university's rugby club, but the racing courses through the campus, the flight, the destruction of property and the mission were all part of the game.
Absolutely not.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you in my last comment.
You can see it differently: you say your own body itself is part of this ancient water.
I'm going to win a chance.
then this interstellar cloud (ouf, not traditional:)
@lux You have not read the article well: a small half of the water of your pastis has more than 4.6 billion years...
Yeah, well, we can stop when we even consider that the fleet of the pastis is on an average of more than 2.3 billion years, which is no longer as bad as it is.
A sacred foot of nests to the catastrophic and rainforests of every field that predicts the end of the oceans and resources in water, while this water always exists.
An irrefutable proof that the recovery was stopped 20 years ago (see the remarkable work of Serge Ferry funded by Total and Areva).
@manon tooo: What evidence is there that the rechasing has stopped?
I can't see the connection.
I think Manon Troppo's comment is ironic.
Hey, and for the second grade and the irony, what do you have as a signal?
So you don't understand much about ecological problems.
It is not a question for the "catastrophists" as you say to worry about the destruction of the oceans but rather the reduction of human water reserves (you know the sweet water that represents less than 1% of total water reserves on our planet).
And then more generally this is not the most threatening climate re-use for our species, but especially the reduction of low or non-renewable resources (gas, oil, rare metals) that sustain our lifestyles more and more gourmonds.
Of course, in the study that you are reading and that you are doing your best to quote the source, there is little doubt about the truth of the conclusion.
With regard to the water problems, I assure you that the French are far from being concerned with xD Then you have to stop considering the ecology as an unfathomable dogma, the hole of the ozone layer is being referred to calmly (estimated to 100% for 2050 at the current rate).
The ecology yes, the religious ecology Dogmatic and irritant, not thank you.
"Then you have to stop viewing the ecology as a dogma without fail, the hole of the ozone layer is moving slowly" Yes, it's not like it was a spontaneous movement that would come from nothing.
@martin: I just want to specify that climate warming is a necessity because if we emit too much CO2, our land will look like Venus.
A lock that will be taken by the action of oxygen without releasing it and that will speed up the process of closing in an exponential way in a vicissive circle.
Has anyone seen direct actions so far?
Or the least sign indicating that 10,000 good men would have come to the land to plant trees and do what a green army is supposed to do, what could that be?
Of course not!
In the small brain of Abbott, sending RAAF to the Middle East may be his version of direct action.
We're moving forward, that's for sure.
When are they going to get rid of this idiot in the village?
The latest findings suggest that the growth would consume 16% of CO2 more than any climate model allows priority for replanting.
It is not logical, since CO2 is the food of plants that is the most abundant in nature, and it is necessary to preserve the whole world of flowers.
It should be said that this scientific fact has never been published.
Have you seen the army somewhere?
You're not doing anything, you're trying to get government.
The CO2 levels increase from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is increasing, your argument of plant nutrition is just a failure distraction.
And before you release your wine against the Wall Dooms, the most abundant Engrais is not CO2 but nitrogen and suffering.
The most abundant of organically generated materials may be carbon, but this does not mean that it is the most abundant grain, so Silverhead's argument is false and worthy of being reticulated.
Direct Action is a trap, because nothing can happen again.
LandCare's budget has been severely reduced and this money is now spent by the Red Army.
The problem is that instead of investing money where it was the most beneficial, it is now investing where it will receive the most publicity to raise the barriers to marginal voters.
Your contribution, instead, deserves the price of ignorance, good champion.
SilverHead, when there is too much CO2 in the air, plants produce less photosynthesis and contain less nutrients.
This means that animals and humans need to eat more and more to benefit from their nutritional benefits.
That this member of the House or of the House is evidence.
To date, he has not presented a certificate of academic rigidity which prevents him from breaking the rules of XVIIe.
For this reason, to punish him and not Thévenoud, it is incomprehensible not to harm the world, even if the regulation of the AN is not a tax treaty.
That this lady in charge of a whole case is not worthy of her honor, it seems especially like her history.
If Mitterrand had put all those who claimed Mitran...
I remember that in the debate on the feminization of names, "Academia" was exhilarated: "Let's say that Mrs the guardian or guardianship of the Sceaux" (a post that until then had never been occupied by a woman).
For magic!
"Politic arne" ...!
The sandy bacon, the back-right of the Republic, the marigot of the opulent, the table of illusions, etc. ...
But the air is supposed to be gladiators, people who take real risks, good grain, bad grain.
Qd the Phallocrate Umpist is based on the label and parliamentary regulation by violating the civilisation + elemental paraplete under the false paraplete of good ways, the punishment applies to him "the quality" for his partial perception and his misappropriation of the political arena.
The behaviour of this member is neither normal nor worthy of his position.
It's a provocation to talk about him.
To date he was unknown, he can now be proud to be known as any cancer of a primary class.
The two high-level Academy and we see that Members are sensitive to the low...
The UMP will have to wait for solutions to its internal problems and to stop causing cocaine and scandals.
The Academy has a good two, especially when we tell him what she doesn't say.
This delegation is acting as a college in the full crisis of adolescence, which is a source of provocation and whose partners, in delegation, will see the Principal to cancel college hours.
and defend it on the basis of a text that they have not even read!
Women do not even represent 15 per cent of the signatures of the UMP Members.
Mr. Judge, I call on two expert witnesses to separate a few thousand years.
That's why I like spending time with animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so obvious and appealing.
The dogs, the dolphins, the otters, the horses, they're all stupid for the simple pleasure it's looking for them.
On the contrary, it would seem that we are enjoying the majority of our 80-year-olds working, moving, and making stores.
The strange phase we have reached - we are able to multiply by two of our lifetimes, but we pass the majority in the autumn.
How did we get here?
Thanks to the illusion that it's anthropomorphism.
The game is a meta-communication.
Be careful.
It's always an illusion.
Furthermore, "communication" necessarily involves a shared symbol system.
A hard concept for you, maybe?
I imagine that the concept of inter-species communication is not compatible with your beliefs.
That's true.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate with the dog that I would like to play – basic body language.
After that, there is a variation indicating whether the game will be a race, an object to go looking, etc.
This is not difficult and there is no anthropomorphism – although I agree that we understand a lot of knowledge about animals that are being “played” while they are simply communicating.
Maybe the game isn't just "useable" (it may be, or not), it's just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber believes that "there is a principle of play based on all physical reality".
"If he had learned at school that a woman is not an object, he might not have violated it" Maybe, the hope made him live...
Thank you for giving you the opportunity to live, be healthy, and be able to respond to an article today when you had to drink the information without being able to respond to it 15 years ago.
In general, I am not against ideas, and I would even tend to be quite excited by those who appear first.
But when we see what many have been taught at school, especially among the most likely public to deliver themselves to violence against women, my enthusiasm is not the least beginning of an accompaniment.
"the most likely public to commit aggression against women" We would like to know a little more.
Or rather, no, it's good, we got it.
And yes, reality doesn't always feel the rose, even though it doesn't necessarily correspond to your plans of thought.
It's true that the dear young Neuilly and other beautiful neighborhoods don't listen very much in class.
She prefers to play on her iPhone6.
The lost young Evry too!
If the reactions were no longer reacting, Twitter would no longer propose to follow Le Pen and Sarko in the first choice.
I didn't learn anything about it at school and I never raped anyone (and that's not in my mind).
Should I like luck?
Unless I had parents to teach me certain values...
The family micro-society is learning social life.
How to learn to read life when we can't read?
And what about young socialists going to dance schools to teach gender equality?
It would be more effective than making moralistic mounts on Twitter, but it would have to come out of beautiful neighborhoods...
This campaign is a big one.
They are nothing but moral lessons, which remains the best.
It's all photogenic, but yet I want to see the bread in a hat.
There's a blog here about using his bread.
This week's article is not going to be soft.
It's not the time to make jokes about bread, my boy!
A little sensitivity!
You have made a double word game with the word "nana" to refer to a great mother.
60 books for that?
This would not even fill the stomach of a 90-year-old in a retirement home.
How is it that we pay less in the asset?
Because the quality of the experience does not necessarily measure the weight or number of calories, nor is the quality of a film or part not determined by its length.
Yes, I agree with you.
But why should good food be served in portions that would not even satisfy a minor?
It doesn't make any sense, and that's just a deliberate policy to make you buy more plates.
Of course, he should not be like that.
The Sportsman in Seasalter is at least a very good restaurant where the portions and prices are both reasonably high.
You pay more because you still eat after several mini dishes.
The more you pay, the more you have the chance to receive a child's share of art in your neighborhood.
At least they've made an effort to put their shoes on.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you tell me I should go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of many other (excellent) restaurants in York before deciding that London is the only place on Earth where you can enjoy good dishes?
It is that the Manif for all is only a Catholic and Muslim movement.
Yes, that's good: a sort of homophobic collection.
But it's not just there.
There are also atheists and humanitarianists who do not want modern "children's manufacturing" systems.
A child must not be raised in a battery raised or manufactured by a technological device.
A battery lift?
You'll get out of here.
And if you are in charge of any technical intervention in the "production", it is necessary to claim the prohibition of the PMA for heterosexual couples, that would be the merit of coherence.
I am also surprised that the manifest "for all" was not yet this logical claim to its appealing catalogue.
it is true that this is not the only cathos who manifests: other religions, Jews, Muslims, Protestants too.
However, it is also useful to remember that these different churches have been opposed to all developments in society: in 1865 (and I meet G.
Kauffmann) a bishop, Mr. Dupanloup, was violently opposed to the wishes of the gvt to allow girls at school in the name of just "the family's defense".
We're always in the same scheme.
And, more recently, the same currents have rushed to the collapse of civilization and the destruction of the family when the school became mixed.
It means that credit can be given to these people's positions.
You don't need to be catho to avoid the marketing of windows and children...
All of this is in the right line of the decline of Western civilization, increasingly challenged by others!
For me, freedom ends with the other: yes, the recognition of homosexual couples who have the right to love each other.
But it's not a question of tolerance for the child to be a furniture object.
And this is also valid for heteros in GPA demand.
I just don't get to love this guy, or to recognize his results.
If he had better control of the balloon and knew how to avoid falling moments of stupidity, he could have been a more popular player.
In addition, I am sure that any other attacker, besides Heskey, who plays so many games for England, will make a significant number of goals.
Imagine how many of Peter Crouch's goals would have been marked if more than 42 selections had been given to him in the national team...
I can't disagree, at least not categorically:) Because this article is talking about the goals he has marked, I'm not going to talk about other things he's bringing, especially to ManUtd (where RvP, Mata, Kagawa did not bring or did nothing), but perhaps that would be another reason for which he has been much more often chosen than, say, Peter Crouch.
Botham77 hoddle1 October 07 2014 12h48 Recommendation 119 This is how to criticise Rooney at this moment so we can forgive you for doing so too.
That said it is good to bear in mind that since he signed with Manchester City in August 2011, Aguero has marked 56 goals and makes 23 decisive steps in 93 matches.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney marked 59 goals and made 32 decisive steps in 96 matches.
So many people will have to find another excuse to take them to our Wazza because its states on the ground are excellent.
In addition, "Wazza" is rather a good reason for reticulating it.
I'm obliged to ask if you really look at the foot or if you think Peter Crouch A) would deserve so much choice as Rooney and B) would make so many goals if he had so many choices.
I really don't understand where the criticisms about Rooney's abilities as a football player come from.
The hardest thing is to be selected regularly in his country's team for 13 years, and to continue...
Are you seriously comparing the quality of football (not even attacking) of Wayne Rooney with those of Peter Crouch?
You're doing this without a blizzard?
There really are people in the mass.
Please note, too, for your government that Rooney has not always been the leading engine for the purposes of England during his career in the English team.
Instead, he played before he was removed, the role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind players such as Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch, mentioned above, German Defoe, and more recently Daniel Sturridge.
You wrote this out loud.
In a country where the arms port is tolerated and in a state where 71% of the people have a weapon, I find it completely schizophrene and paradoxical as a way of proceeding.
And although those in this school are not quite in agreement with the U.S. arms port authorisation!
The use of the skull is always suicide.
Stop at the corner: the girl is 5 years old.
How many gammas do they play with handguns at this age?
Is that what the killers are doing with power for so much?
Although the port of arms is in the American constitution and it has a strong influence on the culture of the country, I do not think that the rich ranges are significantly different from ours.
A little good sense and reason kept svp.
It's a disarmament procedure!
Make sure you're sure!
The information on this difference is insufficient to assess whether this little girl actually has, or does not have all, premiums for the taste of morbidity.
Are we afraid of the principle that a serial killer can no longer have a strange behavior at the age of 5 ?
If people need a psy follow-up, it's more maboules in this school than students!
Let the parents get their dog out of there: she's in danger!
All right.
Those who manage this school are obviously completely ill.
Your reaction is most relevant.
Alabama is not the most representative state of the United States, but it is part of it.
What an incomprehensible country!
About young people?
These giant blue costumes that men wear have nothing to do with a entrepreneur!
What did Alan Sugar or Richard Branson do at the beginning of their career?
In their first photos, Lord Sugar was wearing a long leather coat and Sir Richard Branson was wearing a necklace.
I can't comment too much because I've never looked at it, but it's gonna be all right if I'm tired and without a soul.
I don't have the impression that's what he meant.
Contrary, maybe?
But that's what it's like to be depressed!
You've made me.
I'd have thought a major knowledge of English would be an asset to business.
I wonder what Mr. Bjayou's doing these days.
Maybe by saying "ostraciser", he meant "aliener".
That would be logical.
No, I thought that's what he might have meant, but it doesn't always make sense.
On the other hand, if all the candidates were dressed like Carmen Miranda and Sugar was wearing a gray suit, we could assume that their intention was to distract him.
But here, no.
It would have been said that it was corrected – strange. Perhaps the whole sentence was invented!
It's not weird.
Well, who knows what he's got to say?
Of course nothing, but someone was definitely trying to quote something...
Thus, the word used in the article was well "obscise", which meant absolutely nothing.
The unemployment rate in the United States was still low in water, about 6%.
I've never seen it since 2001.
The prices of essence are low in all states.
The American economy, with Obama, is constantly being strengthened.
Who says better?
You have a very short look...
Their economy becomes "substantial"?
In order to live there at this time, I will say that the United States is approaching a little closer to the explosion as inequality is growing.
The political system is literally capable of financing electoral campaigns.
The racial tensions, police violence, mass imprisonment have an extent that we do not imagine in Europe, but Americans keep an incredible optimism in the future of their country and theirs!
How long?
This is the main question
A few days ago the English financial environment said France was lost.
Now, it's America that's at the end of her career.
Fortunately, there will always be the UK to save the world.
Another of these articles that simply forget the essential.
The level of consumption of the US economy is no longer sustainable...
These and plates on tickets would not have changed for a long time...
On the basis of the depletion of earth's resources and the growing needs of the rest of the planet.
And the weakest and the poor, a very large majority of the citizens, will "drink" or rather die.
I can't read this Farrage.
Will the Bureau finally understand that its cynic and deliberate policy to import compatible foreign voters makes it even more supportive of him?
I probably don't think so.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue to advance at any price.
LOL It was to please our American masters and their ongoing cold war with Russia.
The glorious performance of the Labour, Ed Milliband is in the spring, which is played at 617 votes.
About Clacton 11% for the Work – shocking, really exciting.
Everyone is more or less aware that the government of Blair's massive immigration policy was designed "to break the link of the right to diversity"
The Labour wins the partial election, the Tories lose the partial election in safety against ukip = The labor in crisis Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
I imagine it's the same Multiculturalism that leads to this return of manoeuvre, the pendulum has spread very far since the end of the war, and I think it will now be divided in the other sense.
Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
Lol - Secure Headquarters of the Labour, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depression Jack, you know, I know, anyone who's not in debt knows it.
Of course, the Tories have seen a lot worse, but for the Labour it's a victory for Pyrrhus.
Search for the word "Victoire" in any context, and you will see that when it is used in an argument against the word "miss", it gets the battle!
I agree, Jack, it's a winner, but she's a major.
The Labour Office should have won at least a few thousand votes.
If they record performance like that in a safe seat, can you honestly imagine them winning the majority?
Personally, I am aware of little importance that has been obtained in 2015 as the Lib Dems are not there.
You obviously don't understand how our parliamentary democracy works, do you?
Yes, I know the ices of Canada, Greenland and northern Russia.
On the contrary, I wonder if the alliance between Venus and Mars should not be considered as well?
In general, the Earth needs to be seen as more “pity ” or imperceptible than we can imagine.
Is that it?
A few little perpetrates.
Wylie, on the other hand, tells us about a " quite simple mechanism: with the disappearing of the ice on the ground floor, the pressure on the floor eased, which would give/give a) a break in the production of magma b) while facilitating its access to the surface ???
In any case, either the "float cut" or the facilitating access to the localized (more or less) surface.
It is difficult to distinguish the cause of the effect and inverse As for climate warming, it seems to me to focus rather on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
Very friendly, patricedudud, is this Volcanism affecting our environment?
Is there any effect on our climate warming, the future or the past?
Isn't it true that it's no longer boring?
When complexity cannot be resolved by simplification, we apply that simplicity and observation.
Yeah, but also, when it's nighttime, we'll see less.
Hello, the end of the last ice period was also accompanied by a stronger seismic activity, including in the "active" mountain chain on the very enigmatic continents of Canada, Scandinavia).
CB Cordiament
It is too often ignored that the earth’s crust floats on the magma and that the only crossing of the moon makes it up or down from 30 to 60 cm, in contrast, following its passage to the Zenith, as it does for ocean waters.
What makes the melting of the technical plates, as well as the marbles, more or less easily by this moving box, more than the polar shells are alluded to by the source of the ice, thus causing a change in the earth's balance to the equator, as the volume of the earth remains constant.
I admire this "human", saying the Supreme of Nature and its self-proclaimed commander, to recognizated by his stupid action on the environment that created it and which he so separates who became harmful to it, and to himself and to this environment.
And all of this to remain the supreme commander of this nature who exceeds him in the organization of his own viscers, by an invention that consists of finding all possible means to dominate his neighbour, the other, moving from collaboration, the money.
The earth’s crust does not depend on the magma, but on the earth’s maintenance, which is made up of solid rock.
I personally find it impossible to look at it.
They're proud and proud.
That reminds me of Ascent of Man de Bronowski.
Live the next part.
Beautiful Wild1 story
This reminds me of a totally genius series of 2002 called "Ape-man".
One of the best documentary series I've ever seen.
Strangely, almost no one remembers them right now.
The damage you've never done in addition to the first impression.
Your loss...
“The ice creams, our distant ancestors” You should review this passage again.
Or read about evolution.
Super program thank you Brian
I'm almost certain that the "Human History" documentary has already been carried out several times, they're still going to Ethiopia (of course)
Oh there I don't support this guy, Brian's "air miles" Cox, who's going to Ethiopia to pretend to make eyebrows in front of a brain in a bottle.
And his story...
It must be hard for you, forced to look at Coxy.
Maybe there's a group of support for you, that's what I'm saying.
I agree, everything is presented in a way that I can understand.
I loved the program, beautifully filmed.
Marcel Gauchet is a Marxist bus?
Indeed, it is the individualist identity that is foreseen today.
So she needed to be herself, in fact, so not conform.
True, but Descartes is also present at the time of the advent of individualism, and his intellectual question expresses this confusion.
But at that time these are just the premises that appear, today individualism forms society as a whole, educated or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor...
We're fine in the individualism of "mass"!
Without making an inexhaustible horizon, there is nothing related to the Cartesian approach to examining what we are going to believe, what we believe ourselves.
More than rebellion, doubt is falsified.
Making Foucault a revolutionary is an absurdity.
Many xxx-liberals refer to it and claim it.
His work on psychiatry has produced a counter-reform!
As the problem was at the level of its paranoid nom Brilliant, it blocked any progress and any reflection on the reality of the folie.
And it led to the most dramatic and reactive vision that followed: behaviorism.
Gauchet is absolutely right on this point and being anti-conformist, it is to fight this discovery.
We call Marcel Gauchet to be a defense officer of the order.
Excellent idea!
You're beautiful and rebellious. Ask some...
Blacks and rebel, to others.
Beautiful and robotic, including the most follow-up of those who see themselves rebellious in their vision.
Thank you, in any case, for his controversial polymymes to put him under the fires of the present-day Marcel Gauchet, this patient and persistent humanist, and if it is educationally clear.
David Cameron supports the increase in the tax threshold on inheritance
How many other budget cuts will be needed to pay the social benefits of this rich person?
Dave the robot will well increase its net value once it's no longer in power.
Business councils, appointments, consultation fees, a series of best sellers written by a blackman on the "serious policy" – it will be worth £100 once the left arm has passed.
Of course, he does not want tax on inheritance.
Isn't that the same lie as the last election?
And the richest are those who will certainly pay very much less taxes on inheritance due to super well-paid accounts and tax evasion programs.
This has all the signs of a Empire declaring where heritage kills innovation.
It will be £100 once he has passed the left arm.
Nothing.
He'll probably promise to increase the threshold to $1 million, which is good beyond what you say is worth.
What was your position when the Labour doubled the threshold to 650,000 for couples?
Do you also think Brown didn't think he was his own heir, or are you just a brainless tribalist?
We didn't pick it the last time, we had a coalition at the place.
You can't let it be accused of lying unless you have actually chosen it in power.
Like the rest of us, Dave won't die "normally".
Climate change and flooding will soon end, he and the others of his destiny.
His “richness ” will be as useless as that of others and will not save him or his children.
A non-compulsory income is a social advantage, especially in a country where government debt exceeds £1,000,000.
We must all be taxed in order to pay the essential services and repay debt.
I agree with you, Exidionys.
I'm not saying that discipline's teaching is useless, of course, I'm just saying it's not enough to compensate for some natural "inadequacies."
A little rational statement for the professor of mathematics she was!
Like what...
Better recruiting and training teachers is a qualitative approach.
The French political class, however, knows nothing more than quantitative approaches.
There are 2 possible answers, 1st would be to select teachers according to their ability to pass knowledge => reform recruitment modalities.
From +, she hates children because she doesn't understand them.
Not understanding them, she doesn't know how to act or react to working well => It's reduced to establish a challenge relationship that causes everyone to suffer in a clean loss => there's a need for training skills to teach.
A meeter who learns, of course.
But pedagogy is primarily an art, a natural provision and a profession before being a technique.
Working on and with human beings is not the manufacture of car parts.
The pedagogy is not even equal when we're professor of math!
"Sciences of education" cannot compensate for a lack of natural abilities.
What is lacking right now is a true vocation at bcp of those who break the prophet.
If there are gifts, pedagogy (I prefer discipline education) allows those who are less likely to make mistakes.
There are ways to address a more effective issue.
The real unknown today are the students who tell us 1/3: learning doesn't mean anything I already know what I think.
An article from Slate describes quite well the chaos situation of this return.
Let's fix the old Normal Schools of Institutors..
It ends at 3 p.m. this week, but it starts at midnight.
If that's true, it's all right with her time.
Oh, I didn't know that, thanks.
I don't think that's right.
It's been years since it started tonight.
We have this trick called iplayer and which allows us to listen to the application when we want it!
The Internet, it's pretty incredible, isn't it?
I don't have an iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB at my home, I can't really listen to radio emissions no more.
I have a type of usb adapter at two of my SKY box and who is connected to the Internet but listening to the radio on my TV I feel very complicated.
Yes, I think I've been wrong in the hours, I had to hear Richard Lester at about 3 hours.
Although this is the day of men on Radio 2, they could at least put a woman in her front hour when one of the men is on vacation or sick, at least that would please people.
They should start by getting rid of Jeremy Vine.
Its issue is of any sensitive issue that has been discussed, and it would be better on a chain like the LBC.
The lack of daily DJ women, where none of the regular sponsors, Chris Evans' morning at Simon May's release last night at work, is not a woman
It's five emissions.
So which (of these five) is most likely to be modified.
Shennan knows it very well, but don't say anything - for the moment.
Steve Wright is half-detailed these times.
Jeremy Vine may be sent to the offices as a real journalist, but breakfast keeps all the glacial air from a Daily Mail radio.
I imagine he's calm, waiting for the current team to take him or make him turn around.
I was born in Soissons in 1950!
Too late?
It's normal for these people to vote for the UN.
For 40 years, we have the same two parties that are empowered to hand over the keys of the country to the other, at least in good condition that they have not taken it.
The campaigns are very poor, even poorer than the bananas with more isolation.
It takes km to find a movie, a bar, a gym, a theater.
But since they don't burn cars, they don't attack, they don't act, they don't care about political men...
But thank you, don't talk about a department where you haven't lived.
Yes,Doctoral, these are men, sociology is good to think about them.
They have the rate of abstinence and early alcoholism very high as well...
The UN promotes human beings, culture and ignorance so much that it still has a huge potential for growth, it really needs to be bad for them not to do better...
Today, the United Nations is primarily concerned with poverty, the fear of everyday life, the fear of others, and the feeling of having no perspective.
But yes, you're right!
It's such a horrible humanity.
Fortunately, there is a lot of people like you, intelligent, cultivated and educated to save honor.
They've been looking for him.
Take the electors for c...
Here's what's going on.
Who's "they"?
In fact, there is less than one resource, less than one funding base.
Here's the comment I left on Twitter (@priya963) Listen you can't just "add and mix", women must be integrated into the development process.
What I mean here is that in many developing countries, existing standards are raised in question, such as childcare and socio-professional roles.
This allows women to recognize that they can work in the economic sphere and that is super - it is necessary.
But this is not possible without recognizing that women will then have a double flow, i.e. they will be expected to move on to work while continuing to play their role as a socio-player.
I'm not convinced of my sister.
The economy and benefits do not recognize the roles of sex.
The money is talking, and if a sex isn't at the top, then!
The benefits come from the life you eat.
What are you doing, what is the advantage, and what are you offering?
The benefits are derived from the heroism and education of children.
If there was a crime, the companies would listen.
Employment partners will never employ women aged 20 to 45.
Say good-bye to my sister.
It is very problematic that no one is talking about social work that is not paid in this article.
In some countries, the value of unpaid social work (with the majority of women) must be equal to more than 50 per cent of GDP.
Unpaid social work is not supported and is undervalued (not to mention that men do not do it enough), but it allows us to operate our societies and preserve our work.
Unpaid social work is also an important reason why many women are unable to find a true "economic emancipation" outside the home...
Thank you for all your comments - to come back to Macedonia, how can we take into account the disproportionate responsibilities assumed by women when gender integration projects are carried out?
A very practical article.
I'm sure he'll help a lot of people who need to burn a house.
The tiger is not Russian. It's only Western propaganda.
The Chinese are only responsible for the current situation and would be better placed at the negotiating table.
The right-to- self-determination tiger and the Russian soldiers are just in exercise near the border, long-term exercises planned before the current situation.
In addition, the tiger has no anti-Muslim in its possession.
You'll free the Tigris!
You made my day!
Oh yes, you do.
He just came up with the same kind of idea.
Here's a premise that's all you can find to get some separatists to join China.
If Siberia's tiger is in China, then China is in Siberia.
It's just time to fix this anomaly.
Why is an article on a tiger, a magnificent falcon and in real danger of extinction finally transformed into a betting article directed against Putin?
What's he doing?
So this is not a paper on Siberia's tiger, but a paper on the follow-up of an operation like Putin's.
When we expose ourselves to the media, we also expose ourselves to the irony of criticism.
The continual victimization return of Soviet-Poutian sympathetics.
Holland had also taken full weight with his champa without being created in the French Anti-Fraud.
At our students Alain Bougrain-Dubourg, the Holy Protector of the Great Russia is personally and physically involved in the reintroduction of this tiger.
In any case, the tiger has everything, it's bar...
It's a thing that Holland's doing.
First of all, this would seem to be a horrible consensual idea.
However, on the basis of the article, it would be said that it is both an answer to a real problem - emergency dental subsidies - and effective.
So it's hard to find something to do.
And if only 53% of this sample were brushing teeth before and 73% after, it's a little empty to complain about parentalism.
After all, there's no one who can break his teeth!
In fact, complaints appear to be related to the fact that they are intended to be addressed to the complainants and that this confirms a negative stereotype.
But if this is true, then this is not a justified criticism.
Belenda Smith, of the Canterbury Regional Health Committee, said that the Department was concerned about the number of emergency dental subsidies offered by the Department of Labour and the Ministry of Social Development to young unemployed adults.
On a media level, there would be better ways to implement it, I imagine.
But he seemed reasonably well thought out.
There's a misunderstanding about breaking your teeth.
If you brush them after having a good wine, it can damage the leg of anamel.
If your toothbrush is old and rigid, it can cut the gene and cause inflammation.
And I remember an issue on the Guinness Book of Records where someone had tried to break his teeth the longest time and the Guinean judges at the time had strongly advised him to do so because of the adverse effects of a frequent and prolonged tooth brushing.
' For the first time, it's very expensive.
It seems to me to be an experimental concept that's broken.
The simple fact that it is voluntary for this study will have changed the habits of participants who knew that tooth brushing would be studied.
That is why most behavioral studies include tricks such as double-blind, witness groups, etc.
There is no way to reject these results on the programme itself.
Assuming that these texts are sent to every young person who perceives social benefits, there are two things that are different from this test: 1) They are not volunteers, and 2) they do not return information on the times when they break or do not brush their teeth (slightly wrong results in the air by people who give their results according to perceived expectations).
Is there any side effects at the epigenetic level?
Studies (Pr. Lyonnet) showed that the maternal environment (including uterine) could have effects on genetic heritage, not in the genes, but in the expression of genes, and that these inheritances could be transmitted to the next generation.
Does the Utreus flu affect this phenomenon?
The trend is similar to a sort of flu.
There are likely consequences, but as long as we don't want to be a perfect clone of ourselves, is there a problem first?
I think it's going beyond the limit of rationality.
The desire to be a mother and a father must not be forced to go further without being concerned about ethics, risk taking, for mother and for her baby.
Not the medicine is not all powerful, it is not unlimited and yes it is unfortunate and painful to accept that all women will not have the child, or children they wish to have.
That's nothing, absolutely nothing, to see with the train.
But let people, women, others, have their bodies, their notion of love that can go to risk and manage your little witnesses to you alone, just in your little pants to yourself.
of their "confiding" this magical bag because they had this wonderful moment of pregnancy.
Why would I keep him strictly in my safe safe if he could still give him love.
The current tense circumstances make PR FRYDMAN cautious about its communication, but if "we" agreed to reflect, "we" would admit that this is only the bag and not the genetic material involved.
What you're going to put us as an anti argument: cf here these reactions all the males carefully....
Marjane, there's nothing wrong with any organ donation.
I've been a plasma donor for years, it's not entirely anadine.
I was registered as a spinal cord (I have never been selected because the selection is very strict and that is understood both for the recipient and for the giver), it is a real operation.
Now as a man, I wouldn't be able to judge in one sense or another or take part in this gift, but I'll listen to women talking.
@Margane: Indeed, it has nothing to do with it, and it strengthens the act of love that it involves.
Giving a queen to a member of her family who needs it has nothing to do with it, and this is done!
Please don't combine Messi v Ronaldo.
It's low.
I agree, we don't need that.
Most of all, there's no more real competition...
Ronaldo is the best athlete.
Messi is the best football player.
Deportivo has become a yoyo club.
They're too good for the Second but they don't have the League standard.
Rivaldo was not part of the winning team.
Thank you for correcting me.
But Rivaldo played well for the Deportivo before going to Barcelona.
Ronaldo who continues to do everything to beat all the memories of the goals of the Real Madrid this season so that he can then return to Old Trafford this summer with a calm conscience...
I don't think so.
I think Ronaldo will finish his career in Santiago Bernebou.
I think you want to talk about the international oil investment company?
I'd look at it on a fake connection so I can't tell you much if it's not that Valencia has been well defended and without counting the property, they deserve to win.
I was afraid that the ground environment wouldn't go too fast, but they played well.
The game of Parejo in general becomes better.
A delicate criminality widely claimed but saved to a fair title by Diego.
A hot-tempered Mestalla and this has not to be hard for the Atletico bus to be bombed.
That's interesting.
A complete article, signed by young researcher Amandine Marshall, “On the origins of the mummification, ” well illustrated, appeared in the magazine Archeologia 524 of September last.
It is good to have arguments to confirm and date what becomes intuition.
Not surprisingly, before we get complicated, we've got simple things to do.
All science progresses through small steps.
And the woman's organ that was so preserved to her?
Passionate!
Good morning and thank you for your tickets.
He seemed to me to read some time ago that a black baby girl had been discovered in the current Libya and that this discovery had opened up new horizons, including geographical and temporary (I think I remember that it was 1,000 years ago in the first known African mummies).
Do you have any information about this?
Thank you for your advance.
She's a bit of a reader.
These may not be pollutions of modern times.
Would the desert at the time not be far away now?
Why don't you imagine plants like the cannabis pushing to the place where there's only sand now?
We knew the song.
And it is enough for a European scholar to say, even without any proof, that it is a scientific truth: the Egyptians and the Africans today have never invented anything like it.
But the song does not tell us who are the inventors of African inventions in Africa.
If this is not and always "from his bad predecessors."
You should read the article.
Here's an article written by neoliberal quicks of the free market and which deals with the mobility of people and for the mobility of goods.
I think there are other people who are approaching Ebola and who the Spanish government thinks of us, so that we don't give ourselves a bad image and protect tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But they may remain silent to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same thing about tourism, but governments in particular (e.g. those in Spain and the United Kingdom) tend to protect the interests of businesses rather than those of people.
Stop, do not hesitate to call your local MP and complain about lack of transparency.
Even though I think the government here is just a bunch of connards, good for nothing and corrupts, like Madrid is not a very tourist place, I doubt this is their biggest concern.
What are you waiting for?"
(with all due respect and compassion for the nurse and her colleagues), since tourism is one of the only things that enable millions of people in this country to keep their heads out of the water, I would say, yes, it is important.
If they were to fully repatriate the missionaries, I don't see why they couldn't send them to a military base and take care of them there in a field hospital instead of in the capital, for example.
Rajoy had a mission to decompose the Spanish health service, privatizing nationalized hospitals especially in Madrid, which is the basis of his power, until the courts intervene.
It's nothing but a right-wing lawyer in public relations like Cameron, and like Cameron, I think he's wrong at the next elections.
To be just towards Cameron (I know it's not easy here) socially he is far from his right and would find his place in the right religious crowds in America.
Now he must sing the praises of the hospitals he had come down before to try to achieve his goal of protecting Spanish tourism.
I'm sorry, but you can't really compare the Torah or any other European right to the Spanish right.
These are separate cases, believe me.
The Spanish Government thinks of almost everything it has to do with it.
It's not as if someone could accuse you of spreading information.
So you have tangible evidence to support this idea?
This section of the Guardian is called The comments are free.
Thank you, Mr. Supiot.
Without putting the work at the centre of production and the economy with its rights and guarantees, we will not go out.
Excellent article but especially fascinating reactions on the forum.
Many of TPE bosses - PME seems to read The World to take time to condemn Mr.
Let's move on to the early intellectualism of the environmental age.
A law professor at the French College seems unable to know the labour market unless it is a Nobel Prize for Economics and proposes to liberalize it completely
It was so much better before, it was true when Dr. Villarmé noticed the work of children aged 8 at 10 a.m. every day, when the Canuts were taking a view of a collective convention signed.
Oh, good old time...
Your reaction is equally fascinating by your knowledge of the TPE pattern!
Its purpose is not to know the right in all its fields, but to manage and produce.
Four manually registered amounts on my youth payroll, more than 100 information today!
Here's an example, we could quote a lot more, which illustrates the constant flow of constraints, which is imposed without any measure of consequences, and which engulfs the small business.
Your paper would have been very useful if you wrote it as an expert and not as a Sorbone client.
In order to break the archipelago's archipelago argument of the French Labour Code in relation to the winter, a serious university student would be immersed in Swiss texts and would have compared the number of official texts, then comments (the absence of these last ones may mean that Swiss laws are more understandable than ours).
By comments in a Code, whether it is work or not, the case law is aimed, in particular...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is responsible for applying the laws when a employee is licensed, for example...
Who's that complicated?
Do you find that the rules of law (laws, jurisdiction, conventions, contracts) are applicable to the work and trade of unsustainable obstacles?
What's he doing?
How hard is that?
Pullmann "The art has practically been immunised against the criticism of Mrs.
Is this guy still on the street?
There must be a time when new revolutionary absurdities are making the criticisms...
For each article on Ai Weiwei that I have recently, you are part of the first three comments that complain about its popularity.
Take care of yourself!
Let's go see, the choice is not missing in the world of art.
If China can produce new artists who are not the speakers of the Communist Party, the world will be interested.
Yes, GhenisCan is probably a troll of the Chinese government.
I think China produced a lot of good contemporary artists.
Those who are the passwords of the Communist government are not appreciated in the West, and those who are not the passwords are not as well connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those among you who think Ai Weiwei's art is a kind of fraud, that's what you're talking about.
Thanks for that, you come to ruin my breakfast.
I'm sorry, but I had to expose it at all costs (without making a bad word game).
It's the guy who exhales old ceramics and calls it art, right?
There's art, and then there's vandalism trying to attract attention.
True artists are different.
A beautiful artist.
His father is also a non-bad poet.
His father was a well-known poet in China.
Exhibited during the Cultural Revolution.
KARSENTY DEMISSION This gentleman is reluctant to take an election order from the extremists on any board (including Zionists) must be set apart.
Philippe Karsenty and his theories of the conspiracy, which have been worth a number of judicial convictions, are both shameful to Israel and to the Mary Mary of Neuilly.
He does not represent either one or the other.
Philippe Karsenty is fighting against the truth alone, marginally.
WHAT RESSEMBLE IS FOR
What is it about to do the Mary of Neuilly against Philip Karsenty, who employs a journalist and his family, and who publicly calls for this citizen to attack?
Crime Apology?
I can't find Neuilly on my card?
Is it a new administration that holds these new privileges ?????
This type of care is needed, as is the case with Ulcan Chelli, both of them in the theory of the antijuy/anti-Israeli compact and whose sources are perfectly identical to those of their most angry tractors.
As many people believe in all political decisions to see the hand of the "synastics" (the term which makes sense to disappear, because of his abuse), both there, as the LDJ or even the CRIF, believe in any criticism, even banal, an object anti-semitism "which is not without remembering the most dark hours of our history because it is still the heart of my good lady who was believed to have returned to Russia in the 19th century!"
Note that Karsenty's incredibly stupid theories on Charles Enderlin's report are even more stupid than those on September 11th.
And God knows that the theories of the conspiracy on September 11 are of a very broken beta.
And this guy has political responsibilities, it's extremely worrying.
To clarify my analogise with the theory of the 11th September summit, we speak of cognitive dissonance on how to deal with the subject.
Totally blinded by a totally colorful truth, having spent too much time, spent too much money to steal it, it is not enough to accept this theory to detach it (as in the case of extreme religious).
If there is a logical and inexhaustible departure in advance, the end justifies all means, even lies, which is a combination but does not seem to disturb the mission.
You advise to pay attention and not put the whole world in the same panel, but that's what you do for September 11th.
There is still a lot of unanswered questions for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudiens/consortes do not seem to be forced to answer.
There are actually very interesting theories, but the official theory is also, at least on a few points.
Oh no more is no role right now...
Health NGOs and public health portals find that the results of the study are widely in favour of their awareness-raising efforts.
And, of course, they will need more subsidies to follow!!
Just as smoking was socially acceptable 50 years ago and is now recognized for what it really is, alcohol will also know its time of judgment where the real damage it causes in our society will be exposed.
More than expect everyone to attack me now...
Well, it's easy to enjoy saying tricks such as "excessive consumption of alcohol is rising", but what demands (a little) more effort is to give real facts.
I'm sorry if you think it's an attack - you're gonna drink a glass and you're gonna hold?
It's better to risk it than to endanger my mental health by neglecting me.
The government ends the pleasure when it costs him money.
Here are other alarming advice based on mistrust statistics.
Two average wines per day is at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first quote seems to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers, but the second implies that it is more or less safe.
Perhaps the Cancer Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council should come together (about one or two wines, but not more than three) and give us a number on which they agree - whether it is justified or not.
Now, we're gonna pay them back, like the smokers!
They're already doing it - soon this will be the tree!
My father didn't drink or smoke, and cancer took him to 64 years.
So I'm going to continue drinking my two red bottles on Fridays and Saturday evenings (and the other evenings when my wife isn't there).
Why is it that the Cancer Council encourages children to go to places where alcohol is served? It is an old age that the Cancer Council has deliberately ignored.
What is not related to a risk of cancer in our day???
Requins don't touch cancer - they eat anything but they're not good company.
Requines can capture cancer - skin cancer.
Charlie Whiting's incompetence has been a recurring subject for many years.
Refuse to run when we can run and run together.
Totally agreed.
Whiting is Bernie's blessing.
Both of them destroyed the F1 under security.
Let's hope it gets better than Schumi or at least Wendlinger's accident in 1994.
Absolutely agree with you, but attention to point 1: this is not the F1, but the circuit authorities who refused to advance the departure to operate TV broadcasting networks.
That's right, +1.
I just want a quick and quick return to Jules Bianchi!
Brazil 2003, Europe 2007, the incidents that failed to take place between landfills and f1 were free of charge warnings.
We knew that one day it would happen, and Jacques Laffite, in particular, said it for years.
How the hell did the running organization and the FIA allow these manuals without leaving the safe car?
I cannot accept that we are calling for the risks of the weather or the lack of chance when we have not prevented the predictable.
But that accident was him.
It should also be said that there was a yellow cloth, which does not mean not only "a ban on crossing the area" but has the first intention of signaling a danger.
It's not embarrassing, it's happy for the family that should be in front of the TV.
Even under the yellow hat, the pilots will just lift their feet.
Under changing conditions, the vibration can be much more narrower to the rear and the pilot, believing to reach enough margin, can even be “cut down” as compared to a normal speed.
Well, we're caused in the void there, until we haven't seen the images, we can't issue an opinion.
I don't see how much that changes.
Did he get hurt?
According to the CBC, no injury has been reported.
The CBC showed the information this morning before this happens, which makes me ask what caused the accident.
It's hard to believe there's still balls where we have to keep it 24 hours a day.
I don't think there were people injured because Canada is almost empty.
There may have been animals that had been damaged, such as eggs, raccoons, etc.
I hope it's irony.
Some parts of Vancouver have the strongest population density in North America and Toronto's agglomeration is at least six million inhabitants.
In the Saskatchewan campaign, trains do not go as far as internship and these types of trains often cross popular urban areas.
Nearly every Canadian city is crossed by a railway line, and trains fail very, very often in one day.
In addition, as roads often follow water courses in regions where lakes, rivers or oceans are present, they also go to densely populated areas, because people always want to live near water.
Also, all rail traffic across the center of a city because it was a central element of the original construction of road lines here.
You may have tried to be a thief, but there is a huge potential for railway accidents in Canada.
Mansbridge made a report about this last night, really shocking.
You obviously didn't read the article on derailment and the explosion of a train in a city of Quebec that killed 47 people?
In fact, you're partly right.
The city of Vancouver was a port city just before the railway.
That said, when the railways were built, they passed through the centre of the established communities because it was the most direct and central road.
It may be that Canadian National Railways Company employees should attend the next Conference on Dangerous Products in Calgary, Canada on 2 and 3 December 2014.
NC employees are long trained in the transport of dangerous products.
This article, like many comments, is about the primary religious question: a religion is a revealed truth and for its believers it could not exist for other truths.
The problem is here, and the performances of the theologians do not only strengthen this fact, but what good is it to discuss the sex of angels?
"God said, it's good - it's bad" > It's not compatible with democracy, it's called the dictatorship (variant: theocracy).
Said of a leader (a Muslim country but not important): "But without religion, how do you want to have people?".
In other words, obey the shepherd priest Rabbi's imam and pray, it's better!

Yes, that's what Voltaire and others thought, there's Robesierre in some way trying to establish a cult of the Supreme Being.
But our oligarchy also has its cults: the strong euro ( rather at this moment ) or the free market ( Passively supported by the State when it needs to reflow ) , etc .
Great ideas resulting from religious developments.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and profanity.
Where the rationale emerges, the religion is at the back and expresses itself in the schism.
Religion is born as the ideological support of the State, and the gods served the ambitions even if they also brought forms of protest.
The theology between loyalty in the form of revelation and adaptation to the weather did not know the question.
Fantasy is often described as a bad interpretation of "sacred texts".
This does not resist the examination of these texts that are filled with explicit prejudices to the hatred of the offender.
Rather, they are the moderate religious (and fortunately the most) who "read the texts badly" and hold only what concerns humanity and common values throughout humanity, atheists and believers.
For me, fanaticism is the evil and evil application of passages of sacred texts from their context.
Thus, some verses of the Koran calling for the killing of “mecreants,” “unbelievers,” “hypocrites,” “jufies” or “Christians” are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable if not read some verses above or below stating that these executions are justified only in cases where Muslims are attacked, killed and in a situation of legitimate defence.
on Yves Petit: "on the "foulard", it is a religious requirement that makes the almost unanimity of the "wise" today.
There are idiots everywhere.
The only positive point to draw from this is that it caused a general condemnation.
Especially in Australia.
Aren't you guilty of the same damage that he showed in the clip?
Néanderthalian gang is surprised and hypersexual.
They've taken mankind away enough!
What they have brought us out of the world with our neighbors, For life, Summer Bay, Paul Hogan, Crocodile Dundee, Young Einstein, Angry Anderson - Suddenly, Mental as Anything - Live It Up, Danni Minogue, Razorback, Baz Lurman, Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, Bee Gees, Shane Warne, Yahoo Serial, Ian Thorpe, Kylie Minogue, Men at Work, Hugh Jackman, the Devil of Tasmania and this satanic Skippy!
An insult to our intelligence, that's what he gave us!
If you tear your eyes off the TV for a while, you will see that Australia has a rich cultural heritage, starting with paintings in caves and on stone made by its indigenous peoples, who are still a source of inspiration for modern artists today.
And then there's Sydney Opera and a national opera company that produced wonderful singers such as Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
The Australian film produced films such as The Story of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
The outstanding Australians include Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Kate Blanchett.
The only thing that hates your intelligence is you and your ignorance.
Russell Crowe is New Zealand, and the Bee Gees were English.
Your intelligence really needs to be insulted!
Let me have another opinion.

But you don't know yet that Kastals is just a little Moscow telegrapher who has nothing to do with his days.
We leave him for a month and when we return he's in charge of the same rooms.
The almost total deaths of 331 since the ceasefire are civilians of Donbass victims of military bombings, due to elements not controlled by Kiev.
The presentation of hypocritically suggested responsibilities in the article without ostentatiousness until clearly designated separatists are in the world's Ottoan line that does not hesitate to reverse facts and responsibilities in order to maintain the felicity of the pro-European neonates who courageously face Russians

If I fully understand your concern about the wicked are Ukrainians and Russian Stalinists will not be a little Communist by chance.
Extract of the (very long) document you read about MH17: "This ticket is absolutely not intended to say that pro-Donetsk resistors are innocent".
The Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation said that Ukraine was responsible.
From the propaganda?
In Alexandre Castals, where do you have these details about the macabre?
From the Ukrainian army (she unfortunately loses soldiers almost every day, according to her)?
Uncontrolled elements (possible to say anything)?
Let's go! Let's go!
Alleyeyeyeyeeeeweeweeweeung Hungary!
I'm telling you this as a Romanian citizen.
From Transylvania, with a Hungarian-born woman, on the contrary.
That said, I can't support the Piturca team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the power in place that has not stopped denouncing the Romanian football until the pathetic level he has now reached.
They formed a network that produced the "Cooperativa" that decided before the start of the season which teams would win the championship, which teams would be in Europe, which would be rejected, and which would whitemail money at its throat, mainly by selling players who were well-adverted.
Gica Popescu, the former captain of Barcelona, was dealing with the above-mentioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (about a million euros), then paid them, but, apparently, he was advised by his lawyers, refused to admit his mistakes to the court (which would have cost him an innocent sentence), and was arrested for 3 and a half years.
The trial was also worth prison for the Becali brothers, four club owners, the Steaua manager Mihai Stoica, and Popescu, for crimes related to football.
George Becali also feels a pain for trying to do (and then dissimulate the facts) a team to beat us (CFR Cluj) in the final match of the champion, to win the title and win the champion's jackpot.
The team he tried to do was our neighbors at Cluj, University.
We won 1-0 at their stage, a result that allowed us to be the first champions of Cluj, while they were rejected.
I'll always enjoy this time.
The dissimulation of this corruption attempt involved, among other things, Piturca, who identified as a false document that implied that the money that the police had confiscated in Cluj was related to a sale of land.
So this uneducated, uneducated, idiot, liar and liar don't represent me, and will never do it.
The Hungarians are just a bunch of nationalists today.
You might think that after the last time they broke down shops and store vineyards, and where they burned racist banners in their streets, they couldn't have tickets this time, but not.
I thought Neil Lennon was about to re-examine Al-Ittiqad.
Wherever it ends, it will be a disappointment, after Stockport County has rejected it.
Super article.
If it were Sarkozy who had done it, we'd have heard the left ear cry like a big disease.
But as it is the Dutch kindness, friends of unionists and small people, we understand a little protest, but all low
That is why the economic environment sometimes prefers that a party claiming to be left is placed in power.
These are the bankers who have financed Obama's victory, and they have not had enough of their investment!
"the absurd idea that most employers are not looking for work" LOL (not how)
Should employment be generalised by control of beginners in 2015?
I hope that in the crowd, the fish pool, it will also generalise the absolute control of the so-called plutocrats, bankers, kleptocrats, tax evacuators, volors, and other malandrins.
Do you know how to make a phrase without the words bankers or plutocrats?
You look very proud of your garden every time.
That's true when we're in class: we treat the people of foreign and toothless people.
In each new period of unemployment, these are dozens and dozens of candidates that I address to employers who are most often not even charged with receipt, it was automated.
It is also the total lack of follow-up or support from the Polish Employment Party.
To conclude, I will add that the "socialist" pattern of this government appears to me as an insult to the memory of Jaurès or Mendés France.
Have we read here an article from the buried candard?
We learn that a driver can stay several months without news from his agency, but that he must continue looking for jobs by his own means.
It is learned that controls have enabled people who for more than half of them no longer touch unemployment.
So we're asking how we can control people we've never seen.
We are asked what sanctions are a radiation for anyone who has no access to employment services or unemployment allocations.
And if we can admit that this reform will allow for more radiation, we ask ourselves what will help recruits.
"It is learned that a driver can stay several months without news from his agency, but that he must continue looking for jobs by his own means" In fact, it is embarrassing.
The question must be asked, why are these countries in the EU when the authorities are clearly unable to defend Europe's equal ideals?
Is it not as if the Spanish or Italian authorities had made a big deal about racism in the foot no more?
Should we throw them out of the EU?
The EU was of economic origin only and should remain.
The aim is not to be a "police of thought".
The EU is a peaceful project.
It doesn't make any sense about an economic plan.
That is probably the reason why Britain will soon leave the EU: it is Europe's most innocent society.
What equality???
Eastern European teams are constantly being held by corrupt mafia arbitrators who are the U.S.A.
The best solution would be that all the East would leave this lucrative organization and create the dream.
At least we'll look at your football.
This anti-crisis crossing is just a screen to cover injustice and corruption!
No, that's not true.
Money and trade rather.
The European ideals of equality?
What, then, is Europe wrong to let the United Kingdom enter?
The Uefa should have appealed to them to join the Blaster comedy and his men.
That's been happening for a few years, and I don't care.
Guardian shot two or three days ago:
Would he expect to see small symmetrical phrases back, just a story to keep the polymic?
Whatever it is, it is a fact that every small event towards peace, there are, there are and there will be people working to throw oil into the fire.
The decoding would mean that the Western states are against a "Palestinian State", that they are pro-Israeli, and that this alone explains that they have never done anything against the Israeli State.
The decoding would mean that, in order to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian issue, it would have to act against the Israeli State of the same armed armed forces occupying the territory of the occupying Power.
Instead of creating a Jewish state in Palestine to the destruction of an Arab population that was nothing in Shoah in 1945, it was more reasonable to see the Bavière of its German inhabitants (which they were able to do with Shoah) to replace them by surviving Jews.
It would have been fair, the Germans had nothing to complain about, and Europe would have kept millions of educated, entrepreneurial and dynamic residents.
Mr., take the example of Western Sahara colonization...
That Morocco is the colonialist, that's evidence!
But as for Israel, it is also necessary to question the history, its allies and its support for truth.
Colonialism, whatever it is, has never been alternative, we agree.
So stop your pirates to support Israel as a colonizer.
The Gaule was colonized by the Romans but currently, there is no discrimination among the descendants of the Romans, Gaulois or others.
In Palestine, there is discrimination based on origin.
In addition, the State of Israel is defined as that of a "Jewish people" in which no non-Jewish people can participate.
The Israeli State discriminates against non-Jewish people, where they are happy.
Conclusion: In order to resolve the conflict, it is necessary to break up with the evils that oppose Jews and non-Jewish.
In Maghreb, some people have even been baptized in the name of their first status by this lifesaving civilization!
Two facts that must be ignored.
Firstly, the European Zionist project (colonization of Palestine) involved the deposition of Palestinians, which was therefore an intra-Palestinian project, the solution needed to break with Zionism.
Second, evil is a political ideology.
Uruguay has been missing since the start.
Their eternal result will give them what they kill their fingers.
He should start his rehabilitation with small shoes.
I hope he hasn't lost the appetite of the game.
We tolerate so many subjects, including racial injuries and physically difficult tacs in football, but Suarez was punished too long.
I'd like to see him come back to England, no matter what the cops say.
Yes, I hate all those moratoriums.
The football is a contact sport where the balls exist and, therefore, players will get hurt.
The fact that his teeth are in the flesh of an enemy to have the advantage does not ensure his place in the game.
A rugbyman was suspended for 80 matches to have performed a similar gesture.
It's now the third time Suarez does this.
If you kill someone at work.
What would be the consequences for you?
I knew someone was gonna die.
If you're dyslexic, I'm sorry.
I'm slightly dyslexic.
I'm sorry for this mess with two balls.
I'm afraid he had to come back to play with his teeth.
All these words games on Suarez are losing their killer.
I failed to kill the hammock.
An essential condition for a good school course is respect for students of their teachers and school institutions.
This works if parents are concerned about this respect for their children.
Parents communicate this respect more easily if they also feel respected by their children's teachers and school.
In the good institutions of those who make progress in their students, parents are considered partners, and not emm.
One can believe that it is the professor who should do all the work (learning, education, learning respect, limits, living together short) It is for parents to do at least 50% of the table.
But it's no doubt easier to take them to school.
Mistake on parents is not operational.
No one really cared about them.
From now on, the action will be limited.
On the contrary, the school institution could have a lot of things.
Operational solutions are resident there.
The actors (profess, hierarchy and department) would need to play their role there and do not continue to be affected.
We can disband a group that is struggling to relaunch it, not the families.
Don't talk about teaching.
It is true that communication courses allow for change.
It's like being teachers, but we forget the first role of the school.
Transmitting knowledge.
And if it requires parents there, the school ensures the instruction of their children.
What is the Minister who will put in place what was called the Public Instructions?
Next article: little information, partial and destructive reflections.
Are you really looking forward to an intelligent comment on this beauty of the east whales?
It's beautiful, it's clear, but I think it's rather Willoughby, and so on the North Coast...
Sloppy Joe doesn't understand the numbers.
He refuses to accept the facts.
Not surprisingly, we had a budgetary emergency.
Let him fall and the economy will rise immediately.
Hunters Hill, in fact.
true care
That's it.
A little Aloysius.
His electorate is the seat of Sydney North.
Indeed a beauty from the North coast!!!
Well, if British BBC TV viewers wanted to compare the non-conservative governments of our two countries, they would clearly conclude that they were led by the Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers.
It is for a Greek, today. :(
Yes, but his good leader let him go on his hunger regularly.
You would rather be funny also if you wake up one morning and realize that you will never have the role of Prime Minister and that all these life-long and legitimate benefits will remain beyond your scope.
Pauvre Joe.
It's really pathetic.
He tried half to present a budget and then he gave up.
At least he doesn't threaten to hurt anyone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new ship.
It will be able to order, without gas turbines, in a distant country and to request State aid.
And as she can do lobbying, don't be afraid of the result.
And so bad for the job in France that she has nothing to do, she who carries legumes is always ready to drop when their company has losses on the markets, outside, including...
it's just because their lobbying didn't work but the order was cancelled.
If the company had obtained the duration or arrangement for marpol, there is no doubt that the project would have been completed.
Well, to know if it's okay or not and how BF will comply with the law anyway, it would be nice to know that "the world" thinks about it!
The company Brittany Ferries is held by the legumes bretons.
Those who burn the centers of taxes and drought.
They want state aid.
That they didn't seem to me at least normal.
And as far as the army of a ship under the French metropolitan fleet is 30% more expensive than any other civilized fleet, it is normal to wait for a break of State power.
Or we are condemned to tolerate British monopolies on the market.
That's the choice.
Eternal French problem that considers its maritime faces as tourist destinations, and not as areas of activity, where people are sometimes different from the average Parisian.
This difference is paid every day, lack of investment, short-term wishes.
One of the reasons why Britain has to find its sovereignty.
That's it, and then they'll create the breton pavilion with equipment exclusively made of pure bretons.
With this, of course, they're going to lower costs significantly...
You heard me.
Unfortunately, that's what we're waiting for from the BBC now.
They have always hated everything about the prog, so it is not surprising that they have chosen to go beyond the sole career of Hackett, which has always been closer to the spirit of Genesis of the 70s than those of the other members of the group.
Hackett was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for AC/DC.
If you don't understand how important it was for the sound, you don't really understand their music.
To tell the truth, they hardly mention Gabriel’s work alone anymore.
I do not think that the BBC can be accused of "hating everything related to the prog, because they have been distributing a documentary of an hour and a half on one of the largest prog groups that ever existed.
I haven't seen the documentary yet, but it's a film about the Genesis group, not about the only projects of its members.
As for Hackett's sole career, which would be "near closer to the Genesis spirit of the 1970s", I disagree.
Hackett no longer has the right to take the road, to play a set of Genesis songs on which he had several degrees of participation and to claim to have an affinity with Genesis that David Gilmour has no right to collect a half-time demo bag and call it a Pink Floyd album.
Oh, wait...
I think Steve Hackett's asking for nothing more than a fair representation, but he didn't receive it.
Curious feeling, the first solo album of Bank, is absolutely great, and in fact in the spirit of Genesis of the 70s.
They've gone beyond Hackett's sole career because, we're honest, she's afraid.
Yes, it is one of the best prog groups, but would the documentary have been made if they had not been successful in the 1980s?
I have not always seen the BBC broadcast a long documentary on groups such as King Crimson and Gentle Giant who have a story that is as interesting but lacking the popular attraction Genesis has.
Good notes.
I'd say even if the BBC has always "always" hated the fact that it's done the progressive music in time.
A person with a personal interest creates a “prejudice” : of course.
A little more interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
Chances are absolutely wonderful.
If the death penalty is an attempt to double a horrible act by another horrible act (including sometimes innocents), then it is an exciting success.
There will always be a difference between a convicted criminal and those who kill him.
The criminal has committed his act since his misinformed understanding of society and its rules.
Those who kill him from vision and reflection make him the fairest and wisest of a society.
I mean, they have no excuse.
They're indefinable.
Yes, we understood your point of view, the first time already.
This is exactly where the difference lies, Mr. LeClos.
There must be a very different spirit from the community of mortals to play violence.
That's what the criminal has been doing since his wrong understanding of things.
But this is also the result of pain, hatred, revenge among the neighbors of the innocent victim: a false understanding that will never prevent those who wisely decide the death of others since their health and just reason for their pedestal.
However, to try to balance the analysis, we could also claim that the death sentence has often been subjected to wild violence, which he has been able to deal with, against people who are primarily loved, who have made it free of charge.
The neighbors of these unfortunate victims will eventually experience their pain caused by the disappearance of the one who was the storm, sometimes the torturer, the loved one and who keeps their nights.
We don't hate their relief.
Thank you Emilio for this thought I find very fair.
The article is strong and loving.
About Marc Asnin, he shows great intelligence.
The one in the heart.
That's certainly what I've been reading for a long time.
However, it would be expected to read stories from another time, old things, that the history barbaria would be forgiven, and then the dates that lie, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I don't really think Philip Roth is so great.
Similar to the other two "Amerior Romances" mentioned here.
Roth, Pynchon and De Lillo are all surprised.
I thought you stopped white, man.
What's that smell?
Roth is great, better than De Lillo or Pynchon.
And Roth is almost better than this criminal Bellow, who received the price.
Perhaps the Nobel laureate of this year's judges decided that if we had to have an American laureate, we could still have a [read] racist.
Munro's very good, too.
They produce all of the "geneine novels" as if it were a literary kind.
His homonym Joseph against...
What have you got?
How many DeLillo books do DeLillo's anti-DeLillo have?
I've never finished Underworld, but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Do you have The Body Artist?
News like "Human Moments in World War III"?
White Noise?
The first lighter novels, lighters, smaller ones, and their dialogues are also great.
I don't know if I'm going to end a day underworld.
I just know that if I meet someone who claims to live in the same world as I do and have DeLillo's books enough to reject his writer's talent, I can only fear that his favorite novelist is Tony Parsons.
Why would he have a conflict??
It's of simple interest.
It was a humane treaty, "the law", not a request for definition.
Between the text and the mind, it appears here that the lady has acted in the SON only interested, and not in the institution she represented, that we are asked what the term "conflict" is going to do there.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope she'll be very sweet!
Yes, State services are very practical: either they prevent a dynamic entrepreneur from creating the value, or they have not prevented the danger.
After we understand that French employees are not dynamic and are only looking for peace.
The waterproof areas that become constructive on the next day when a large construction program will be launched, are classic, and not just on a low-cost basis.
Look at alluvial beaches near the rivers.
We were told that "from our day, there are no more floods thanks to the regulatory barriers."
Now, we need to expand the retention lakes up and cross the slopes.
But this will be due to state services, of course...
The benefit on the ground, on the whole of promotion?
On the ground.
So 6 million euros.
Is it clear, here, the interest?
Sort the calculator and you're going to dream of the life you could have in place at Ms. Babin, 1st Deputy UMP of La Faute on Sea and former president of the Urbanism Commission, who allows you to build!
The 2 mothers of Sarkozysmant Triomphant are old and real estate.
I'm left and not of any sympathy with Sarko, but svp, not of low political or low cuts of all Azimuts, we're not in a battle of powerful boulevards.
I wonder if the figures involved in these recent mergers were also involved in these incidents.
The U.S. girls are undercover criminals.
The U.S. is a dirty hole.
So what the hell do you think you're doing, you?
The United States is not a fucking hole.
Yes, the American girls are dressed because of the raccoons they've been dealing with every day.
Of course none of them will ever do anything, but the girls "come to get rid of them because they're racist".
There's a good excuse.
Racism is endemic to the US, and unfortunately it is an incident like that to force people to see the problem closer.
Your generalization reveals a deep ignorance of the US...
You're ignoring him here.
Good flicks must denounce corrupt racist flicks.
VENDEZ-LES!
Do the calculations.
This kind of open racism isn't here.
Is it the first time you're participating in a conversation?
This is not a conversation, you are accused of being ignorant while it is clear that you do not play anything - from many sources (US sources) have noted the permanent problem of racism in the United States (not from oscisive speculation).
It is very likely that you underestimate the extent of the problem and do not appreciate the extent of the tension on this subject at the moment.
As a result, the border between public service and private security for power and privileges, which has never been very robust, becomes even more insignificant.
Wall Street finances the NYPD in various ways, where the treatment is carried out by Occupy there.
What surprises me is the birth of some and I am shocked by the false birth of VA and others.
And where do you think research journalists find their information?
On the Internet?
They will question the responsible, speak to them, cause them to be trusted.
That Man goes to the Elysée has nothing really surprising.
Then, what counts is recovery, verification, analysis.
And it's understood that the sarcohols were interested in doing so.
@Munstead, our current president has been elected on a case-by-case anti-sarkozysism vogue (a non-place and no conviction) that seems to have been conquered by judges (2 referred to in correctional), two Dutch journalists.
If this collusion that is revealed between justice, politics, executive and the press that is not supposed to be an organ of power is not surprising to you, it is your mind that separates you!
RV with Holland...
And of course all that is only coincidence and not teleguided!!!!
If you think only Sarkozy's support is indigested!
From the extract I could read, the VA article makes it just to drag the locker.
I've had so much to do with it.
For the rest, the world's complaint has little chance of losing because journalists are not "astrins" in the secret of sources, is it not?
There seems to be no confusion between VA and power, while there seems to be confusion between power and the world's journalists for an action against an opponent.
I must not be the only one waiting for an explanation from the world about the background and its dangerous relationships.
We are well in front of a state scandal that in any other democracy would cause the fall of the government involved.
From where this editorial to boths, which says long about the complexity with the current government.
It's not a left or right question, it's more serious.
I'd have thought the ice would be good with the smoker!
It's just for the figures and for reducing wages and creating housing problems, I'm sure that if I was a second generation immigrant whose life was pleasant because my parents had come here I would have doubts about immigration, but that's not a reason to oppose controls.
One of the most sensitive people in a BBC broadcast on immigration was a second generation Sikh who said that it was easy with the number of people who entered and the changes they made with them, she was associated with a Muslim man who was not of all co-operatives, even refusing to give soups simply because of the woman's religion, and she also refused to enter her place of worship even though she claimed that she was not obliged to pray.
** "who said it wasn't PAS in the easy way"
As we all know, if we let it go, the United Kingdom will continue to go to the right - whatever limits are imposed and it must be admired even if it's a pub director:) That's so much better for you!
More to the right?
Where do you live?
If this country were more left, it would be Communist.
According to you, what has the New Labour done, which is especially left?
The liberalization of a country, the NHS this NHS is repeated, the massive immigration of immigrants (according to their own terms for the well-being of the right-wing nose), the culture of social advantages, the age of the whole East-East, the political right-wing.
I understand that the Labour is a left-wing and non-community centre, I have said this to bludgeon, and what I mean is that they have socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them independent of the State.
It's typical of the left, if you want my opinion.
Leave your arguments ready as much as you want, but what I asked you is specific examples of left-wing policy, or a left-wing programme defended by the New Labour Government.
Can you do this?
With all my respect, that's not what you asked Daniel Johnson to do what he said was the New Labour, which is especially right.
He gave you his advice, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you requested.
Yes - it's more Tim Bell's territory.
So Martin Sorrell, the most powerful advertising director in the United Kingdom, shares the situation of his parents with those of economic migrants who are now in Britain?
What an insult to their memory!
He had every reason to do so.
France to French!
It was hit in 40 45 to fall into another dischation, that of money.
We'll make great economies by seeing these technologies...
I think we should renegotiate the treaties.
Either, renegotiations and if the word "democracy" is still meaning in Europe, should it not?
Unfortunately, the Commission does not think about the unfair tax competition between countries for the benefit of companies.
This must be disproportionate.
Europe's not the solution, it's the problem...
The EU has only one objective: to make the rail transport sector fully operational.
In the end, this means that entire breads in the French territory will no longer be served by the rail.
The departure already caused by many territories will only make it stronger.
Every sacrifice, including the advance of a country, on behalf of the liberal dox, I don't like a good idea.
The EU is a real problem that will have to be dealt with well one day.
Not at all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means to clarify the accounts of the SNCF.
The French state has been disengaged for a long time.
The regions have the impression of paying for nothing, but they do not have the means to force the sqf to comply with its commitments.
Or using public money without cash, it is essential for our days when public resources are demanding.
And the enormous needs.
I don't see very well what competition for TERs could be!
Is there another problem with alcohol?
If that's the case, shouldn't he be the chief of praise?
It seems to me that you have not really been able to distinguish the problems that existed during marriage and that you are, of course, always coming to end the pain and anger now that more than five years have passed.
Obviously, having an ex-alcoholic life so close to you and having what seems to be a daily impact on your life is exciting and very difficult.
That would seem to me to start the separation process between your life and the complications you have inherited.
It's said that's what they do, but it's hostile to me.
Since you all live as close to each other and as complications seem likely to persist while new ones become surfaces, have you thought of a “study plan” so that you can make a difference between your life and your future?
Financial problems have a bad effect, but with a compact real estate credit company, a good lawyer and a little pressure from the court, they can be resolved.

Why don't you go to a family advisory group to say things openly and to give him support to help him get back to work and pay the food pension.
I think that's the key.
Your life is done much more than the time you spent with your ex.
Very good advice.
My counsel, ask the children what they want to do, even if that means meeting the new woman.
Tell them that you will support their choice whatever.
Warn them that he will not strictly keep his promises concerning contact and ask them to reflect on how this would make them feel and how they will handle the disappointment if they do not have their duties.
Try to keep them in touch with their father.
If they see that you do this for their good, despite your own feeling because of the way he treated you, they will respect you.
They will never cease to love you, and if you do all you can to facilitate a father/child relationship, they will be grateful when they are older.
I think that children end up understanding who's wrong, if they're allowed to see things by themselves.
Go to another little effort you are close to Godwin point.
This is because, in 30-40 years, civilization will have disappeared, the short-term economic interests are too powerful, this is the power of land against the power to make.
In addition to globalization, the country that does at least say social, tax but also environmental has a competitive advantage, and others are obliged to follow.
All the politicians are looking for is growth, growth.
There would be international coordination, but from here...
These are not climates that produce C02.
It's the whole world Those who heat themselves, those who use the climate, those who take the plane or the car, those who live in dwellings that have been badly built, those who buy industrial products that they have to produce and transport.
These are not the climatesceptics that have shown against the ecotaxis, but drivers.
No policy is climate-sceptic and Arnold S consumes much more than I do.
But no one says that climates send more CO2 than others.
Environmental defenders are also moving for conferences.
It is that individual actions, even if they count, will not suffice.
There is also a need for political action (other sources of energy, reducing dependence on car, etc.).
And politicians act partly according to the sensitivity of their elections.

The United Kingdom depends on immigration to pay all our pensions, to care for our old people, to see their hygienic bases, to bury 30,000 people who die each year of hypothermia or hunger, (do not forget your wool and bunnet, which allows you to warm up, to increase your heating and to eat this sandwich at breakfast).
Don't be so mad.
Uncontrolled and untested immigration will lead Ebola to Europe and the rest of the world.

Here's how public money is spent to allow an infumous minority of individuals to spend good time in space making gypsies and round all by playing clowns in front of television cameras.
Therefore, the television has not invented anything, and the authorities certainly expect a baby to be designed up there to blow the world up and rob the media coverage of Western queens accustomed to the motherhoods of tabloids.
They may have to go back to the ground to find out we're out here!
Contrary to what you seem to think, men or women are not sent to space to make carpets or clowns, but to work.
And these works are very useful to mankind in general.
And that, in all areas.
Many things that improve our daily life are the result of space research.
So yes, it's the money that's spent on it.
You can quote only one thing that improves our daily life and is from space research.
It's just a cowardly guff.
the billing style that works the point in the air (for example to write to the ceiling)

Bref, working to work doesn't mean anything, and it's even the vacancy.

After the infection of individuals who go into space, there are several tens of thousands of others who work as hard as possible.
You know, people who smoke, including more and more private companies, especially to drive the cargo to the station.
If you want to buy a plastic gun...
But those who don't think to buy a plastic gun now but who have the potential to buy it in the future?
Maybe they're the most dangerous of all.
Not because the plastic cup was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to trick people into believing that it's a real gun used to commit a crime.
The plastic blades may be kitsch decorations, but nothing else.
A very embarrassing article, would it have hurt the author/editor rather than put a picture of the sword in question instead of the generic photos of 'plastic swords' ?
Or even being curious enough to ask what the inscription (if any) was above?
Mauvais typical report, we refer to the fact that "this is not just a plastic sword" and not the inspired Jihadi text that is written above.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the greatest symbols of Shiite Islam.
The Dirani family, on the other hand, is Shiite Muslim born in Afghanistan, the terrorist groups that seek to overthrow the governments in Syria and in Iraq are almost exclusively Sunni Muslims.
Only if people stopped restricting the fact that plastic cages were harmless.
In the hands of the skilled, they can be deadly.
Even the small envelopes we give in the fast rest can hurt the flesh.
Thank you very much for this information, so if it is a common decoration object, it justifies the smile the author gives it.
It is not wrong to try to make them a "ha, ha, a plastic knife", the facts you have stated support their argument.
On the occasion I saw these decorative objects in Muslim houses, or paints on the walls, they never had the threatening air, just another version of a "cross".
Oh, Jesus, you're right.
And it takes all her sense now...
I saw this guy who seemed to be from the Middle East in Kebab Stop and who distributed plastic bags to anyone who was all night!
I love the conclusion very much.
All the wonderful news, often technological, gives many people the impression that it is a right and a need to gain it, but they have an immediate and worse cost, a fixed cost (subscription, electricity consumption) that is left in the budgets.
And the inability to take advantage of new technologies will result from frustration.
For example, call on the Solidarity Energy Pact, which allows for the isolation of a house's cables for 1€ symbolic when it is used by a modest home (work costs are actually carried out by the energy suppliers!).
Simple but well known even if more than 3,000 houses were so isolated this year!
Interesting this PES.
But I never heard of it.
Who can call it and how does it work?
for information 60 million consumers, test water savings dolls and predict the position of water savings on robinets and WCs.
The study shows that a family of 4 people can reduce their water bill by 30% (from 150 m3/year to 100 m3) or 50 m3 of the water economy per year, while maintaining the same comfort.
This is not a demand crisis, it is a system crisis that is no longer going to produce enough surpluses (if it then redistributiond in real terms of income increase) so that these surpluses will bear the increase of the expenditure you are classified in the category "constant expenditure".
In other words, energy precarnation is “just” the reverse of the medium of the fact that the economy is no longer growing as quickly as it would like.
Note that the (neo-) classical theory of the economy is completely incapable of answering such a question, because for it, there is no internal limit to economic growth, and there is no element that is likely to make the pace of economic growth increasingly difficult after a decade.
From its very definition (in physics), energy is what enables all physical transformation to be achieved.
Because, basically, it is transforming, energy is the means to achieve the least economic production (good or service).
And the more we want to produce, the more energy we need.
This means that any pressure on energy gain (i.e., "production" of energy), even in the form of an increase in its price, is forced to increase production (except to improve energy efficiency, but to improve energy efficiency always requires heavy investments, which are not profitable if energy is not expensive).
Bref, there is a very strong link between energy precarnation and the fact that it comes, or not, to increase the "production" of energy that is not expensive.
And the data published very officially, for example by the International Energy Agency, show that the situation will only be worse in the years and decades to come (the IAEA, in these last reports, clearly indicates that in 2008 the production of conventional oil was achieved, i.e. no oil.
But oil is the most universal form of energy, because of its very strong energy density, its ease of transport and handling and storage, its variety of uses, etc.)
Three points, good job whatever performance.
It was a good performance in Germany and there was nothing left to do, so it's the same thing.
Take this to France!
Vote No. 18.
Are you a Guardian webmaster?
As noted earlier: It's good to win.
It's good to win.
In fact, the boys are working very well.
Although many English people like to move to the Ecossais when they just lose, there is no point in saying, they bring some color to the tournaments when they arrive to qualify, at least until they get rid of them in the first round.
It's even more rigid if we play against them;)
England is beginning to worry about me.
Because, now that the "bad-shige generation" is removed, they may have a decent team with all these young people.
Ferdinand, D.
Batty, Joe Cole and David Seamen back in the XIs, why change a team that gets?
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been "of international class", is David Beckham, a bit affected, maybe, but I think if he was wearing a patent like me, he would completely ruin me.
People forget about his athletic constitution, and also talk about athletic constitution in sport, Wayne Rooney...?
I've never been sick of Ecossais.
I tend to be surprised to observe their hot colors with nostalgia at the end of the evening...
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been "of international class", is David Beckham.
Yes, people often seem to forget that he was, at his best, a very good player.
It is true that Juppe would have asked for EUR 100000 for a conference in South Korea.
And it's not about what he'd get if he asked them...
You mean people come to fix a good cut?
For the rest, I would be surprised to learn that B Debre, for example, does not live only on its Members' wages...
I am particularly concerned about what he can say in his conferences.
How to reduce its deficit?
How to get back to full-time?
I would say that no serious conference of a scientific discipline, whatever its scientific level, even if it is entitled to a Nobel Prize, will not consider asking for a minimum sum.
Conferences with content are most of the free or almost time.
And I can assure you that these young people are working really and that the results presented in their free conferences are real.
At the time of constraints on the research budget, the implementation of these two figures is building.
The researchers' conferences are even paid by the lab!!!
It's to say...
It's all clear to me.
They look at the sun.
So N Sarkozy is a representative of UMP ethics
I'm like the impression we're calling him to win money?????
I'm far from being one of his fans, but we're calling him wrong (or treacherously) to manage his campaign OK.
But holding conferences seems to me to be a legitimate activity.
To add to Nina's comment, we recall that her transfers are being carried out by contributors.
Epidemiology rule n°1: isolation.
All American and British flights to or from Africa should have been suspended weeks ago.
Human lives are more important than the political right.
It is present in Spain, GB, Texas and other potential places.
To what extent does the population have an infection rate that politicians will resolve to make the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the United Kingdom, I take the plane for Spain, and then I take a plane from Spain to the United Kingdom.
If the Ebola is operating in West Africa, I see them very well prohibiting all flights and ships in the UK.
We'd always need to send out goods like that...
What harm the panic of international media on Ebola is no longer used to discuss less spectacular but more deadly health crises affecting the people of West Africa.
We're all threatened.
In every corner of the world, men and women. It's such a sad journal article, a big title so low.
I could read each paragraph and replace the word Men in other contexts (also relevant): Women are the first ones to care - read - Men travel from community to community, etc.
Such more intelligent comments could have been made on the ways, reasons and places where we can all contribute to better understanding and understanding cultural and sociological approaches, and gender differences that could help combat Ebola in West Africa.
Come on, let's think about it and write, we're not happy to make noise.
There's a moment for everything.
If you are not able to offer a good analysis and an intelligent opinion, perhaps you should just think before writing?
Although I put the female genital mutilation on the same level as the disappearance - a form of terrorism as barbaric as well, its survival rate does not only make it a different form of torture - says that its temporary suspension is a “pestilence of hope” beyond understanding.
In fact, I see that the contributor is Sierra Leone, which can give a certain degree of "validity" to his opinion, but in this case of course, it does not give a better perspective than that of a middle activist in the street.
And I believed that the Guardian was in the process of "muring" as a global resource of journalism - advancing in the 21st century, slowing down its fundamental concepts.
Who, in the editorial team, let this appear?
For a territorial election or other money doesn't matter.
I read without a doubt that the territorial public function is increasing its effectiveness, and I have never seen an article giving them the word or trying to explain why.
What would be legitimate, actually.
There will certainly be lies and truths to separate us from the good grain of the vine.
The Court of Auditors is quick to tell about so many economic disadvantages.
It's true that they've never had anything to do with the people of Cambodia Street.
CTs are not in need of funding, which can only concern investments they make.
A force to use too much concepts of the press as the World does the game of all obscenists.
Debt is beneficial as it finances investment, collective heritage
Unfortunately, the financial debt mainly of operating costs...
And as the surplus of staff (for example, to make beautiful round-points) takes on a growing and uncompressable burden (debt charge up to their deaths, because they work on life + retirement), these communities are growing in investment.
It is therefore necessary to delete the staff member's status, prior to the reduction of appropriations.
It is also responsible for financial accountability for the mayors.
It is wonderful that intercoms would have to be accompanied by a reduction in Community efficiency and that the reverse is taking place, as evidence that going on a scale is not effective without the removal of others.
How do you want to manage large territories like cacahuettes at the time of the TGV and the car?
The time of the horse in which these territories were created is a revolution, it may be time to react.
They wouldn't prefer to stay in prison, worse English, in the administrative unit, he'd be in prison!
Let's try hard, it's not too hard to explain the blockade situation in which the state of Vème has led with its prospective men.
It really started with Petain.
Then he went on to join the series "to the end of the breath" coming strong about.
Why are they not going to live in a 250 million-dollar apartment in Monaco above a movie to leave all this suffering behind?
Europe is also built on a cemetery, which will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Don't even try the answers of the kind "it's the fault of the whites".
"response" not "response"
I sincerely hope it's the sarcasm.
It was in my previous post, in case it wasn't obvious enough.
That's what happens when we go out to be the first.
Whether it's sarcism or not, there's an argument to go through.
It is now agreed that the modern-day Homo Sapiens evolved in North-East Africa some 200 thousand years ago, and during a particularly cold period about 150 thousand years ago, they managed to travel to the North to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least eight thousand years ago) became part of the history.
The current Minister of Defence had announced a few months ago that no military hospital would be closed.
So he's lying.
No doubt it was the only government that seemed to have the road.
Now, we know we can't trust him anymore.
Let go of me!

Do you know that 70% of patients are civilians, all horizons?
The London Wasps?
I loved their fans based on Wycombe/London.
How are London Irish and London Welsh?
They left London last season.
It's just the Wasps now.
A franchise of any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles, right?
This changes that a football team uses the field of a rugby club instead of the inverse.
In addition, external movements for Tigers and Saints will be much easier.
No, it doesn't change anything.
In Stockport County, we had the shame of being bought by the Sharks Sale, and we ended up celebrating our own stage with them once we found our independence.
I'd say the same thing.
The way they insisted on training in the field, although they had access to other locations, did not favour us.
I like to support Coventry City.
The good news doesn't stop.
There is always the possibility of a Conventry United now.
This must be frustrating for a team that has no bad support and that has been at the top for more than 30 years, to see its stage restored by a rugby club.
I am aware of the recent problems of the CCFC, but this must be a good idea.
For me, I'm not the club's rugby, and to be honest, I don't know anyone who doesn't make it apart from some fans of the Wasps at work.
They and a few thousands of others in the South East will probably follow them away or will they now have to support another team?
Bel article pro-domo and good vulgarization.
But who cares?
But why, then, are not all computer systems based on these concepts?????
+because there is a giant mass of programs (cobal, java), +because all systems don't need them, +because there's no magic bag. ++...
And because for most computer systems, bugs are not really important, what counts is being the first on the segment.

Real-time information has become a key sector in many areas, and few are aware of the intimate details of these processes.
15 years ago, I didn't go to an Olive Garden.
The quality report has fallen.
I'm sorry for those who're going to lose their job, but it's better to close the box.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices known to the public.
Reduce costs and prices.
There is already too much salt in our food regimens.
Don't ask Olive Garden not to be alone in the future.
It should be said that they are reasoning with Faisons more beneficial, and not fasons of healthier beaches and the best quality-price report.
They're taking us for pimps.
Oh, yeah, be careful that people didn't have too much trouble.
And then we make our soup by someone else, it's best when it's industrial.
Make sure there's plenty of salt in it, it replaces the real ingredients.
It would be good to add some sodium glutamate as well.
The amount of salt you must add to the water of pasta is negligible, but this greatly benefits the taste of the finished product.
This is not only the taste of the salt, it also affects the way the potatoes eat.
The final product is so much better.
Without it, there's no food.
Each should try alternatives to the business kitchen.
Do you have family restaurants and offer affordable dishes?
What is happening in the United States is very sad.
A balal accident at the job that was wrong.
A young promising student who learned how to fly followed his father's career in prison to kill him.
A man has been bitten and violently interrupting this birth vocation.
If he was sentenced to 10 years in prison, he seemed to be the least.
Where are we going?
All right!
That smell!
The desire to discover it is obvious and difficult to forgive and to blame at the same time...
In fact, the desire to find it is difficult to forgive.
That's what makes me feel some sympathy for a 15-year-old dog.
During the trial, the father of the gamma complained that he never saw his son again but without asking forgiveness for the kind he himself killed.
Who is really the victim in this story?
What do you want to do?!!?
The gang's father was convicted for what he did.
With regard to the Connery of Lost Balls, the accused and guilty, he knew precisely that the Balls were dangerous.
The gamma did nothing to the accused!
So let him pay for the crime he is responsible for!
10 years, it's a little bit of my opinion.
To have the intelligence to take this young man to make the noise?
Actually, it's the noise!
If the occasion is present, take vacations in the Mosule Valley and sleep in the B&B of one of the small Viticultors.
This makes me do it twice, the wine, the landscape and the food are excellent.
In addition, if you're there during one of the many wine festivals held in each community, it's even better.
Sorry, the valley of Mosesle, I fell too fast.
It's good to see that German wine is recognized.
It is important to note that German vineers traditionally use only one variety of roots, which means that they must really burn hard to preserve a certain quality.
Of course, some young generations experience different races, such as France, Italy, etc.
There is only the Moselle region that has to be recommended - France, the Rhine-Palatinate (Pfalz), Baden deserves to be visited.
A French area of interest is Alsace, which is like a blend between Germany and France.
The wines are German style (or maybe it's the reverse, short).
The Germans prefer the beer.
Traditionally, they drink the wine after meals.
Recognizing the popularity of dry whites during lunch, they now offer them a lot, and with a much higher alcohol content than their preferred 9 degrees.
But their traditional wines put in a bottle of property are so complex, the sweet is extremely balanced.
Try Schloss Vollrad space with a thermal host next time you go to the rest.
Search Hallgarten online to have a good selection.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
Hugh Johnston's World Atlas of Wine is a good guide, supremely illustrated.
I understand very well that there will be new readers of the Guardian who discover the wine, but this is a summary of each article on German wine since the night.
From time to time, there is an article on the German wines that are coming, the new seeds of Baden that are now going to accompany the dishes, the reds that are extremely powerful, but above all, it is not these Liebfraumilch who are disappointed that people were growing when they were young (you, I don't really think that this is always true or evocative, unless I address myself at more than 40 years - who, as I say, will have seen all of this).
To close the Val de Graçie would be a huge mistake and an illustration of the sad state in which the administration of France is.
A crime against Louis XIV and a spy in the foot of my grandpa and my grand uncle who studied there.
In democracy, public health management should be subject to the vote in the House of Members: these Chambers of Ministers, which are held by the Barbachet, and the decisions taken in closed doors, have become intolerable.
Sorboroin's reason.
It should be done as in the Green Sun: euthanasia at 70 years.
In addition, we could sell the meat that will feed our poor active (sic) as they can no longer go to the market.
In fact, find work at our shopkeepers, real job, and you will no longer have deficit problems!
For the elderly, it is time to pay a little more because national solidarity is no longer able to provide...
The assets, by the way of disappearance, will not be able to have this demographic transition alone...
So of the hierarchy, of course, but to think otherwise than a hospital model of 30 glorious.
Now, the maximum growth of 1.5% (which has been the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will force us to reconsider all the model defined after war!
Val de Grace is the symbol of medical excellence in France: a certain strength and discipline that was more known in the public hospital.
If this symbol falls, we're really wrong.
First of all, because the rest of the hospitals aren't high.
The scandal is that presidents and other elites are taking care of themselves at the public hospital.
The solution is more in the increase in the offer of public service in other hospitals than in keeping a medicine at two paces.
The Val is a pool of French medical excellence, and well understood a symbol.
The closure would be a mistake, a further sign of the march to the mediacracy of France.
Without mentioning the military status, which must be preserved absolutely.
"The hospital's day price", a hospital management unit, is decided by the Department with local supervision of the Regional Hospital Agencys.
The ambition of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, of course, the baby is just one of these economic refugees, who came to Australia to have a better paid job than he had.
In almost all countries of the world, a child born in this country of two non-citizen parents is almost always non-citizen.
Australia goes further than most countries with children born from Australian citizens.
But it is Australia that is criticized because it does not respond to some extremely high standards, with obvious difficult consequences.
Why??
It seems to me to weigh two measures.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka to put an end to all the persecution and ill-treatment and war that make people of their countries flee and force them to seek help in Australia.
If he does not want people to come by boat, then he has to solve the problem that generates this traffic.
I have nothing to complain about in Sri Lanka today.
The civil war lasted 26 years, and tens of thousands of people died on both sides.
That's what happens during civil wars.
However, the war ended 6 years ago and the country returned to normal.
It all makes sense now, boy!
Strangely, British Prime Minister David Cameron did not believe this little superhero when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr. Abbott...
Cameron has condemned the crimes of war and the ill-treatment that were still in place.
Several European countries have already suspended the deportations of the Tamouls with links to the LTTE, thinking that they would be at risk of torture on their way back.
UNHCR revised its asylum applications assessment guidelines in December 2012 and recommended that persons with links with LTTE be considered at risk of returning.
The year [2013] saw a number of attacks by Buddhist militant groups against Hindus and Muslims.
Elections for three provincial councils were held in September.
Take it easy, boys!
Mr. Nowak, he's gone to the kitchen with so much time.
In fact, this guy couldn't even get a chance to make it.
He didn't have the health insurance in the States?
So he wouldn't have been given any treatment.
I would like to know who is going to pay for the medical expenses during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas perhaps, unless some lab pay for the purchase of the body?
In the US, the rule is cash first, help comes later.
Especially in Texas
Ah ah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
There is still little explanation that the Ebola kills as fast as a large-scale epidemic was impossible (there is a scientific literature on the issue, with models and everything).
Then we were told that the risk of contamination of the wounded was zero.
The more we get out of here, the more I'm afraid.
You have to read newspaper roles to believe that a risk may be zero.
It's impossible to see three low but nothing.
Finally, c is a scientific reality, more a virus is fatal rapidly (in general) less likely to spread because the death of the host means its own death.
The combination of 2 (high transmission and rapid death) sometimes comes from the flu you say Spanish.
Apres c is the general quarantine to save mankind. ..
There is nothing obscenities to do before the media of certain good and virtues of the West, but to the destruction of thousands of other African diseases that we did not know about the weather, the weather, the weather, or the vertus?
This, of course, highlights the action of NGOs and encourages them to help them, but the repetition of announcements is a terrible division.
Freedom of expression, so much like conservatives.
The suspension was to keep the doctors under control.
I ask how many doctors have voted for Newman and Abbott, brothers of arms against freedom of expression and the right to the Australians' private life.
I think they never imagined that their five conservatives would have deprived them of their rights to freedom of expression.
I ask how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott,
I guess there's someone who won't do it the next time.
Yes, that is exactly what we need at the moment, less health professionals are available during a potential health crisis.
A hot storm for when the problem really becomes out of control.
There are not enough doctors already working in the regions around Australia like this.
Tony Abbott's refusal to take part in the "war" against Ebola illustrates his philosophy on medical challenges.
Joe Hockey's plan for a new Medical Research Market Fund, which should reach $20 billion by 2020, would probably be just a black emergency cash for the budget.
Using the pre-text of the noble medical research, it will collect $20 billion and, at a later date, transfer these funds as a general income.
I hope that Australian voters will come to see this excellent Russian for what it is.
Tony Abbott is much smarter than we don't want to believe.
He explained that the sale of Medibank Private is compensated by the end-market fund for medical research.
However, it is a loss for the sick, a loss for the elderly and a loss for the poor.
Maybe it's very smart, but it's not fair.
In the end, the "misleading round" and its Telstra's Markets Fund have been excellent tutors.
If this isn't fair, then we'll show Abbott who's smart.
Send him to hell next election.
The most terrible thing for Nadine is even the "old personality", happy...
I also noticed it, quite corrosive as you notice.
If only he could discourage her from keeping a buzz on her constantly..
The worst destination for a career policy is not recognized in the street.
Bonjour She has not been recognized in her city of Toul as being sufficiently high to manage it.
How good is the "provincial" sense of good!
We're living a terrible time, Mrs. Morano.
I'm sure I'm against the port of the burqa, but that's not the question.
As for this anecdot, it is sarcosis in the state: a minority of mediocres with a rank of ministers, a confusion between the government function and the execution function (if he could, Sarkozy would come with his head on each side of the road to show that he is well-guarded by the public order), the greatness and care taken to their maximum extent.
I propose that the right be granted to Morano, Sarkozy and all these "old personalities" that have been developed to carry a fire weapon and a sign, which would have made it possible to perform their self-proclaimed function as judges.
But who's Nadine Romano?
This is actually the main teaching of the matter: even the police turned the Sarkozy page, perhaps not even regretting it.
He really needs to stop before it's turning out to be for him.
I want this agent who was unaware of Nadine Morano's existence, if only I could do the same...
like bob, for the cup
I don't agree, thanks to her we're well adjusted ...!
Nadine, if she didn't exist, she'd have to invent it!
It's easy, however, and it looks like Christine Boutin with a blonde bead.
What a blow, N.
Morano evidently did in the worst of all, in the contempt of the police officer she was facing, and who would certainly have had to multiply the curves and the "Yes, ma'am, of course Madame, all of a sudden, tell me, Madame in what direction I must run to catch me without waiting for this brave woman."
"In one case, the Australian Super Hornets left an air attack on an Isis target when the risk of killing civilians became too important..."
The Americans are not bad at this, but I think even when Isis is going to pass them or have already done it, in Iraq at least one count the bodies now no one does.
As for the civilian deaths on the industrial scale, nothing matches the Western war machine.
I do not agree that the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (including non-occupational) between the two wars of Iraq would have cost the lives of millions of Iraqis, particularly children, elderly people and vulnerable adults.
Most of the anti-war protesters I knew preferred sanctions for the failure of the "war machine".
Are you also the kind of guy who prefers sanctions to order and men on the ground?
Very good note - the United Nations has been acting incredibly hard and unconsidered in recent years.
The sanctions are generally ineffective and fail to touch the elite - there is no doubt a reason why they have the occasional approval of the Security Council itself.
You may recall that in the recent war in Iraq, the insurgents have not lost their time to mark their main enemy.
This was the attack on the United Nations Mission QG that they had taken five days earlier in Baghdad in 2003.
They hit this place with strength and twice, and I imagine with satisfaction and blood-fried.
As brutal and hard as this bombing is, I was surprised by the shock of people to know that a UN mission has been targeted like this.
Well, notice, I actually forgot that.
Therefore, add half a million people to the total number of deaths of the Western nations (at least with recent difficulties in Ukraine, economic activity was directed directly to those who wanted to harm them).
This does not help your argument but to exaggerate untrustworthy statistics.
The same vaguely reliable figures on deaths related to sanctions are those of children under 5 years of age and they are even very suspicious because Saddam Hussain refused to let inspectors identify the facts.
It was obviously in his interest to express the negative effects of sanctions.
The most reliable estimate is that the number of additional deaths for this age group is between 200,000 and 400,000, but no one really knows.
With regard to additional deaths in other age groups, estimates are no better than assumptions.
Since the number of pre-sanction deaths in at least five years was about 10 times worse than in the United Kingdom, for example, it is possible that the number of post-sanction deaths is widely shared with this age group.
Of course you need to fear it, but also the gift of gammas in general.
It must be stopped to do as if people were pure souls, that love was all that children needed, and that they could be treated with strangers that neither parent nor child could ever know, without consequences for them.
One of our founding myths is Oedipe, 60% of the French are the source of genéology.
It's an essential thing and I hate to know its origins.
Instead of making it as if it were obvious and using fantastic arguments, we should explain what serious problems may arise for a adopted or designed child with a gift of gamuts.
If you learn that your parents who raised you didn't provide the gammas you left, you could give it back to me because they wouldn't have committed any crime.
The latest developments in the PMA (e.g. virus seizures) are at least as controversial as a reasonably integrated GPA.
The real question seems to me to be: the frustration of the desire for children justifys these acrobatisms and this has nothing to do with marriage for all.
Very just as a point.
Of course, the GPA needs to be feared, what is this stupid issue?
Of course, it's sad that we can't have children when we want them.
It's a problem I've met with my husband.
However, it is more serious than being born very disabled or becoming sick, contracting serious illness, losing all his children in an accident, etc.
Of all the concerns of life, this is not the most serious thing.
It's a frustration among many others.
That doesn't stop living.
And we can always take care of other children!
In a society that no longer supports any form of frustration, where the child becomes well consumer, GPA is unacceptable to me.
The desire for a child is not a caprice where the other can be used according to his good will.
Sterility calls for reflection and acceptance.
