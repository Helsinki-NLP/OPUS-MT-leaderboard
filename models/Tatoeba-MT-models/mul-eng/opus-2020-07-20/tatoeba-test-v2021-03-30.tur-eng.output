Sami was looking for Leyla again.
I'm totally in a state of shock.
How did you get my number?
What's Tom doing?
Tom wanted Mary to take him to the office.
It doesn't matter.
It's not over.
You can't treat me like that.
I'll be happy to serve you.
Tom was in a mood.
Tom didn't let me help him.
Do you know what that song says?
Make him a market.
We went dancing.
He's a member of the baseball club.
Think about your life.
This dress is too big for me.
Someone stole my shirt in the oven.
Why don't you just ask him yourself?
The room's free night is $100.
Atari 2600, he was popular at the beginning of the season.
I hope no one's playing my stuff.
Tom's not going to school today.
Sami was taking cocaine.
I need to find a way to help them.
Did you hear that?
I need to check this report for the truth.
I think you're a kilo.
The problem is everyone's afraid to talk to Tom.
We're almost home now, Tom.
Who's Tom talking about?
I'm learning Chinese.
You just did good.
He didn't care about Tom.
Who's benefiting from this?
I asked Tom he didn't know my brother's name.
He can't eat good food.
It's a straight line.
Do you know how it's made?
Tom's gone.
Gold is harder than iron.
Let me tell him.
When the party will be set up.
Absolutely!
This can be done.
The restaurant we're going to eat tonight, close to where I work.
I'm wondering who Tom's gonna take the dance.
I asked you to leave Tom alone.
How many computers did you become so big?
I miss you.
I don't think they're teachers.
She was afraid to leave me.
He's worried about the cops.
They didn't need money.
That's not just reasonable.
Please take care of him.
No one's accusing you of a crime.
I heard you wanted to see me.
Tom thought his answer very carefully.
You came right on time.
Tell me what kind of food you want to eat.
Tom left the door closed.
One just shut down the lights.
Game time.
What do you expect to buy?
Tom's lost a good one.
We have to keep going.
We'll call him.
Now we're friends.
Tom likes to speak French.
I wish you were here.
He'll run as fast as another class friend.
He's slowing down his disease.
Not all these books are usable.
Tom must've been back by now.
Why are we going to jail?
I'm pretty sure Tom can't do this.
What I'm telling you about him is due to his brother.
Don't touch the trolls.
Maybe I shouldn't sell my law.
Some think he's a bad idea.
Tom said you weren't sure you wanted to do this.
Tom's a kid myself.
This is where I forgot.
There's a crowd coming.
All the soldiers stood still.
There's a metal table.
Nobody likes Tom here.
Tom's hurt, but he'll be fine.
Tom looks great.
He was still there.
You're the first high school student in the university, right?
It's Tom who advised Mary to do this.
I brought you a little something.
His eyes were full of tears.
Do they have any idea what they're doing?
What do you suggest I do?
I've never been stolen.
We weren't supposed to be here so early.
Why do you hate your country?
I've already apologized for her.
Communism, the Soviet Socialist Union is a system.
You won't regret having hired Tom.
I slept on my face.
I missed Tom, too.
You can't get back in time.
Tom took his head off and looked away.
You want to see your room?
What they're writing about in the newspapers is a bit suspicious of what they're writing about.
He sat there holding his arms.
I was very suspicious.
Tom saved me from a great disaster.
I didn't treat you like that.
The air was cold.
His mother didn't know what to do about his son.
I'll have him by the end of the week.
Tom took the ring and put it on his ear.
Tom sat on the driver's chair.
It's a good day, isn't it?
Call me in the morning.
I came to you because I wanted to help.
That's the problem.
It's an easy book for you to read.
I'm writing English translations too.
I'm sorry, but one, can I ask you a question?
We need to get rid of him.
Because she bought some fruit and some.
I have to figure out how much I'm gonna spend next week.
How much money did you get from Tom to fix his car?
Are you having a date with Tom?
I couldn't walk any more.
What are you talking about, Tom?
I want to take you with me.
Tom must stay in the hospital for at least a week.
Tom must be shot.
She's mad at you because you weren't at the last meeting.
Tom is a salesman.
I'll see you later.
When are you worried about us?
I'm sorry it's not a "sadful" word.
Everyone calls me.
You and I are not.
I wasn't expecting to win.
Turn left and it's the last house on your right.
Tom told Mary she wouldn't live forever.
The machine's so hot that it's easy to break.
We were all alone.
I hate the outside.
It's already empty.
Okay, it doesn't matter.
You're not gonna help us.
I wish I could sing as good as Lady Gaga.
I heard Tom didn't get too often.
I understand the effort you put into this project, and I really appreciate it.
It was Tom who thought we should have a coin.
I'm gonna have to rescind the batteries.
I thought Tom and Mary were already married.
Do I have a solution?
I shot him.
It's hard to learn French.
My mother didn't cook my pasta this year.
Does Tom really play ball?
You can't continue this way.
Of course I'm gonna vote for Tom.
It's like the air's hot, isn't it?
Let me wake you up.
That wasn't a big deal.
Tom was able to park behind the hotel.
Just get out of here.
Maybe Tom said something he shouldn't say.
Tom's been doing this for a long time.
Popoo's apple.
Oh, now the conference.
I think we should wait 30 minutes.

I had trouble sleeping last night.
They're waiting for something.
I don't know who Tom's going to Boston.

We'll try to do what we can.
Tom was hiding something.
I think Tom's great.
My train's the last time we grew up.
Tom wasn't around.
We're going out for dinner, too.
Maybe Tom should do it.
I just want you to know that I'm here for you.
Let's always go to Boston together.
Why we're coming to know that name.
I took my passport photo last week.
Tom won't leave us.
Whenever we talk to a family, my husband always keeps his mother's side in my place.
Tom was laughing at Mary's letter.
Mary needs some advice.
I haven't visited Boston yet.
I believe this is a gift.
It looks nice, I think I'll try.
What would you do if the rain was raining?
We don't have to go.
We keep hoping things will get better.

Drink as much water as you can.

What are you hiding from us?
Tom was killed by wild animals.
I can't believe he's gone now.
Have you made a decision?
You made a fatal mistake.
Tom doesn't want to go to the hospital.
You made it all possible.
You're working hard.
You want me to do something about him for you?
How did you know your brother lived there?
His mind is different from mine.
Let's take a look at the matter.
I'm making my calendar.
Tom kept working.
Tom's a good patient, isn't he?
"Is he dead or alive?" "He's alive."

You're a very bad guy.
Tom's been looking for a job since he lost his job a year ago.
We've got three torsos.
I'm worried that Tom can't help us.
I don't do it as often as I can.
Can you explain this in a cleaner way?
I'm doing it as often as I can.
I can't do this alone.
Betty never said a word.
Before you forget, don't forget it.

I'm very much involved in what he says.
You're singing in Korea, aren't you?

He put a letter in his mailbox.
Where are you living in Helsinki?
I put all my personal belongings in a plastic bag.
That's a great music!
I'm in the balcony.
When do you think I can talk to Tom?
There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is a Messenger.
Tom never lied to me as much as I knew.
Tom is the only person Mary has ever spoken to.
You spent a big morning, didn't you?
Tom and Mary were both killed.
I just want to explain.
How proud are you?
We both know what's going on with Tom.
Tom didn't call me.
Show me something else.
I didn't know Tom was a hundred.
Everyone's fine.
I don't think Tom's gonna do it.
You only have to be in Tatoeba's native language.
Tom left a message for you.
The guy with the key isn't Tom.
A lot of buildings are broken.
A gentleman paid for his girlfriend's lunch.
Tom had other plans.
Man didn't expect it to be easy.
What happened at school yesterday?
I think it's dangerous for kids to do this.
It doesn't matter what they want.
I want to learn Arabic.
Shut up, Mary.
There are some performances that inspire a soul.
That's a lot of languages.
Are you planning on helping her?
Wait until you see it.
There's only one friend of the Kingdom of Israel.
Tom missed his friends.
I trust Tom.
Who wants to kill Tom?
I put three cups of tea on the table.
Police grabbed Tom's hand from behind.
He speeded up the car.
It's turning around.
I need to tell him.
He's just right.
Clara's been getting music lessons for months.
He's certainly not a trusted man.
The end of the accident was dark.
How would you change that?
I'm gonna do it all day.
Her cold friends are cold.
I'm not sure that's what I have to do.
I need you to stay with me.
You're the driver.
Where were you when I needed you?
I realized that one of the names on the list was yours.
Tom went to school for three years.
Tom and Mary both liked this.
Where did he get that crazy idea?
Tom finally told me what to do.
I'm a housewife of three children.
Mary's not playing with babies anymore.
I want you to wear this.
I don't want to look like a tourist.
Everyone rose and went.
Please don't shoot me.
Which animal do you love most?
I ran out of the house feeling it was broken.
Tom was sent to the store.
Not now, so when?
You didn't have to tell Tom something.
A silence has made our appearance easier.
Don't forget what I told you yesterday.
I've been forced to follow my orders.
He made a life-threatening walk across the water.
These are not your tents.
Tom's living alone.
Mary ordered your baby.
You really want to move back to Boston, don't you?
I was there with him.
His ex-wife issued a court order that convinced him to be more than 200 meters closer to himself.
Columbus didn't know where he was going or where he was, and he did it using the money paid by a woman.
Tom's probably the one who scares Mary.
Honestly, I can tell you he's not me.
I haven't heard from Tom in years.
Did you ever ask me a question, and I didn't answer?
First, we have to decide on the name.
If you have faith in God, you can have a long life, control over all five senses.
I did it right.
It's a ghost.
"How do you get Tom from going to the police?" "I'll offer him money."
It was three days ago.
I have to get you out of here.
It shouldn't have happened.
Even if he knew he wasn't a good idea, he convinced him to do it.
He was always different from the other kids.
I'm not trying to pressure you.
We ate cream for lunch.
It doesn't matter if you're against it.
I didn't eat the soup and I won't.
I'm a little late.
Tom went to another planet.
Atina is the president of Greece.
Make sure he doesn't do anything stupid.
This book has beautiful pictures.
"Do you know Berberica?" "Of course."
It's lunchtime today, we've had a family funeral, and our restaurant is closed.
Give it to me.
I've been so proud for the first time.
We're all going together.
I didn't.
What's Tom reading now?
You're open.
This letter is my only key.
Where did you get them to court?
Tom probably won't tell Mary you wanted to help John.
Can you answer me?
What else did Tom do?
The client's not always right.
Please come whenever you want.
It'll be a long night.
We're using a lot of tools to communicate with others.
The manager called and said he wasn't at school today.
We want you to explain your delay.
I have to control them.
We're not gonna keep this secret forever.
The people on the ship were surprised to see five people on the island.
Tom's gone to bed.
Don't Tom ever do that?
I don't believe I'm wrong.
They were kind to me.
He's gone.
I'd better do that.
He's ten percent.
Show them what you can do.
Tom is my baby.
We've been together for three years.
We're in the middle of an initial advance.
Do you know who made your pastry?
He's near the station.
I'm really ready.
I asked Tom what he was gonna do.
I've finally done it.
Mary's a fashion designer.
You should do it this way.
Is there a hotel list?
Sometimes I think it'd be fun if I had two men.
The star can be seen tonight.
Tom's good at math.
I'm so tired, probably because I ate pizza last night.
He's not actually a driver.
I'm so happy to call you.
We're not there. We're running out of water.
Tom's not watching TV anymore.
You need to pay more attention to what you say.
There will be no choice but to accept it.
Tom's still working on it.
Robert broke up in the middle of his phone call.
It's a great place for me in this old neighborhood.
He's a student I've learned English this year.
The news made him happy.
I think you'd better watch this.
He's hurt with his head.
I didn't tell anyone.
Tom's like a man, isn't he?
Xavier's selling avocado bread at the market.
You're not chlostrophobic, are you?
What do you think about this plan?
What are the sources of knowledge?
Tom killed himself.
We made a lot of mistakes.
I'll get it.
As far as I know, it's not the base.
We'll be here at the end of this month for ten years.
They fought for their tents.
He's almost always home.
Give Tom a kiss.
The baby's getting started.
I had to see you again.
That's not what it's supposed to be.
Tom's just blind eyes.
Can't you tell Tom to be reasonable?
Tom gave his father a tie on Father's Day.
Tom didn't want to take it.
Sami didn't even know who Leyla was.
I just came here.
If it's time, I'll visit you.
And he planned to build a settlement on that island.
Didn't you have to go shopping with Tom?
Come on, eat some food.
What's your balls made of?
I'll help you save Tom.
Tom left right after we got here.
I went to Tokyo yesterday.
We're finally on the right path.
I'm sorry, I'm not gonna do it without a conservative.
I didn't go anywhere yesterday.
He's not watching TV right now.
What's going to happen?
We have to work more and more now.
There's always a cup of water under your hand if you're hungry.
I think the Malbork calendar is great.
Get up a little.
I'm really happy.
I did this very carefully.
I'm fine.
Leyla, she tried to protect Sami.
The answer is definitely no.
Can you speak Latvian?
Sami was still sleeping on the couch.
How much do I need to design for the egg?
Tom went up to pick up the oil.
I have great respect for Tom.
You were perfect for this job.
I want to investigate this.
Maybe I missed something.
There were two brothers there.
That's right.
You know what's going on out there?
I'll tell you something.
I made some bad choices.
I have a nice stay.
I'll see you in a dream every night.
He's faced an unexpected angel.
You look like you're talking.
Tom asked me if he couldn't hold my hand.
They don't know about the rules.
I need to go see Tom at the shopping mall.
What are your bags?
Don't bother me.
Didn't you take the lead?
He called her from the east.
I'm proud of this reward.
Do you have to help Tom?
That's not exactly what I said.
I'm always watching my movies with the originals.
I thought everyone here would speak French.
We thought you weren't safe.
Tom became the head of the party.
Tom and Mary congratulated each other for their success.
I used one.
Indeed, it is you who are we that are human beings.
No one's stopping you.
The building started on my team.
I imagine a society that's torn apart in a fair form of service.
No one told me anything.
The bears have lived for thousands of years, and others have not survived one day.
Tom's never on the speed limit.
I can carry you in my hands.
Mr. Wang learned German because he wanted to work in Germany.
I don't think Tom's more kilograms.
I know I should be here sooner.
Were you the populace in high school?
You have to pay back in that hotel.
Is there anyone who speaks Japanese here?
I was just editing my doll.
The city was full of open soldiers.
It's time to close the door.
Can't you be there for a while?
Tom wasn't as determined as Mary seemed to be to do it.
She's a dirty girl.
Tom wrote another book.
I'll definitely miss you.
Tell him to be ready to leave him.
I want to find my own place.
That's it!
Tom had no reason not to believe in Mary.
Now I promised myself I wouldn't complain about Tom.
He said he was sick, he was a liar.
What are we going to buy for her birthday?
I lost my son about ten years ago.
When you saw her wings, she cried.
The train is ten minutes late today.
Tom took care of his eyes.
You want to say something, Tom?
I wasn't expecting Tom and Mary to be here.
Because he was sick, Tom was allowed to work yesterday.
His death is near.
Does everyone have enough to eat?
I love listening to you when you talk.
I'm making a case.
I found my reason I thought I was missing last week.
The world's paradise is where I am.
Tom's face showed his surprise.
Van Horn's office was here.
Don't worry about him.
Don't worry, we'll find Tom.
You don't have permission to do this here.
Tom can play really good baseball.
There's something I need to know.
That's because he loves me.
You remember them.
How many Japaneses do you have?
The Second World War began in 1939 and ended in 1945.
Everyone I know has one.
Tom made a few jokes.
Tom couldn't get the book he wanted.
Detective Dan Anderson, brought Linda into a routine fake test.
He's using a truck.
Every box was full.
Tom knew Mary had seen French education for three years.
Dan didn't even take a moment to do it.
He's afraid of his own fate.
I had cancer.
You don't have to scream as long as your nose gets out.
We need to stay after school and help clean up the class.
He's looking good at them.
Tom stopped smoking.
Tell Tom I understand your concern.
Tomorrow's the market.
I found it hard to tell you what I said.
Will you risk that?
I didn't say Tom was in trouble.
It's made of copper.
The job seemed nice to him from the beginning, but then he got tired.
It might be bad for you to take a drink a day.
You're too young.
Have you worked with Tom before?
You're more lucky than me.
We'll have a little more conversation during the dance.
I thought it might be cocaine, but she just stopped.
Tom found what he was looking for.
Tom's afraid people can laugh at Mary.
Can I stay with you?
I'm tired of being crazy.
He worked hard.
You can't solve anything by crying.
I did everything I could today.
When was the last time you got a motorcycle?
German, Dutch, Norwegian and English; Cermen languages.
Do you like working in Boston?
Tom and Mary don't laugh now.
Do it yourself and do it right away.
I told Tom that Mary was telling the truth.
I've already made thousands of statements.
Tom was wearing a tulip.
He wants to go out with him.
The soldiers thought they'd be home for Noel.
He's always making other people.
Do you think I'm too materialistic?
When Mary kissed him, Tom was angry.
I'd better talk to Tom.
Tom's voice was thrown into the empty room.
Get Tom a drink.
I need time to think about him.
You look like you're having a bad day.
He'll be in Paris tomorrow.
The organ was old.
I asked for my reason.
You're definitely sleeping too much.
Tom never did a camp.
Tom would never do that.
We're going to Boston in an hour.
Now call us, we're going where you go.
Have you answered Tom's question?
What do you have to do now?
The insects milk their eggs every morning.
Maybe we should ask a different question.
I'm eating lunch.
I'm interested in sports.
It's just a start.
If you want, I'll teach you French.
Tom took his baseball shoes with him as a security guard.
Don't be fooled by Tom's e-mail!
You didn't seem to want to do it.
I could be there in an hour.
Hi, my name is Maria. I'm 23 years old and I'm from Berlin.
Tom was acting like he didn't know anything about it.
I saw her face.
There's a lot of war on the bridge.
Tom didn't apologize.
All the people I know love cars!
Let me hear what you have to say.
Tom, Mary's home.
Tom and Mary are impatient.
I don't want the same thing to happen to us.
It must be treated with respect to one's teachers.
Police found Tom's fingerprints on the door.
Tom took Mary out of the grave.
I don't speak French.
Don't wait for this letter to go outside.
My parents told me that I was born when I was thirteen years old.
Tom's in charge of the money.
Tom feels unexpected.
I don't want to see him anymore.
So you don't want to be a kid, but go shopping to get a girl.
He's a big boy.
He noticed what he said.
In 1791 the group left early.
Tom was sent to college three years ago.
It's about her hand in the document.
I'm sure he'll pass the test.
I'm sorry for him.
Why is there so much violence in the world?
Tom must be here.
If Tom does it, he does it.
Maybe Tom didn't want to disturb you.
Today, March 5th.
If I were you, I'd go.
Tom's fine.
Tom showed me his room.
I'm interested in listening to music.
Tom wants to kill himself.
I'm not gonna work for you anymore.

In front of our school house.

Please don't die.
Tom's bringing Mary a Finnish tea.
Tom went out to smoke.
There's gonna be a new bridge between the two cities.

They'll be model parents who'll take the lead.
I came back to sleep.
There's a pasta in the box.
I hate people who say it.
I don't really know anything about these plans.
Thank you for having a nice meal.
Tom told Mary she should be ashamed of herself.
I can kiss Tom today.
My old boyfriend called me right away.
I want you to take these.
I'm not a knight.
He said he was against the plan.
I'll join you as soon as I can.
You're so curious.
Don't touch my bag.
Why did you want to talk to me?
He ran away from the farm.
We have to go to the shop.
Tom's making a bathroom in my kitchen.
He lives in Kobe for three years.

We should not forget to post this letter tomorrow.
Don't play.

The police are spying on him.
I'm lucky to meet Tom.
How do I feel when you're watching me like this?
I know you did it.

We're supposed to move according to the situation.
I didn't do it.
It was a bad thing to say about Tom.
Tom was crying.
I'll see your friends at the market.
I'll put my passport back in the bag.
I'm fast saved.
Tom doesn't want to be a singer.
Tom reminded Mary that he forgot to pull the symphony in the bathroom.
The ship's technology was perfect.
There's no sun for life.

Please watch it close.
I need a favor.

It'll take a while.
I'm sorry if I woke up.
Tom's car has a window opener.
Tom had a lot of money.
I don't like math.
We decided not to do it.
Tom looks like a white man.
Do you have the last version?
I'm not a glory.
Did you tell Tom?
That was unregistered.
Why is Boston such a popular place for tourists?
Tom has seen French education for the last three years.
I have a request.
One was beautiful, smart and funny, the other was ugly, stupid, and insensitive.
Aren't you a high school student?
Did they do that?

Tom agreed to come.
We can paint any color you want in your room.
I'm pretty sure it's all for you.

Did you open all the boxes?
I gave it to them yesterday.
Tom's probably gonna be jealous.
According to Dan, Linda insisted.
I met Tom after work.
She's been cold until Martha's.
Think of it as a warning, Tom.
What did you see when you were in Boston?
I didn't really love you.
How do you know that, Tom?
He waited patiently for her.
I'm tired of being sick.
Tom decided when he came here.
Tom was supposed to have a lawyer.
Get your hands out of your ass.
Everyone here calls me Tom.
Is there a threat in my bin?
She's in the bag.
How many hands do you have?
"It's gone." "The hour is gone?" "The hour is nine."
I'm so sorry you're healthy.
Tom didn't answer my question.
Tom knows them all.
It's a bad habit.

We need to show respect for the wishes of the company.
I hate losing.
