According to the British media, U.S. Navy Deputy Minister for War, William Morlan, would say that even if the United States Navy is exerting its force to respond to increasing anxiety in Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the United States will continue to expand the Asia-Pacific region — the five-point area, including the Indian-Asian- Pacific — as the focus of the Navy.
According to the British "Punishment Week" website, on 24 September, the United States launched a new strategy for defence as a strategic opponent.
After that, the United States Navy returned the second fleet to fight Russia more directly.
It was reported that these movements raised some doubts and concerns among allies and analysts, who were concerned that the U.S. Navy might be away from marking the "Asia Rebalanced" strategy of the Government of Obama.
But it will be said that the US Navy remains the focus of the West Pacific.
On 24 January 2018 at a round table hosted by the National Asian Research Agency of the United States in Washington, D.C., he said: " There has been no major change for us. "
Morlan said: "The focus is still more balanced, focused, or whatever you want to describe it."
But he admits that the United States is close to Europe.
He said: "We will continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do."
Although it stated that the general policy on Russia was within the scope of the mandate of the United States Minister of Defence, he warned: " Russians may face the challenges of population and economics, but history proves that if we face a conflict with them, they will be very strong. "
Morlan would say that as part of the United States action against Russia, China and other competitors, the United States Navy is moving towards deploying forces as a " new mode of action " , which would help to prevent the attacks from being deployed at any time and place.
He said: "Our Navy and the Navy support it -- the concept of war unpredictable, not once again being in the same place, almost as it was in the first place -- this is our practice. "
It is reported that this new practice was first tried by the "Hari Durumen" team, which had been deployed early, including visits to the work of the port and patrols in the areas normally adopted.
Morlan said that the United States Navy is currently working to ensure that the allies know that these ships will remain in traditional regional patrols and to address logistical and family communication issues for the new deployment process.
The command of the Australian Royal Navy would also be given in Michael Nunu, a statement in the event that the Australian Army could not cooperate effectively with the United States Navy.
He said that the situation would continue as soon as the Australian Royal Navy plans to reprocurse 9 for the preparation of a defence ship for the "Cussus" war system.

Japan ' s investment in trust shares in China was recognized as a decrease of $13 billion on Friday's business week, and its largest investment transactions were reminiscent of China and the United States's trade tensions.
In May 2016, in Tokyo, a man went to the Red Cross Society headquarters.
The Red Cross points out that the U.S. coal sector is under the grip of a trade conflict, which has suspended its financial transactions in agriculture.
A number of heavy equipment manufacturers in Japan, such as telecommunications companies, have warned of the effects of trade fraud in Central America, and today these Japanese trade companies have joined the series.
The United States and China have imposed millions of US dollars on commodity encumbered tax, and the US President Trann is threatening, if the dispute cannot be resolved, to expand the tax scope to the total amount of $5 billion in China.
Isuyoshi Hachimura, the President of the Iyoshi Business Finance, said that trade disputes might have a greater impact on China's economy next year.
Ivorian business with the Thai Abbey group invested in the middle of 2015 in trust with US$ 100 million and received 20 per cent of its shares.
Hachimura said that Iiu ' s business losses to this component amount to approximately $143.3 billion ($13 billion) because he felt that the price of the trust unit would not rise in the near future.
Ivorian business maintains a profit forecast for the financial year 31 March 2019 at around 5 billion days.
In July China added 25 per cent import tariffs to the United States of America to counter trade fraud initiatives.
"Our coal operations have been hit by the American trade motifs, "The Ministry of the Red Cross has been delayed.
He pointed out that the financial transactions in his own account had been suspended since September.
In his statement, the High Representative, Pat Burke, stated in his statement on Friday that the company was " bound by internal policies and because of the lack of market opportunities " .
He also stated that the suspension of financial transactions would not lead to a reduction in employment.
The maintenance of raw materials for the annual benefit of around 2300 million days is not altered and is supported by paper and paper production as well as by the production of electricity.
The 4th business week, published on April to September, was 16 per cent of the benefits, stressing that " the United States and China's trade problems have led to unknown prospects " .
Three-hour business weeks will be expected to benefit from the annual adjustment to record standards, resulting in an increase in coal production and high commodity prices, such as oil and coal.
The three traders also announced a new business plan to work to achieve a total of 640 million days of the financial year estimated by 31 March 2022 to around 9 billion days (79.8 billion dollars).
On 5 November, the Central American Central Bank reported that the vote in the Central American election was due to fall.
On 4 November, President Tranmp and the Democratic Party were actively " voting against their core voters " .
Both parties indicated that the electoral vote rate would be the key to the left-hand choice.
It was reported that at 48 hours before the American referendum, Tranun was active in meeting the situation of the candidates for the joint party and that former President Obama went to Indiana, where the president of the Federal Council of Democratic Party candidates for the election had been called up to Joe Donnelly, and the final appeal had been filed before the election.
On 4 November, Tranmp arrived in Mei, Georgia, at Brian Kemp, a high-ranking candidate station in the Republic of Georgia. He said: " On Tuesday you have to go to the polling station, you have to vote. "
"It's impossible for this election to be clearer."
The political enthusiasm of the voters has increased to the height of the summit, and in some countries, the vote has been far too frequent.
During the first election of the President of the United States, members of the national council of his political party were often reduced.
According to the Washington Post and the United States Broadcasting Network (ABC News) 4, while the elections of the Democratic Party's federal parliament remain a priority, the participants can benefit from serious concern about the economic assessment and the security of the Trenopu border.
The census showed that voters liked candidates in the Democratic People's House more than the common party, 50 per cent compared to 43 per cent, but 14 per cent remained below the threshold before August.
Another census carried out by the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and the Wall Street Journal also showed that 7 per cent of the Democratic Party's leading party remained.
It was reported that Obama, in the construction site of Senator Donnelly, said to the crowd: " If people don't speak the truth, the words will no longer represent anything, and that will certainly have a bad effect.
When people lie only to themselves and themselves, democracy can't work."
"Now the only way to stop the actions of these parties is by you and your vote."
The most difficult elections of the Democratic Party in the Senate have been held for decades and are currently holding over 51 seats.
The House of Commons, however, was more favourable, and the Democratic Party needed to gain 23 seats in order to control 435 seats.
According to an analyst on the FuveThirtyEight.com website, the number of democracies is estimated to be 85 per cent.

On 5 November, the People ' s Web (the King's Day) began to focus on the development of patents and related protections, deepening the potential value of patents, under the leadership of the market, under the current " popular business and international innovation".
Similarly, a number of technological enterprises have experienced minor abuses in terms of patent technology mandates, such as patent technology use.
By the end of 2017, three of them had been subjected to patent infringements by the sale of "Benkyingen Science Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Technical Technology"), "Scientific Technology Company" (hereinafter referred to as "Technical Technology"), "Scientific Technical Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Technology"), and the Sales Internet Information Services Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Special Pacific") against the Galway Intellectual Property Court.
Three prosecutors sought court order, and three accused were immediately stopped manufacturing, selling, selling, using the appellant's patent.
On 30 October 2018, the Chinese judicial instrument was published in the web of China ' s case-by-case, which revealed some of the cases in which an APP was accused of a patent violation of the rights of patents, including the Beijing Technical Limited.
The three accused considered that the entire operation process of "complicit rights and detection" based on a terminal-based railway service system and method "experts and developers" and that the "circuit" operation in the "APP" vehicle" applied in response to the technical programme for the protection of patents in the case constituted a violation of the patent.
In the course of the court's decision, however, it was considered that the vast West Pacific was not suitable for the accused, which had only provided free of charge for the APP "outbreaking" case on the Internet, and had not implemented the patent method, without the existence of direct or indirect infringements, and should not be listed as the accused.
Second, this case is not in the vastst part of the violation.
In accordance with the law, violations of the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction of the court should be fully implemented in the area of the jurisdictions concerned, and the case should be referred to the local court of the accused, the Beijing Court of Intellectual Property.
The Court of the Magistrates considers that the accused of the West Pacific has provided the alleged violation of the APP product on its network platform and that the accused would not be inappropriate in the West Pacific.
It is also reported that the Pacific area is located in the city of Broadway, within the jurisdiction of the Court of Intellectual Property.
According to the failure of the Prosecutor ' s Technical Service to transfer the case to the Beijing Court of Intellectual Property, the dispute against the jurisdiction of the Prosecutor ' s Technical Limited was rejected by the Prosecutor ' s Technical Unit and was subject to the accepted costs of the jurisdictional objection.
Other proceedings in the case have not yet been made known, and the journalists will also pay close attention to the follow-up details of the case of patent violations.
Visit to the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Science and Industrial Research Organization: The results of technical cooperation in Australia are outstanding
" China ' s scientific technology has developed rapidly over the past few decades, and both countries in the field of science are involved and able to achieve successful results. "
The Australian Federation of Science and Industrial Research, the Chief Executive Officer, Larry Marshall, in Beijing, indicated that cooperation in scientific cooperation in the field of science and technology was on the rise from response to climate change to climate change.
As the largest national research institution of the Australian Federation, CSIRO has achieved many innovative research results in the areas of ocean, energy, biological, material and space, such as the world's oceans.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"This is a lasting friendship, which includes a tradition of trust and long-term cooperation with partners."
In May of this year, China's 500-millimeter-ray telescopes -- " China's Sun " installed on the international front of 19 Bong L.
It is currently the most advanced 19-bomb-source receiver on the international scene, jointly developed by Central Australian scientists.
Marshall indicated that the successful development of the reception machine was based on a multi-year technology accumulation based on CSIRO, and that the FAST speed would be 5 to 6 times higher, while further scientific observation objectives would be developed.
"This is a force that CSIRO has contributed to FAST."
In addition to the above-mentioned cooperation, CSIRO has close cooperation with China's scientific institutions in the area of the development of new types of fuel technologies and mitigation.
" Previous scientific research has often been an eye-opening issue over the past century, and more research is needed to address the issue ahead. "
Marshall believes that the two countries in Australia are complementary in the field of scientific development, while both are facing a series of challenges in development.
For example, extreme weather in global frequency has led to food shortages and droughts, and food shortages have seriously affected the development of mankind.
At the same time, population explosions, ageing and chronic diseases are also a serious challenge.
" Cooperation between the two countries in Australia has been mainly focused on solving these problems in recent years. "
The Marshall reported that CSIRO, which was built with the International Centre for South-South Seine Marine Science and Technology Laboratory, focused on observing the phenomenon of El Niño and Ranina, studying the relationship between the two and extreme weather, and establishing an early warning facility for extreme weather; and the new species of forests that CSIRO developed together with the Central Academy could also reduce food shortages caused by extreme weather.
" In the current environment, technology innovation is difficult to complete alone, needs a high cost, and too much to deal with, so cooperation is particularly important today. "
Marshall pointed out that the more closely cooperation is possible to achieve disastrous progress, which is also the meaning of strengthening cooperation between the two sides of Australia under the "one-way" framework.
" Strengthening bilateral cooperation is primarily scientific cooperation for us. "
As a case in the case of Marshall, CSIRO's latest development of a gold mining law that was not used in the use of mercury, which was very high because of traditional gold mining law, many countries hoped to find a way to clean up the environment with small amounts of gold.
"We are very willing to introduce this technology into China, which is one of the results we are participating in 'one-way cooperation' . "

The Democratic Republic of Korea has indicated to the United Nations that sanctions continue to be imposed on the United States on the United States on the basis of enhanced confidence in the United States and that it is not possible for Korea to abandon nuclear weapons unilaterally in such a situation.
At the United Nations General Assembly, he stated that Korea had adopted " very friendly practices " last year, including the cessation of missiles and nuclear tests, the elimination of nuclear testing sites, and the commitment not to disseminating nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we didn't see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
" If we don't trust the United States, our national security is not trusted, and in such a situation, we cannot give up weapons individually. "
While the courageous leader was the reply of Korea's complaints against the United States against the phase of nuclearization, his speech was significant because it was not as in the past as in Korea, completely refused to be neutralized.
He referred to the joint statement made by Kinnen and Trenmpau on 12 June, which at the time had agreed to the efforts to nuclearize the Korean peninsula, which had promised to protect the security of Korea.
Korea has been seeking a formal end to the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States has stated that it must give up nuclear weapons first.
The United States has also rejected the request for the release of international sanctions against Korea.
" The United States continues to ' move forward to nuclearization ' , and increases sanctions pressure to achieve high-pressure objectives, even refusing to say 'The end of the war ' , " .
"The idea that sanctions can make us desperate is that we don't know what our people are dreaming about.
But the problem is that this continuing sanctions deepens our mistrust."
Lilongwe did not mention the United States President's plan to the second TCK that had been mentioned earlier this week in the United Nations.
On the contrary, he emphasized the three-month meeting of President Kinuen and the Korean Presidency in the past five months, and said: " If the other party to nuclearization is Korea rather than Korea, then the Korean peninsula will not be so nuisanced. "
China declared that since 1 November 2018 it has reduced import tariffs for 1585 tax purposes.
Since this year, China has been actively involved in reducing import tariffs.
This year's comprehensive reduction in the import tariff for all common drugs, including anti-cancer drugs and anti-cancer biodegradable products, will be zero for the total of 28 import duties, including those of the anticancer drugs.
At the same time, the production of anti-cancer drugs decreased significantly, and the import chain increased tax burden.
On 1 July, vehicles and spare parts were taxed for 218 purposes.
Following the reduction, the Chinese vehicle-wide rate has been lower than the average level of developing countries, in line with China ' s car industry.
This reduction will contribute to industrial structural adjustment and resource optimization, speeding up excellence and helping to improve the quality of products and services, and is expected to promote the price adjustment of cars to a certain extent and make consumers more effective.
On 1 July, consumption tax was reduced for 1449 purposes.
Daily consumption taxes are linked to the need for rest for a good life for the people.
This is not just a large amount of tax, but an average tax rate of 56 per cent.
Daily consumption taxes are reduced, directly benefiting large consumers and promoting competitiveness in the domestic industry.
On 1 November, industrial equipment, parts and materials, such as parts and materials, will be taxed for the 1585 tax purposes.
The appropriate reduction in import tariffs for domestically needed industrial goods can attract more external funds, contribute to increased effective domestic supply, increase the capacity of the auxiliary industry, and contribute to enterprise resource allocation globally, reduce production costs, and reduce the pressures imposed on the domestic environment.
The representative of the Office of the State Service of the Tax Administration of China introduced four of its own taxes, and the third phase of the extension of the negotiating results of the ICT agreement on 1 July this year, which would reduce China ' s overall rate from 9.8 per cent of last year ' s level of tariff to 7.5 per cent.
The overall level of adjustment is slightly higher than that of the EU, less than most developing countries, at the medium-term low level, and is fundamentally aligned with the status and development phase of developing countries in China.
The Authority submits that the overall level of duty rates as an important indicator of openness in the field of trade in goods in China should be adapted to the stage of economic development in China and reflect modern characteristics.
China ' s first global trade in goods has had an additional open economic base, but there is a gap between the quality and effectiveness of trade development and with the developed economies and should therefore be reduced accordingly.
Customs duty is a common means of protecting that the level of duty should be consistent with industrial competitiveness, encouraging good competition, protecting too much from industrial development and improving quality.
Adjustments to tariff rates are to be taken into account production needs and consumption needs.
Focusing on lowering domestic demand, contributing to improved commodity rates in the industrial transition, efforts to increase imports of high-quality products that are more concentrated on the needs of the population, to further strengthen business and public awareness and to meet the increasing needs of industrial structures and consumer structures.
Taxation needs to be combined with the capacity to take account of financial income and industrial development.
In the choice of specific reductions in tax goods and the volume of tax, it is necessary to coordinate two markets in the country that are good, which are based on two aspects: production and consumption, and the maintenance of good development trends in China ' s economic stability.
The Head stressed that this year, as the 40th anniversary of the reform, China's initiative to reduce the overall import duty level was an important initiative to achieve high-quality development in China on the basis of its own initiative, contributing to the integration of two resources outside the international country, to the promotion of domestic quality for the provision of the system and to meet the needs of the peoples for the increase in consumption.
This action and initiatives indicate that China will be firmly committed to an open strategy of mutual benefit, firmly supporting economic globalization, firmly upholding the principles of free trade and maintaining the WTO ' s core multilateral trading system, continuing to draw development strength from the openness of the world, and making China's development more beneficial to the world.
Serbia announces its entry into the highest military position, and the President of the Republic will discuss the situation in Kosovo tomorrow.
According to the information provided by the Office of the President of Serbia, in view of the occupation of the Kosovo Special Force of the pipeline of the Gaziuda Water Station Lake, which is controlled by Belgrade, the northern Kosovo area, the Russian Federation had ordered the Serbian President to enter the country ' s army into the highest military position.
On 29 September, the Minister of Defence of Serbia, William, declared that the Serbian army had entered into the full state of war.
Wallin stressed that, as soon as the orders issued by the Armed Forces remained valid, Serbia would continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo and respond to the response of all the Serbs, regardless of the way in which the situation developed.
According to the report of the Russian Federation, on 29 September, Hukcucci indicated that he had informed all parties, such as the US, of the current situation and would go to the meeting of Moscow with Russian President Putin on 2 October to seek support on the Kosovo issue.
When asked whether Serbia needed the military support of Russia, like Syria, the army replied with a negative response: " I do not wish to experience a major military conflict on our territory. "
In addition, it stated that the military entered into a full-time battle only to create a barrier to prevent conflict, but it was also a clear warning that no violence would ever be tolerated in Kosovo.
As a result of the expansion of the armed situation, the two major movements in Kosovo are linked.
In view of Serbia's comments, the Albanians have recently been severely arrested by the Serbs living in the region of northern Kosovo, and these Serbs have not violated any law.
From 26 March this year, the Kosovo Government and the Metohija Office of Chiefs, Mark Yurichi, had been attacked and arrested by Kosovo Army, the Arab situation continued to grow in the region, and the arrests and expulsions of Serbs have continued to be carried out by the Serbs.
In addition, the special forces of the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Kosovo, established earlier, occupied more than 100 armed police and shooters, occupying positions near the river Lake of Gazianda, entering the ecological and sports centres near the northern coast of Kosovo, and blocked all roads close to them, which had been controlled by Serbia.
It was noted that this military venture in Kosovo was carried out under the shadow of the Western States and that the activities of the Kosovo Army had not previously been notified to Serbia in violation of Chapter IX of the Brussels Agreement, and also to military technical agreements between the United Nations Council and Seko.
Vuchrich has already called on Secretary-General Storung Begg of NATO to criticize the false statements of Western countries on the Kosovo issue.
The root cause of this most conflict remains the history of hundreds of years between the Seba tribes of the region of Kosovo.
With regard to Kosovo ' s surrender, there are various statements made by both Serbs and Arabs.
Serbia's vision of Kosovo serves as the root and cultural hub for the people, as Serbia has established its most powerful country in the 12th century, and the Arab population has only moved a great deal after the invasion of the Ottoman Empire and the failure of the military to return to the north.
The Albanians maintain that the first-generation Ilyrians who lived in Kosovo in the 4-5 centuries B.C.E. were the ancestors of the Arab people, and thus Kosovo has been the territory of the Arab people since ancient times.
The subjective political division has created a strong conflict between different nations, between religion and culture, and has led to strong opposition by Serbs and Arabs in the Kosovo region.
In 1912, the Kosovo Albanians first declared Albania ' s independence.
After the first world war, a large number of Arab people living in the Balkans had moved to Turkey, where Serbs had a relatively high rate of growth, and the Serbs seemed to have “only returned to their own land” and had been considered by the Arab to be the deprivation of "Great Serbianism", and the two groups had been embroiled.
Kosovo became the "fire gun " in the Balkans.
In 1999, the armed conflict between the Albanian separatists of the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian Army and the police led to the bombing of the NATO Army against the South Union consisting of Serbia and Montenegro and the outbreak of the Kosovo war.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia.
While information was then communicated to Serbia to normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, it was not possible to sign a multi-party agreement in the United States of America because of the grief and political turmoil of the historic nation.
However, one month earlier, the U.S. Army had declared its claim to separate Serbs and Arabs in Kosovo and reopened the two oppositions.
The electrical communications are still shut down.
According to the figures published by UNAIDS on Friday morning 30th, a severe earthquake and tsunami in the village of Chigala, Sulawesi, in the country, resulted in 420 deaths.
William Rampanilei, head of the Indonesian disaster relief department, said that the figure was only the initial statistics of the city of Chipalu, in the mid-80s of Central Sulawesi, where many of the city's damaged hotels, shops and warehouses had not been saved.
On 29 September 2018, the local time was in the Indonesia Bar, a series of devastating earthquakes and tsunamis.
Because of severe damage to electricity and communications facilities, there is still an unconnected " island " , which is still in contact with the nearby areas of Cingala and Sigi.
In the meantime, the media reported that the Vice-President of Indonesia, Kara, called the number of people or thousands of people.
Power cut off, communications cut off, roads stopped, airport was damaged... and the rescue work behind the sea was hard.
Because of power cuts, some hospitals and relief stations in Palu needed fuel.
The road to the city, however, was blocked by mountain climbs, including large vehicles, which were unable to access and which made the supply of fuel very tense.
The Minister of Social Affairs of Indonesia indicated that, because of road damage, the Department's emergency relief funds, such as emergency relief supplies, such as beds, blankets, clothing, food and household supplies, had not yet been transported from the neighboring area of South São Paulo and Colombo.
The rescue material transported from the capital of Jakarta is moving through the air carrier to the disaster area.
In view of the damage to the Palu airport command station and its roads in the earthquake, all commercial flights have been stopped, and military aircraft for the purpose of transporting relief goods and personnel have been reduced.
In the Indonesian relief policy in the region, Vilandto, the United Minister for Legal and Security Affairs, called for the rapid recovery of power supplies and commercial aviation services in order to ensure the operation of relief agencies such as the hospital and to enable more relief personnel and volunteers to manage aid in disaster areas.
On 28 January, there was a number of violent earthquakes in the village of Zigalai, Sulawesi, Indonesia, where the 7.7 earthquake at 1702 hours of the local level caused seabeds, causing serious disasters in the city of Palu, Kigara and Sigi district.
On October 1st, the New York Times aired in the air like a shower, filled with a full moon ... ... In the near future, Beijing will continue to open the most beautiful blue model, attracting the thousands of citizens to the social platform to enjoy their happiness in the ongoing eclipse, saying " under the shadow of the blue sky, the Americas line, this is the best name in Beijing."
Since August, Beijing has come to " the blueest sky " .
In the city of Kyi, it is always possible to see the public or to use a smart phone, or to take a single photo of the anti-circuit camera.
On social platforms, such as the micro-credit circle, there is a different beauty in the eyes of our friends' heads, the gates, the birds, and the hooves... and all kinds of buildings in the blue sky.
There are netizens who say that such a "birth of wind" is the best city broadcast in Beijing; and there are netizens who say that if the blue sky lasts longer, there will be a cure for those who suffer from malaria; and there are more netizens who hope that "the blues will be as cold as winter and make the sun shine in Beijing " .
What's going on here?
Only since the past lives in this city have suffered hunger, and this has brought the blue sky to the fore, and in Beijing it has been called "the Blue Protection War " , which has continued to improve air quality, the blue sky has increased, and the people have seen joy in their eyes, and the happiness that has been acquired is also a large part of it.
It's the day of the National Festival. It's the night of Beijing.
At 8:00 a.m., the vast majority of 35 air quality monitoring stations throughout the city showed the green "level advantage".
The "Blueest Sky" film show on the social platform is still ongoing.
Why is it so blue in recent Beijing?
According to the relevant authority of the Beijing City Environmental Protection Board, this year in August, Beijing's average capacity of 35 micrometres/litres was 35 km/h and the best record of the five-year period was created.
In September, PM2.5 actually increased the current number of positions.
One of the main factors of the phenomenon of "the blueest sky" is the general advantage of the weather conditions for a recent period of time and, more importantly, the continued development of air pollution governance in Beijing, the promotion of clean air action plans for nearly five years, the continued release of environmental benefits and the reduction of total emissions of pollutants in the region, which have laid the basis for continued improvement in air quality.
Beijing officially published and implemented the " Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017 " in 2013.
According to the plan, the official continued to guide the non-primary functions of promoting energy cleanup alternatives and pollution reduction, totalling 4923 fire extinguishers.
Beijing also became the first major cities in China to achieve global naturalization.
Data show that the annual PM2.5 growth in Beijing from 2013 to 2017 has increased by 35.6 per cent; the number of air quality targets increased by 50 days; the level of excellence increased by 25 days; the total number of day-to-day pollution decreased by 35 days, and the rate of pollution decreased significantly.
While continuing to improve air quality, the Beijing official, based on a new PM2.5 source analysis, published in September this year the " Plan of Action for the Battle of the Blue Sky War in Beijing " , the current governance and pollution characteristics, the combination of fuel vehicles, fuel, operational organic governance, improvements in transport structures, industrial structures, energy and land use structures, strengthening regional Union forces, strengthening the urban sector's improved management, promoting overall green development, making it " the most permanent " city of Beijing no longer " valuable " , making it the backbone of people.
During this year's Christmas anniversary, the CTC, business, urbanization and public security will strengthen law enforcement checks on "a day of journey" markets, collect images of "six black" tourism, and verify that violators will be severely punished in accordance with the law.
Yesterday morning, the municipal government organized a series of "thematics" on a day-to-day " and deployed special actions to further the "the day-to-day" of illegal "a-day".
There will be transparency, confusion of black ballots, leadership, black business, black cars, black shops and cross-border "black" riots, which began a special campaign on a day of gross illegality on 28 July.
To date, the action has been carried out, with a total of 39 complaints for "a day of journey" and 63 per cent for "a day of journey" for the whole city, and 270 complaints for " a day of journey" for 62 per cent for the year.
In the last two months, the entire market has been searching for "Black Car" 248, for the inspection of travel operations of 158, for the closure of 29 households of purchases "black shops" and concert venues, for the search "13" by black business, for the arrest of 27 people, for illegal ads of 2.6 million, for the cancellation of a day of journey" for 31 advertising, for public holiday tickets, for various types of violations of travel, for 1789, for 181 posts, for the reimbursement of 41 million, and for the detention of persons involved in travel law 111.
Under the rule of the illegal "a day" is essentially controlled by "a day" and the "a day" market order is in a steady state.
It was suggested that in recent years the city has been increasing its full power against illegal "a day-to-day".
In 2016 and 2017, the City Tourism Commission accepted "a day of journey" complaints 1612 and 887, with a reduction of 79 per cent and 44 per cent respectively, but the illegal "one day" continues to be inextricably, and it has created a "six" conflict between the mutual interests of black, black, black, car, black and black networks.
In particular, street illegal customers such as " black ticket " , the illegal website of false travel information such as " black network " , travel companies or non-trafficking companies " on a day-to-day basis or individuals " black company " or " black company " , the " black company " and the " black company " of non-directed travel or non-traffic business travel " , the vehicle they use or the " black car" of non-traffic passenger transport services for a day " , and the " black car " .
In this specific action, the city has continued to increase its regular inspection and mobile monitoring of illegal "a day of journeys" and has been targeted by a day of illegal "a day" on high-end and impacting travel routes, and the relevant sector has sent the mission to the travel group on a daily basis to find evidence of a violation of the law from a strict inspection post.
Among them, the "black car" and "black shop" are two serious focussed on specific actions.
It was suggested that without a black car, an illegal "a day's journey" could not be carried out, that the black car was easily detected, that it was a single value of fixed assets.
The sector in question uses road traffic surveillance to increase the regulation of the " one-day " road tour bus focussed on " one-day " road transport, using techniques such as defence, technology technology, and time-based detection of " black vehicle " .
The number of travel purchases "black shop" is low, sit down and become a serious focus.
In order to strengthen the tensions and fight against illegal "a day" forces, whenever a violation of the law is examined in the targeted action, the functions are subject to severe punishment by law.
This year in August this year, the city also held a seminar on legal issues related to "a day of illegality" and on measures related to administrative punishment and criminal punishment.
The City Tourism Commission indicated that in the future it would encourage more formal travel companies to provide Beijing with "a day " and a day" more "a day" to further cover the living space of the illegal "a day" and are currently in research.
In addition, the City Tourism Commission has also improved its electronic network information system to ensure that each team is included in the single platform control of the electronic network.

The National Children's Medical Centre at the Central Sea on 30 September (Sungen Rouge) revealed 30 days of the University of Reedan's subsidiary nursery, which introduced Canada's advanced approach to the project "Probability of early births in China's NICU accommodation" in its lead.
The results of the project show that, with active treatment, China has reached 98 per cent of its infant survival rate in weeks 29 and above, but there is still a greater improvement in the survival rate of early childhood and early childhood.
For nearly 20 years, the Government of China has been concerned about the salvation of newborns.
At present, infant mortality rates in the above-sea areas are down to 3.71%, which is clearly lower than the national average, reaching the advanced level of developed countries.
"Probably improving the quality of early births in China's NICU House" has significantly increased the quality of life of early births through a four-year continuous effort.
Professor Nicu, Director-General of the New Child Rebirth Hospital (NICU) of the University of Reinsurance Hospital, pointed out to journalists that while increasing early childhood survival, attention is being paid to reducing the quality of early childhood survival, reducing the incidence of early births, improving the overall endpoint of early childhood development and improving the overall quality of life and population of early childhood, which is an important issue of concern for the domestic and new generation, as well as the key issue of this project.
"Probably improving the quality of early births in China's NICU accommodation project" through a four-year non-permanent effort to collect thousands of copies of births in the country, 33 weeks and below, resulting in a reduction of 1/3 in the mortality rate of early births and early births in the country and a significant decrease in the incidence of early births, with a significant increase in the quality of life of early births.
The project, through the establishment of a network for improving the quality of national newborns, introduces the concept of the quality of co-operation, the launch of a collaboration hospital across China, the establishment of a team of cooperative improvements in domestic conditions, and the development of a system for improving the quality of co-operation in early childhood care.
The University of Reedan's subsidiary child health clinic is the Joint National Child Science Unit, which, based on the project's accumulated experience, develops a guide for the treatment of new births and provides guidance and guidance for normal treatment of new births in China.
It was understood that in the project "Probably improved quality of early births in China", the hospital introduced EPIQ into the 19 provinces of the country by 25 major NICUs to address the problem of early childhood infection in the new nursing room in China.
As the past 10 years have improved, Canada's national early childhood survival rate has increased by approximately 1/3, and Canada has now become one of the best countries in the pre-global era.
EPIQ has now applied to all NICUs throughout Canada and has been adopted by six countries.
The results of the study revealed that after two years of intervention of EPIQ, early childhood infections decreased by 35 per cent, while reproductive use decreased by 20 per cent.
In the future, the Reedan University ' s subsidiary nursery will continue to disseminate and implement this approach to the national level, with a view to a comprehensive reduction of all early births and the incidence of diseases and improving the quality of the salvation of the new birth in the country.

It was understood that the secondary school hospital at the University of Reedan is the Joint National Institute of Child Science, which, according to the project ' s collective experience, develops guidelines for the treatment of new births and provides guidance and guidance for normal treatment for new births in China.
It was revealed that in 2019, the focal point, which was located at the Chinese Newborn Hospital at the University of Reedan, was working on the next phase of national quality improvement in the United Nations 63 hospitals with a view to promoting the balanced development of the level of childcare in China.
The Director-General for Maritime Health said that the sea could become the central city of Central Asia, not only of the current research, but also of the construction of the entire system of services, and that the quality of services and service results should be shared in Asia, thereby reflecting China's medical level.
"Hero Memorial" in the heart of Sintegil: on the fifth day of the Festival of Booths.
On 30 September, in the spring of 69 C.E., the Republic of Washington, we arrived at the fifth anniversary of the arrival of the Festival of Festivals, attended by the parties to equality and national leaders to the Day of Peace.
At this moment, wherever you are, please be very respectful.
It's a warm day, more wake up.
It's a very serious history, and every hero's name behind it is a living life.
They've got hot youth, they've got real love, they've got family.
However, because they firmly believe that " our belief is the truth of the universe " , in order to "remove the suffering of the next generation " , they are willing to sacrifice everything for themselves.
"I'll live one day and cry for China one day."
Over time, the Greeks set up a mental mark, leading to the forward direction.

The most important thing is to build a "hero memory" in the heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the period of the Revolutionary War, there have been some 2,000 million powerful peoples as independent peoples, free peoples, and a strong nation.
For the sake of variety, many of them have never even left their names.
A number of intelligent minds, using life-based beliefs, bearing in mind their geniuses, conveying their spirit is the foundation and the soul of the peoples.
This "Hero Memorial," without any damage and damage.
For a while, history has been inseparable, and it's been so exciting.
The diversity of history, prejudices to a strong practice, challenges justice, misjudges, causes public awareness and awareness of society as a whole.
The hero won't forget.
It is necessary to be courageous to protect the dignity of the rule of law in the face of the conduct of the bottom line, which cannot be heard.
On 1 May this year, the Heroes Protection Act was officially implemented.
From the practice of justice, the judgements of some cases are swift and effective in maintaining the images of the brilliant light in accordance with the law and freeing them from the worship of the hero and respecting the forces of good.
A nation that has pursued cannot have a hero, and a nation that has an ideal will not have a leader.
First of all, he's called the hero, and he's become a universal social consensus.
Currently, there are millions of places in the national memorial facilities, and more than a million people visit the Grand Shrine every year.
The heart is the strongest stone.
To be a hero, to protect a hero, to learn a hero, to love a hero, to put his mind in the blood of people, a hero's memory, and to be a person's heart in between the heavens and the earth.
On 28 September - in Italy's view of the EU's demand that the EU take a non-compliant position on Italy on Friday, following a massive budget deficit plan, but if Italy pursues a more ambitious goal, the EU might adopt a more aggressive position.
Italy suspects that the European Government's target is 2.4 per cent of the three-year deficits equivalent to GDP, which shows that there is still no debt reduction in the face of the reduction requirement.
" We are not interested in the crisis between the Commission and Italy, " because the EU's recommendations and sanctions may have little effect on Italy, he has responded cautiously.
EU officials and diplomats still wish to submit to the EU Commission in October Italy, and market forces will be able to convince Italy of its budget adjustment plan.
After the Government announced its plan, the euro dropped to a minimum level of up to two weeks, and the Italian debt rate reached a maximum of three weeks.
If the deficit targets remain unchanged before the end of October, the Commission may reject the draft budget of Italy, which is something that the Commission has never done to any State.
At a meeting of the Vice-Presidents of the EU Commission, in the capital city of Latvia, he said that Italy ' s current financial plan " seems to be incompatible with the Stability and Growth Convention " , which he referred to as the financial provisions of the EU.
But he didn't say how the EU would react.

On September 30, the Chinese women won a 30-day match with the Turkish team after World War I was won by the World Cup in 2018.
However, the Chinese women's rank is more dangerous than the Prime Minister.
In 2018, 24 female genital mutilation groups participated, with Chinese women and Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria, Canada and Cuba in Group B.
In view of the world-classification and overall strength of Group B teams, the Turkish and Italian forces are the main opponents of the Chinese forces.
Following the start of the day of the match, the Chinese forces entered the position faster, began to take the lead, maintained their advantage, and gave small pressure to the opponents on the ball and the grid, with 25:18 more successfully taken the lead.
The second-level Turkish team, which had entered the state, was very lethal and was able to achieve a six-second lead, and China's request was suspended after the suspension of the podium, which was to be slowed down more than seven steps, then split by 7.0. The final Turkish team was to be divided by 15.19; the Chinese forces were to relocate the strong Turkish forces once they got to the point at 24:20; and the Chinese forces were to relocate to the second post; and the Chinese forces were to re-appropriate the movement, after which the Chinese team had requested a suspension, to take up the lead in the race, with 25.23 below.

At a critical time, the Turkish forces had failed, and the Chinese forces had been led by 21:19 in advance, and the Chinese forces had committed a violent massacre and a 24:21 inconsistencies; then the Turkish forces would be divided into 23:24, and the Chinese forces would stop, and the Chinese forces would have a 25:23 command.
The whole game is not easy after the Chinese women's coaches' match.
"We're ready to have more than enough, better networking, more comprehensive Turkish team technology, we have to reduce mistakes and try to win victory through our own initiative."
A number of restrictions were imposed on the Turkish Wakifer Banking team in the first stage of the match, followed by her initial request for change and still had a strong attack.
"and each other very well-known, they're normal, but the Chinese team plays very hard, and it's good to have a network and an attack in the event of an accident. "

New Zealand is China's most important fertility area, according to the National Statistical Office statistics. New Zealand's growth rate is 35 million tonnes in 2017, accounting for 61 per cent of the national flowering area.
Since the introduction of landfills in China in 1982, all types of crops in the New Zealand region have collected more than 50 million seeds, and the land use of about 300,000 tons per year.
Of these, about 60 per cent of the total use of the New Zealand soil is 100 per cent of the forest cover.
With no copper, the product can reach a total of 320 kilograms to 350 kilograms.
As New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions increased, there was a low recovery rate, a gradual increase in soil density, a series of problems, such as soil structural damage, and a serious impact on sustainable agricultural development.
Depletion not only causes serious contamination of soils but also has a significant impact on the quality of the floral environment.
At present, over one third of New Zealand has achieved mechanical extraction.
In 2017, about 14 million tons of New Zealand-based mercury were collected.
A large number of soils entered during the acquisition of the machinery are broken down, and it is difficult to clear in the process of the processing of the raw materials, and cannot be completely cleaned in the process of subsequent processing and seriously affect the quality of the raw materials.

At present, Aksu, Kurler, and Aral have established a sample base with a total of 4,800 kilograms per kilogram production.
Uncooked flowering has been achieved, seedlings, environmental protection, and improved overall efficiency.
New Zealand's third agricultural expert in the Agricultural Section of the Agricultural Research and Modelling Mission said that the total amount of non-ferrous cotton production could reach 320 kilograms to 350 kilograms, even higher.
"There is a great future for the promotion of non-ferrous farming technology. "
It is believed that, at the present time, non-ferrous farming technology can address the problem of soil contamination, but there are a number of gaps in economic efficiency compared to landfills.
"The maintenance of the price of cotton will benefit from future promotions. "
He and his team will continue to undertake in-depth research and wide-ranging dissemination of applications for non-alcoholic soil and to strengthen the unsanitary industry and address the problem of soil contamination caused by soil contamination.

A Chinese journalist was taken by police during the border session.
What do you have to say?
The speaker replied that after 21 years of return to Hong Kong, the "two-State regime" practice had achieved great success, and Hong Kong's development had been confirmed.
Hong Kong is Hong Kong, China, and Hong Kong is the only domestic government in China.
The Committee on the Human Rights of the Party expressed serious concern and a strong lack of satisfaction by the Committee on Human Rights using the annual session of the Party to organize its border crossings for the purposes of combating the dispersion of the war.
We strongly oppose any organization's involvement in Hong Kong affairs in any way.
Any illusions and actions that encourage Hong Kong's independence are futile.
The speaker pointed out that British freedom of speech was always marked by freedom of speech, but that was totally unacceptable when Chinese journalists questioned the views expressed at the side of the meeting.
We call on the Human Rights Committee of the Party to stop interference with the domestic affairs of China, to halt the launch of Hong Kong affairs, and to ask the organizers of the Conference to apologize to the Chinese journalists.

Integrating the high-speed network of 2.5 million kilometres of the country, the High-Hong Kong Highway Station, which is located at 38 long stations throughout the country, is also welcomed by local passengers from different provinces in the south-west of the country.
The President of the High Commissioner of the Long Beach Port said to the journalist that the former High Commissioner could only sit in the north of the coast and travel through Hong Kong on the road to the town of Guangdong, where he would be able to eat lunch and feel very happy when he was able to travel through the city. He now sat right up to the centre of Néron, where he was able to eat lunch for the children.
He said that the ease of the "one-two" communication procedure was overemphasized, "not until 10 minutes, and both of them were over. "
The fast-tracking airport, connecting the West-West Station to air traffic, also became the preferred destination for many transit travelers.
The girl who had come from a well-founded girl and the honeybees from Hong Kong had gone to Hong Kong for a golden week, and she was wearing clothes in the Westminster Valley, and she was unbelievably told the journalist: "I was still afraid of flying so quickly, but I didn't think it would be too late!

Under the additional arrangements of the new United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement issued on a week-on-week basis, the United States Trade Agreement will retain the ability of President Trannon to implement 25 per cent of import-related taxes on vehicles, while at the same time taxing vehicles imported from Canada and Mexico, which are essentially exempt from customs duties.
If Trann is spread over the national security reasons of the so-called "232" tariff for cars, Mexico and Canada will have an annual transport quota of 2600,000 immunities to the United States.
In accordance with the subsidiary arrangements, the pika produced in both countries will be fully exempt from customs duties.
If Tranlap is charged with a car ticket, Mexico will receive an amount of $18.8 million per year, and Canada will receive $324 million.
Both quotas are far higher than the existing level of production in two countries, providing growing space for both exports.
On Friday, 28 September, Mexico stated that, after a few days of debate, the Government of President Tranop and Canada of the United States of America were working effectively to resolve trade policy differences and that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was expected to maintain the form of a triangular agreement.
Despite the lack of details, the apparent progress mentioned above was sufficient to move Mexico and the Government of the United States to immediately stop the publication of the text of the trade agreement on both sides and to extend more time to Canada to accede to the agreement.
In Mexico, Mr. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Vice-President of Mexico, indicated to the journalists that the Government of the United States had made a new counter proposal to the Government of Canada and that he would continue to encourage all three countries to participate in NAFTA.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs of Mexico (Ildefonso Guajardo) said that the time had been delayed for the submission of the text of the Trade Agreement to Mexico and the United States of America to legislation, as Canada and the Government of the United States tried to reach an agreement " very serious " .
Guahardo said, " Within 48 hours of the future, we will know that we have a third party agreement text, or must publish both parties' agreement texts. "
Guahardo said that his United States and Canadian fellow-level officials "required " to delay the publication of the text.
The speaker of the United States Trade Representative ' s Office (USTR) did not comment on the text of the Trade Agreement between the United States and Canada.
Officials of the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada and the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs have not responded to the request for an assessment of the objection.
According to external media reports, in one care center in the district of Billeria, South Africa, two small dogs are playing together, and it is difficult to see any unusual place, but they are not really alone.
The University of Belgium declared: "This is the first child born in human labor - the first of the world."
In school scientists are committed to studying the reproductive system of native Africans.
Günther, Director of the University of Bilgary Maternal Animal Studies, said that these two babies were born on 25 August and were relatively healthy and normal.
His team was finally able to do this after 18 months of intensive testing.
When Günther accepted a visit to the media, he said: "We collect sperm from a healthy hero. "
Next, when the hormone in the mother’s body, such as the researchers, reaches an appropriate level, it will be used to treat it with care.
Guantánamo said: " Luckily, the outcome is successful."
He said that the researchers " tried several times, but it was not supposed to be too much effort " .
He pointed out that the above study had been re-examined and that scientists wished to use this huge cataclysm that had been used to save lives.
The International Union for Natural Protection notes that the total number of wild animals that survived in 26 countries of Africa has been reduced by 43 per cent over the past 20 years, with only about 20,000 heads.
Africa is listed by this organization as vulnerable animals.
"If we don't do anything for this animal, they'll face disaster."
He pointed out that this new technology did not require the acceptance of breast-feeding, but only injecting the sperm into a pregnant mother's body, as did the practice of North America and Europe in respect of breeding.
Korea ' s exports fell to a maximum of two years in September, but analysts reduced the drop to a few working days, and said that, despite the rise in trade tensions in the United States, global demand for Korean goods remained strong.
Indeed, Korea's exports increased every day of the previous month.
In addition, early published initial value data show that exports in the first few weeks of September were growing.
Korea's exports in September and the largest decrease since July 2016 have decreased by 5.7 per cent compared with the estimated decrease of 11 road analysts.
The initial value of the week's publication showed that the export rate in September was $55.6 million and was below $512 million in August.

Korea's exports decreased by 11.8 per cent and sales of oil products.
Korea's memoranda and foreign sales of oil products increased by 28.3% and 13.5% respectively, despite the fact that the market is concerned with the so-called "super-current cycle" that may have been seen above.
" However, the impact of trade conflicts will be difficult to avoid, as Korea ' s exports are largely dependent on the US and China markets. "
Imports decreased from 2.1 per cent to $408 million, and growth from 3.1 per cent on the road survey.
The first value of trade surplus was $97 million in September and is higher than $69 million in August.
The Ministry of Industry said that, with the US and the EU countries, the global manufacturing industry would continue to prosper, which was a useful factor for Korea's exports.
The declaration states that " the export price of oil price increases will also benefit from exports in the second half of the year. "
" However, the continued trade conflict between the United States and China, and the increase in market fluctuations after the United States rose, were all negative export pressures. "
The average working day of September's exports increased to $26 million, an amount of $21 million in August.
This year, Korea fell in the middle of the year from 24 to 26 September, resulting in only 19.5 working days in September and less than four working days in the same year.
Korea's exports increased by 4.7 per cent last year from 1 to September.
According to the JAP/Markit procurement manager index, Korea's manufacturing activity was restored in September, but domestic payments were made because of the decline in the schedules from China and Japan, which would lead to other export prospects.
Korean media criticise the United States of America's slow-down to sanctions
The comments published by the Korean Journal of Labour on 30 September, which criticised the United States ' s lack of flexibility in its search for a dialogue with the war, are said to be a "consistencies" approach.
The article said that the United States of America " 4 days " , " in order to achieve non-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula " , was essential for the implementation of the sanctions against Korea " , stressing that the United States continued to implement the United States ' s position in the United Nations sanctions resolution.
In Singapore's joint declaration to the United States of America, the parties committed to establish a new relationship with the hope of peace for the peoples of the United States.
One of the United States's major sanctions forces, one demands dialogue, which is no doubt contradictory.
The article said that if a new U.S. relationship was to be established, the permanent consolidation of the peace system in the Korean peninsula, and the achievement of the complete decentralization of the Korean peninsula, trust in the construction should be put at the top of the building, starting from what could be done and ending at a step-by-step.
The article also said that the United States should understand that sanctions do not affect Korea.
The article says that even the North Germans, before the Khartoum, also praised the American army.
The National Interest magazine quotes the U.S. Army as saying: "We'll meet a powerful potential opponent.
The current U.S. Army Chief of the European Navy has also given the honour of the North German fleet.
He said: "This submarine is very impressive. See the development of the Russian Navy and how the use of resources will know that its main effort in research and development is to strengthen the fleet first."
But the National Interests magazine still believes that the United States remains in favour of Russia in this area.
Fogo said: " I believe that Western countries still have negative advantages. "
It was reported that the Russian army was to be equipped with the "Katang" submarine in 2019.
"Kashang", "New Siberia", "Crasnoyarsk", "Alhagengersk" and "M" multi-purpose submarines are improving the type of "white-M" and the volume of water is 13800 tons, the depth of 520 meters below, 64 personnel are prepared, 31 water runs are carried with water mines, mines and "Major" missiles.
On 29 September, the New China News (New York) General Directorate-General for Radio Admissions was issued " notice of the specialization of radio broadcasting " , from the very day of the year to the end of this year.

It is requested that the various types of violations found in the monitoring inspection at all levels should be dealt with strictly on the basis of the General Assembly ' s " anti-terrorist approach to radio broadcasting " .
There is a need to give oral talks on the serious nature of the violations, to inform the public of the criticisms, to suspend advertising until the frequency channels are released, and to give public attention to the situation.
In recent years, the General Council has repeatedly called for the cessation of the anti-fraud advertising.
This year, the National Television General announced that there was a public call for a "0-bomb " " Saoba " " " Bangui " " " Banguit for the prevention of outbreaks of pesticides" and a massive campaign to mislead the public against such serious violations.
A number of regulations and notifications have been developed by the Directorate-General for Radio Television.
"Notification of further strengthening the management of the radio channels for the distribution of short advertising on television purchases" provides that the video channels do not have to be broadcast on television shorts every 18 to 24 hours a day.
In other times when television purchases are broadcast, they must not be used by the owners for advertising, they must use the "sale" sound, speech, action, not using "figures " , "bets " , "bets " , "bets" or "bets", they must not be broadcast more than 1 article (times ) per hour or more than 3 minutes.

The notification also provides that broadcasting television broadcasting agencies are required to have a thorough examination of medical, medical, medical equipment, health care, health information, evidence of legal material, and strictly prohibiting the dissemination of relevant advertising.
In order to standardize the form of health information advertising, it is not possible to publish advertising in the form of health information series.
The series on health information should focus on scientific knowledge, such as disease prevention, control and treatment, which does not contain advertising, such as advertising, medicines, medical equipment, health care, and medical, medical, medical, and expert names.
Mantulov said: "We have made adjustments to the form of the MAKS International Aviation Satellite. We recommend China to serve as a host country. China agrees with its co-operation and accepts our invitation. "
The President of China recently attended the invitation of President Putin of Russia to attend the Fourth Eastern Economic Forum.
This is the first time he attended the Forum.
Don't take the United States as a threat!
EU or will reach agreement with Iran on oil procurement
The United States Government stated early in November that it would reintroduce a new regime against Iran and even urge other countries to reduce imports of oil into Iran.
But it seems the American allies didn't listen.
According to the United States "New York Time" report, on 29 days, Iran's Minister for Foreign Affairs Zareif was disclosed when he was visited, despite the threat of the United States of imposing sanctions on any State that had business with Iran, Tehran was approaching an agreement with the EU on the sale of oil.
The core purpose of this agreement is to try to create a new payment mechanism, i.e., in the form of a lease or currency valuation, to replace United States dollars transactions.
The purpose of this approach is to move across the United States and prevent the United States from preventing financial transfer.
At the same time, while the EU is committed to the promotion of the agreement, some French and British officials are also concerned that if the agreement can be reached, this would be the most open confrontation between the EU and the United States against the withdrawal of the I nuclear agreement.
The U.S. media say that during an hour of a visit, Zaraf’s speech will be more enjoyable than it has been in recent months.
As the agreement has the ability to "disappear" American traditional allies, the US has effectively broken down its attempts to reduce Iran's income.
" This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit " , Zairef believes that States have the legitimate right to trade with Iran in accordance with the agreement reached in 2015.
The EU Foreign Policy Officer, Dérica Moguerini, also stated earlier, that " no sovereign State or organization can make decisions for other people, and that it can deal with who it is. "
However, she also predicted that before the United States Government imposed the following sanctions in November, the United States leaders had the possibility of adopting a number of financial instruments aimed at banks, businesses and States that were engaged in business with Tehran.
This year, in May, the United States Government had failed to reach agreement by unilaterally declaring the withdrawal of the INU Agreement, and stated that the agreement could not permanently prohibit the production of nuclear fuel in Iran.
The United States subsequently threatened to prohibit companies that purchased oil and other goods from operating in the United States.
This threat has led some companies to withdraw from Tehran, Iran's currency crisis.
The air carriers and the French oil pipeline companies have already canceled millions of dollars for investment in I.
British and French officials have stated that the United States Government may " take over " .
Otherwise, according to a recent report from the Turkish media, US sanctions do not seem to have a significant impact on Iran's oil exports.
The Iranian Minister for Oil praised the opening of the day before, and there was no other State except Korea to stop buying Iranian oil.
Zairef and Iranian President Ruhani believe that a series of actions by the United States are intended to "infringe" Iran in violation of the agreement.
Zairef also felt alarmed at a series of attacks by the United States, when asked if the United States would push the current Iranian government against increasing financial pressure, even laughed, "It is a more effective strategy for the US, and that is the real purpose of the United States. "

"Hearing the voice of the Great Sea" music has become a big sight in the city of culture.
The President of the Hungry Mountain Management Board, who introduced courage to the activities of the Hungry Mountain Management Board to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the launch of the front-line radio station of the Hungry Mountain Corps, invited several of them to tell about the history of that Year's Roaming Station and to bring them together to the moon of the Year.
In addition, the series of events in this tourist city includes the reform of the 40th anniversary of the opening of the joint music event, the old photo rating activities, and the 2018 seasides of the "Little-Bow-Bow" great-scale art facility for the public benefit of the 40th anniversary.
Among them, the "Hearing of the Great Sea" music, as a large view of the cultural city of the castle, was a special cultural feature of the region's adventures, which invited a group of teenage girls to join the Song of Solomon to join the band, to open a 40-year-long concert of the "Old House" and "New Age" at the end of the mountain range.
The two sides of the "Snipples" are a large-scale art device for public benefit, which takes place in the area of the shooting and is capable of producing an "eye-effect" in the area of the country, attracting tourists, citizens to the site, filming, sending friends around, filming the sound, and adding another "net" factor to the city's gate.
And "I'm 40-year-old you're him" -- the old photo rating activity, and in the area, we're setting a show of award works, through a warm picture, and dig deep into those happy and exciting moments.

Journalists have learned from the National Health Commission that, compared to decades ago, the incidence of malnutrition among our children has declined, and there has been a marked increase in obesity.
In this regard, the experts noted that the most important concept of maintaining health is " disease-free " , a strong promotion of scientific health and reasonable nutrition.
The key to maintaining health weights is reasonable nutrition and science campaigns, based on the core information and interpretation of Chinese youth education for health, published by the National Health Service recently.
Overweight, the weight of fat and blindness is not good for health.
The health behind the "Little Beverage" is unbeknownst to me.
The China Center for Disease Prevention and Health, which has long been strengthened by the high levels of nutrition and health control, has shown that older adolescents are generally born with an increased risk of obesity, having a negative impact on their mental, behaviour, awareness and intelligence, even leading to high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high blood pressure.
At the same time, adolescents will be more prone to chronic diseases such as diabetes, which will increase their risk of post-age high blood pressure.
Tingong stressed that the food and health situation survey in China, 2010-2012, showed that my country's 6-17-year-olds were 9.6 per cent, the pregnancy was 6.4 per cent, and the second was 16 per cent.
At the same time, young children are overweight and men are older than girls, and cities are higher in rural areas, and the rates of obesity are significantly higher in recent decades.
How does youth react to extreme poverty?
The Deputy Director-General of the Research Centre for Science and Health Promotion of the National Sports Directorate-General noted that the main cause of youth obesity is overexhaustible and insufficient physical activity.
In the case of such simple poverty, the scientific movement should be focused on a reasonable diet control.
It is noted that maintaining health is the most important concept of " non-smokering " , one of the most important areas of education for schools, parents and students across the globe, and the overall risk of poverty and increased awareness of the prevention of adolescents.
Young people should be regularly monitored, monitored high levels of growth indicators, and found early in the scientific judgement on the occurrence of overweight and obesity in order to take timely interventions.
In the case of adolescents who have been overnourished, it is strongly recommended that, in addition to active scientific planning for feeding and movement, young people at a special stage of physical activity, avoid the use of hunger or half-fat treatment to control and reduce the weight of the body, and that it be not blind to the use of pesticides.

The "modification procedure" has increased the principle of the "classification control" of the ship's passageway, which, in accordance with the specific priority of the ship and the lifting aircraft function, has been adjusted to a priority level similar to that of the model ship and the faithful ship.
It's also a two-week upgrade test, officially combined with the ship's crew.
In addition to the great demonstration ships in the river basins and in the three coastal areas, the new energy-intensive ships are also at the top of the priority level.

This creates an opportunity for the ship to choose suitable water-based accommodation and reduce the pressure of the ship-to-ships.
The "modification procedure" has also been carried out in accordance with the characteristics of the present vessel, and has provided a declaration of cancellation of the ship's violations and a delay of a firm-in-trust measure of 24 hours, such as the delay of the expiry of the 24-hour period.
After a flood of water, the condition of the storage area has improved and contributed to the rapid development of long-term navigation.

On Monday, 5 November, the President of the Central Bank of Japan indicated that it was aware that the long-term implementation of the anti-fraud monetary policy could undermine the interest rate of financial institutions and could undermine the stability of the bank system in the country.
However, he pointed out that, given the uncertainty of low inflation among the overseas economies, Japan needed to maintain its large-scale incentives plan and to pay close attention to the benefits of its policies.
" The Japanese leadership fully recognizes that under the constant slowdown of money, financial institutions will be affected by increasing impact, " in the name of the leader of the company, the Black Sea has been expressed in a statement by the House of Commons.
He said that if the financial institutions were to respond more positively to the risk of a loss of interest rate for many years, the banking system could be affected by a serious negative shock.
" Although these risks are not large at the moment, the central line will pay close attention to developments and encourage the financial institutions to take the necessary measures, he said.
The report of the Japan Central Conference, which was published earlier one week, indicated that the Japanese Central Policy Commission had discussed the continued rise in the costs of long-term relaxation policies at the conference in September.
The record of the meeting shows that one member said that if the economy continued to expand, " the future of the Japanese leadership had more plurality in policy matters " .
The record of the meeting shows that another member stated that, given its limitations for policy-keeping periods, the Committee should discuss how long the Japanese line could maintain incentives.
It was said that the Japanese headquarters would assess the financial risks posed by the slowing policy, while considering the uncertainty of Japan's economic outlook, which could affect global needs due to the slowdown in trade and rising protectionism in the United States.
" The impact of such a problem on the economy in Japan is temporary, " .
" But how the issue continues, the impact on Japan ' s economy may have increased, he added.
" There is a need to maintain a strong monetary tolerance policy and to consider positive and negative effects in a balanced manner, " the Black Sea said.
Despite increasing delays in stimulating plans, if the long-term low interest rate violates the profits of financial institutions, the slowdown has forced Japan to maintain the plan.
Japan's monthly monetary policy is maintained; the risks posed by the global trade war have been eliminated by the recent rise in the Black Sea.
On 1 June 2018, Cardiff, U.S.A., was identified as a company on the TESRA motor vehicle.
In accordance with a reconciliation agreement, the United States of America's TESRA car and its Executive Director, Moscow, have agreed to pay $2 million to the financial regulation bodies and will also resign from the company's management position, but remain CEO.
The reconciliation agreement will be drawn up for the continued two-month motion for TESRA.
This counterfeit settlement agreement, revealed by the US Chamber of Commerce on Saturday, would give investors a sense of satisfaction.

On Thursday, SEC accused Moscow of fraud, stating that it had misled investors on 7 August.
He was suggesting that he was considering privatization and financing of TSlava with $420 per unit.
SEC claims that these assumptions are not really based on the fact that their market movements have damaged investors.
The investor and corporate governance expert said that the agreement might enhance the re-establishment of Tesra due to recent actions in Moscow.
The head of Boston Common asset management, Steven Heim, said that the reconciliation agreement should be further monitored by Moscow and did not take measures to remove him "destructive" from Testria.
The asset management company holds the Panasonic shares of the electrical manufacturer of Tesra.
In accordance with the proposed agreement, Thessra must appoint an independent director, two independent directors and a Board of Directors to develop control over external communications to Moscow.
" This matter was quickly resolved in accordance with the agreed conditions, in line with our markets and our investors, including the most important interests of the Tesra shareholders, " said President Cleton in a statement.
The charges of a quarter of a week led to a drop in the value of about $70 million in the city of Thessrament, which was worth $445.2 million in the amount of less than $475 million in the ordinary car.
In the reconciliation agreement, SEC reiterated its request to remove Moscow from the company's capital.
Many investors claim that this punishment will be disastrous.
"I think this is the best possible result for all relevant individuals, Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners says that Feinseth gives Tesla the central rating " and that the punishment of the SEC for Moscow is " from a light penalty " .
"He's still a CEO of Tesla. "
In the reconciliation agreement, both Moscow and Testrah did not recognize or deny the claims made by the SEC and did not immediately respond to the reassessment request.
The reconciliation agreement remains to be ratified by the Court.

The Deputy Director-General of Peace recalls the emphasis "to keep businessmen out of their minds and to put them in a light state" in large businesses and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market forces come from people, especially from business people, from business people's spirit.
In the process of reforming the 40-year opening of the pipeline, millions of entrepreneurial business innovation stories have increased, and the growth of business groups has continued to slow down in China's economy.
For a period of time, people in society have voiced a number of negative comments that are suspicious of the economy of the population.
Mistakes such as the so-called "New Public Camp" have raised doubts and concerns among some entrepreneurs.
In recent times, some civil firms have faced a number of difficulties and problems in their business development.
For example, international economic environment changes have affected some export companies; rapid demand structural adjustment has resulted in a transition of pressure; some policies have not been coordinated, policies have been more flexible, or are simply working ways, leading to a number of good initial policies, etc.
Various factors have been exchanged, the civil economy has been difficult, some civil enterprises have been in difficulty, and the business has been very anxious.
In this context, corrections to the areas of awareness, embodying the thinking of entrepreneurs, and encouraging the Government to develop, trust in the market and hope for development have a particularly profound reality.
The conference once again emphasized the important conclusion of the three "No Change": "No change in the status and role of the non-public economy in the economic development of our country!"

The Conference has made it more clear that it is a policy initiative to support the development of civil enterprises in six areas and to launch a set of practical actions that are committed to civil enterprises "lighted progress".
All of this is very encouraging to business family groups and more to society.
Determining, the approach is defined, and the key is to implement.
In order to continue to develop a better environment for the civil economy, to help civil enterprises solve their problems in development, to help achieve China's economic transition growth; to ensure that entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel secure in legitimate operations, respect for and encourage innovation and capacity-building in social life.
China's economic access to high-quality development calls for more entrepreneurial engagements, as well as greater space and dancing for entrepreneurs.
We have reason to believe that as further deepening reform, the elimination of barriers will lead to better development prospects and development opportunities, leading to a broader stage.

The U.S. Department of State further stated that it would visit Korea in October to promote the implementation of the Singapore Declaration of American Leaders.
From the beginning of this year to the present year, Korea broke the ice open dialogue, met with the leaders of the United States, continued to continue the major trends in the situation on the island, and the principle of the dialogue to address the question of the peninsula could also be maintained.
First of all, the fact that "the nature of the island problem is a matter of security" has not changed, and that the achievement of peace on the island is good, balanced, and balanced with the legitimate security concerns of the parties rather than a matter of pressure on the side, emphasizes their appeal.
Secondly, in a dialogue to achieve the non-nuclearization of the island, the parties were divided into the steps and ways of achieving the non-nuclearization of the semi-animal island, and due to a long lack of political confidence between the United States of America, the "who was the first to come" of Bozwi was long-lived.

And Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov stressed the principle of " action to respond to the action " , which he noted: " The decline in sanctions should be the same as the step taken by Korea on a slowdown in its nuclear path " .
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to implement the Council's resolutions in full, complete and accurate manner, but not with the aim of imposing sanctions and promoting political solutions are the requirements of the Council's resolution and that they cannot be abolished and not only select one.
In view of the positive progress made in the current relationship with the United States, as stated by China's member of State and President-in-Office of the United States, the Central Party believes that the Council needs to take greater steps towards nuclear non-nuclearization, taking into account the need to take into account the need for the introduction of counter-responsibility clauses when appropriate.
Recalling the past, every step in the process of non-nuclearization and peace on the island requires sufficient political courage for all parties.
At present, the international community is looking forward to increasing expectations for the promotion of the political settlement of the peninsula, the political strength of the parties concerned, the implementation of commitments, the resolution of the problem of the continent, the continuing step forward, and the promotion of the process of non-nuclearization and the establishment of a peace mechanism on the peninsula and the establishment of permanent peace on the island.

Every time the country returns, there is a great change in the country, and there is an increasing number of artists who spread Chinese culture, and I think that this change is very big.
Our country's reform is open. It's definitely a miracle of the world.
In comparison with the past, we in Canada now say that we are Chinese people.
We are very proud of the efforts of our ancestors in these years.
China's strength, the presence of foreign tourists, and a number of foreign friends expressed their respect.
They also sent their blessings to China and to the people of China.
I think China is one of the most fascinating cultures and civilizations in the world, and I think that it is one of the greatest blessings of the long-term prosperity of China and the United Nations.
Bless all the Chinese, because you're great.
Working in China, you helped me, hoping you'd all be good.
Make the world better, just like you're doing right now.
When I met a new Polish friend and told them that I was a Chinese student, they'd say that you're sure you're looking for a job.
In fact, that's what China has been doing in the past few years, and it makes me happy too.
Happy to celebrate China's people!

With regard to the incident "Punctions by Teachers' Body of One First Student", the official report of the New York City Council of Directors of New York City reported yesterday that the fact that students in a foreign language school in China, Ro XX, have been transferred from the teacher's position, and that the annual "primary" rating of the school has been rejected.
There were parents in the past, and a six-year-old girl at first school was deeply concerned about the failure of school math teachers.
Subsequently, the Social Affairs Agency established a group of investigations into the school of the relevant persons in the New Eastern Mining Area, and requested that the teacher be transferred from the teacher's seat at the scene.
Yesterday, the official release of the Committee on the Management of New Rivers in the city of Winnipeg reported that the fact that students were being punished by Ro XX, a teacher of foreign language, was found to be true.
According to the study, the " one vote " for the final year of the secondary school in foreign languages in Chihuahua is to cancel the " annual rating" qualification.
It was informed and said that a collective dialogue was held with the administration of the foreign language school in China, that the leadership and leadership of the department were dealt with according to the relevant provisions; that the teacher was transferred from the teacher ' s position to the teacher ' s position, and that it was the responsibility to conduct a thorough examination of the foreign language school in the province, and that effective measures were taken to end such events.

69th International Conference on Space, New Network in Germany
New York did not come to power on 1 October (the journalist ' s honour) at the 69th International Space Conference on 1 October at the Medieval Exhibition Centre in Germany, and more than 6300 astrologers from around the world, space institutions and business representatives, such as experts and young students, were present.
The President of the International Space Federation, Jean-Ef Legal, made an open statement that global space affairs are no longer limited to a few countries and institutions, and that the number of participants this year has increased significantly, indicating that the increasing number of institutions and individuals are participating in them.
He called on States to strengthen their cooperation with innovation and to promote the development of space affairs jointly.
The Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information in China, Chief of the National Space Agency, Zheung, introduced China's space plans during the course of the exchange, and indicated that China would expand international cooperation in the field of space to contribute to human space affairs.
The Chinese Space Technology Group, relevant agencies such as the Chinese Space Works Group, and some civil enterprise representatives, have demonstrated the latest achievements in the space of China, including various types of rockets, satellites and space technology applications.
The International Space Assembly has been held once a year since 1950 as the largest meeting of the world aviation community.
For five days, the General Assembly was co-organized by the International Federation of Spaces, the International Space Sciences Institute, the Mei University of Applied Sciences, the International Space Law Institute.
On 5 November, a press release issued by China on Sunday, China's Centre for Foreign Trade indicated that China's foreign trade situation remains complex and 80.6 per cent of enterprises expected to export year-round in 2018 for the past year or to maintain balance.
However, taking into account domestic raw materials, the continued rising cost of integral elements such as labour force, the growing external environment of Central American trade motifs, and the view of companies that the export situation is not satisfactory next year.
At the closing press conference of the 124 press conference, the Under-Secretary-General for Public Information, the Deputy Director of the International Trade Centre for China, stated that the procurement of this broadcast was smaller than the number of participants and exports.
The current procurement reached 189,812 people, from 215 countries and regions, with a decrease of 1.11 per cent.
Exports amounted to $2,064.94 million (as a fraction of $298.6 billion) and fell by 1 per cent.
From the market, Japan, the Ten Asian States, the " Gold Coast " , Korea has increased by 74.4% , 11.4% , 7.2% , 2.5% , the traditional markets in the United States, Australia, Canada and the EU fall by 30.3% , 8.9% , 7.3% , 0.8% .
From industry, transport tools, machinery, construction and packaging materials, electronic consumer products and information products, water supplies, respectively, 24.8 per cent increase, 21.1 per cent, 20.0 per cent, 15.1 per cent, and 7.6 per cent, dry clothing and household appliances fall by 13.0 per cent, 6.7 per cent.
The military indicated that, as a rain and windmark for China's foreign trade, the situation and exports of this broadband buyers showed that there were still many uncertainties in China's foreign trade development over the next year.
However, with the in-depth progress made towards structural reforms, as well as the policy measures on "six" in recent countries and local soils, the new momentum for foreign trade in China is accelerating, and the growth of the business market is increasing, which is an important basis and strong condition for foreign trade development.
" The integrated factors that are expected to maintain a steady growth, quality and effectiveness throughout the year in Chinese exports. " The military said.
In September, the Chinese Customs General announced that the price of the United States dollars rose by 14.5 per cent compared with the growth of the US$14.3 per cent, the decrease in trade in September was $316.9 million, and the increase in exports and trade in September was the highest since February.
Despite the steady increase in trade flows in the United States, China's export performance in September is still much more than expected, and it needs to be extensive, and it is likely that China's foreign trade prices will be high before the US tax is imposed, or as a major contributory factor, to a degree of competitorism, but it is also a sign of China's foreign trade's clump, but the US trade war against confidence, which has been fought against the slowdown of the industrial chain, which analysts believe the challenge of China's foreign trade might appear in four or three years.
The Road Survey showed that the United States Fund Manager recommended that more cash be held in September and continued to be careful of the position of the United States and China on the basis of the latest round of import import tariffs and that there was no slow signs of the dispute.
However, according to the management recommendations of the 12 fund managers involved in this survey, North America's assets had increased to the highest since June 2017, while the euro area, particularly the emerging markets, had fallen.
The global share ratio is 56.6 per cent, the debt is 35.5 per cent and is basically consistent with the previous month's survey.
Its most evident change is that cash ratio rose to 5.1%, which was highest since December 2014.
A fund manager of a large fund company stated that " some economic data have led to market confidence, but trade war remains the biggest concern, so it would be best to prepare for entry when it returns to the market. "
However, in September, the Fund's manager still preferred shares, in particular United States shares, even if the United States shares were considered to be high prices.
Today, in China's open-label sea, the first major national exhibition to be introduced as the topic of global imports — China's international import exhibition, which is expected to open the screens in the world.
A show will be like a window, which will give the world a better understanding of a city and a country.
Through this "window " , people see the "opening China" at a higher level; thanks to the "opening China" window in the House, they welcome the success of China's interaction with the "opening the reform" of the world.
"In the case of a country, open as if it were a broken hole, even though it would suffer for a time, but will change into a new life. "
A key reason why China can't do this is that the Secretary-General's recent report on the conclusion of the open road.
Recalling the 40-year opening of the reform, in order to reach China, the Great Lakes of the World Market, despite the drought and wind, the open-minded approach to all risk challenges, the continued release of internal mobility and the continued increase in competitiveness.
It can be said that China has been able to explain the values and meaning of openness with its own real achievements.
At the beginning of the new history, the symposium on the subject was a major decision taken to promote a new high-level open-up in the Middle East, a major step towards the open market in China, a major initiative to support the practical actions of economic globalization and trade liberalization, which demonstrated the strong and clear will of China's "open doors will not be closed, but will only be extended" by the opening door.
And the country's showlists report that " a challenge " is the most sure and best response to the open economy in the wider, wider areas of China and deeper development of the open economy.
More importantly, the current global trade order has reached a crossing point.
The high walls of trade protectionism, the return of unilateralism, the international community's concern for the prospects of free trade have increased, and many uncertainties have been added to the emerging world economy.
In the context of such times, this summit of the Gulf of Cyprus reflected China's protection of free trade and made the world see the open market and shared the future of China itself and China.
Get out of here. Get out of here.
China's fervor and gripping the world has not only contributed to its own development but also brought to the nations of the world and to the region the " chance of China " .
In recent years, the promotion and promotion of " a single road " , the creation of Asia, the establishment of a roadmap ... China has provided a range of international public products, providing real export markets, development opportunities and jobs, enabling businesses to transport " fast-paced " cars " in China.
It is also such a public product, a global platform for trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 130 enterprises in more than 130 countries and regions have a unique high-quality product and service lighting display with a new step in the Chinese market.
In addition to national enterprises, there are domestic consumers who are truly benefiting.
Through the development of this "opportunity" platform, a multi-channel supply of quality for consumer upgrades has been provided to meet the needs of the peoples for the individualization, diversification and diversification of consumption.
As China’s open door expands and expands, it is becoming more and more solid in terms of its use.
From a more objective point of view, the importance of membership in the House has gone beyond the scope of economic and trade, but in the future, it is open, inclusive, universal, balanced and shared ideas that create a common consensus on the challenges that are facing today.
The world is good, China is good; China is good, the world is better.
We look forward to the future of the House of Lords for the world's beauty and prosperity, and we look forward to the bright future of the world's higher-level "Open China" community for human fate.
External media: The United States of America has reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[A brief] The content of the agreement includes Canada's opening up its dairy market to the United States, and the United States does not impose tariffs on Canadian cars produced temporarily.
According to external media reports, a Canadian newsman appeared on the night of 30 September, and the United States and Canada had reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The content of the agreement was disclosed to Canada to open its milk market to the United States, as well as to the United States not temporarily taxing cars produced by Canada.
On 27 October, the United States and Mexico announced an initial principle agreement on updating the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement established in the United States before 31 August to extend the negotiating period until 30 September.
Earlier, the speaker from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada, Friland, said that Canada would only sign a favourable agreement, " focusing on substantive rather than timetables. We would like to continue consultations and wish to reach an agreement that is in line with the interests of Canada ' s countries. "
More than nine Brazilian women's voters claim that the presidential candidate did not consider women's needs.
According to South American Newspapers, recent data published by the National Geographic Institute of Brazil (IBGE) indicate that more than 90 per cent of Brazilian women do not consider women ' s needs to be considered by the presidential candidates.
It is reported that the number of women in Brazil has now reached 117 million, so that if the number of women in Brazil is to be a country, the population of that country will be global 13 and more than twice the national population of Spain.
In Brazil, the number of female voters was 52 per cent of the total number of voters, and men were 48 per cent, although women were very high in the electorate, but in Brazil, only 10 per cent were women.
Of the 193 countries in the world, the participation of women in politics is only 154, higher than in the Arab countries.
Following more than 20 years of human rights struggle, women in Brazil have not been able to obtain their own rights.
Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori noted that the existence of this phenomenon was the result of the common role of ancient father society, racism and capitalism.
" Politicians should be democraticized by national civil rights, their identity, their access to public products and the same society as many social groups, but Brazil's politics belongs to one group and most people are not represented. "
A study conducted earlier by the Brazilian Institute of Motor Vehicles (Locomoviva) also indicated that 94 per cent of Brazilian women did not think that the politicians of the elections could represent their rights, 90 per cent of Brazilian women did not agree with the decisions taken by the politicians, and 93 per cent of women did not agree with the current government's governance policy.
"We need to reverse the problem of women's representation in parliament, and the political system in Brazil remains under the influence of inequality. To date, there have been serious gender, class and racial discrimination in the political sphere of Brazil. "Natalia Mori says.
Although women ' s rights are inadequate, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey showed that 76 per cent of women felt that they could be active in democratic elections and 72 per cent of women were interested in politics.
In addition, 55 per cent of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to make women less disadvantaged.
On 1 October, the new Astana web site, which was hosted by the Chinese Embassy of Kazakhstan on 1 October, hosted 69-year-old Washington, China.
The rest of the members of the House of Representatives of the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan, the Department of Public Information, the financial institutions, the medium-sized enterprises, the Wharves, the School of Curtains and the representatives of the remaining 80 students participated in the event.
On 1 October, China's Embassy in Kazakhstan held a national flagship ceremony to welcome 69-year-old Washington, New China.
After the flag salute, Ambassador of China to the Hague said that we held the flag salute in his homeland during the 69-year-old day of his birth, a deep loveist educational activity.
Although people live outside the sea for a long time, it is time to focus on a great country.
It has been said that the Chinese people are closer to the great goal of achieving national restoration than ever before and that they are closer to the center of the world stage than ever before.
"Our mission, responsibilities and work are more glorious and enormous than ever before. "
By stressing that, if you don't forget the first thing, remember your mission, to promote the construction of a road in the Middle East with a "stabilized " road, deep in the truth, to design a more beautiful common " road " with a "work painting " , and to build a country of origin, you will be able to work together with your friends in the Middle East.
The T2 Station T2 was officially opened in the two-waves of Lasseylin International Airport for 30 days.
The Central Coalition City Commission noted that the new railway station was able to meet the requirements of 12 million passengers per year after the launch of the new railway station, building a new advantage in the air transport sector, which would further improve the flow of the broadband network, the shipping of the sea, the waterway and the passage of the airport to the "four-unit" modern-state transport agency.
This year, Zhao was expected to strike 9,000,000 people.
The construction of the T2 railway station and the expansion of the facilities for the expansion of the T2 train station at the T2 International Airport is an important public benefit project for the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the Galician self-governing zone, as well as marked projects for international tourism.
The project was launched in December 2015, with a total of 100,000 square metres of construction, with a total investment of $32.58 million in people, with an additional 12 million annual passenger drop, 1012.0 drop in demand and 95 million tons of mail.
On that day, two hundred passengers arrived at T2 International Airport.
The design of the new railway station is inspired by the deep-sea skyscrapers of the Mount of Olives and by the view of a "mountain-water-square" and the nearby "Rong-Shiloh" view and the houses of the northern inhabitants of Zhao-Qaoan.
It was suggested that the new airport airport could meet the high flow rate of 4000 passengers per hour from port to port, apply smart-fashioned lighting systems, secure access to platforms, design a wide range of business areas, such as "wise airport" technology such as cooking, shopping, tax and leisure.
As the growth in Asia and the emerging markets in Europe is far from encouraging, the United States is increasingly becoming the main engine for global economic growth.
On 23 September 2018, New Jersey, U.S.A., stopped a package shipment in the port.
However, because the current growth in the United States is benefiting from the time it takes to reduce this financial incentive, the economy is also concerned with the external.
"As the United States returns to full-time employment, the economy emerges to its own disadvantage. "
He said that the only problem was when it would happen, and he seemed that he might not just move forward.
In spite of the positive attitude of the United States economic outlook before the end of this year, Barclay acknowledged that it was more difficult to predict longer periods of time.
" In the absence of more sustainable investment to boost the potential for economic growth, it will be difficult to follow up on the growth encouraged by financial policies, " says economists in a study.
" While there is no investment growth, the risk of the economy will rise in 2020, " they say.
A series of enterprise surveys will demonstrate in large measure that major economies are in the economic cycle at the end of the third quarter.
The Eurozone and the United States industry surveys to be published next week will be concerned and the third will be published.
However, the focus of the next week's data will certainly be the United States non-agricultural employment data that will be published in the following five weeks, which will provide guidance on the rapid employment market in favour of a significant increase in pay.
Its importance is important not only because of its ability to profit and consumers' purchasing power, but also because of the increase in salary or the rise in overall turnover, which may cause the officials of the United States Federal Reserve Commission (USF/FED).
" Remuneration will be of concern, as the environment may rise considerably more than the previous month.
The same rate of growth in September last year may not have fallen by 3 per cent, but we can expect it to collapse last month, "The International Group of the Netherlands (ING) economists wrote in a study.
In China and other parts of Asia, the European Police Agency may be the source of market fluctuations, while the week data under the region is clear.
The Italian Government's financial commitment to the EU before disregarding the financial commitments made by the European Union will have to determine quickly whether it is strongly opposed to the decision in Italy.
As Britain retreats into the crucial phase of the negotiations, the British Conservative Party may also fire at the annual meeting held in Birmingham.
At the same time, the concerns of the emerging markets are not likely to diminish as the next week's presidential elections are to be held.
[A summary] The ship will be delivered to China's East Sea Authority, and the Director-General of the Division for the Prevention of the Marine Warnings of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China stated that the ship's entry into use would be significant for developing China's coastal observation systems to advance global ocean observations.
On 29 September, China's capital, China's 3,000-twenty-level flagship "to the sun 22" was turned into water under the Chinese armed group.
After the ship was built, China will break down its equipment bottle in large, subtly-trailing, recycling and repair, as well as in the security work.
"To the sun 22" is mainly used for the maintenance of the surface/potential periodic monitoring, periodic release, recovery, replacement/potential emergency release, recovery, repair, while having the capacity to carry out integrated ocean surveys such as cross-border investigations.
The head of the new ship is 89 meters, 18 meters wide, 7.2 meters deep, and continued navigation is 10,000 miles in the sea.
The Vice-President-General of the Armed Forces said: " The ship to the Sun 22 is a major flagship in my country, and the only one that has a 10-mile flagship operating capacity in the country, will further enhance our flagship security capacity. "
It was understood that the ship would be delivered to China's East Coast Branch, and the Director-General of the Division for the Monitoring of the Marine Early Warnings of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China stated that it would play a significant role in the development of a coastal system for developing China to promote global ocean observations.
"This ship has a large fleet of maintenance operations, and the capacity of the marine integrated investigation, which is the first ship to be used in the Middle-Weapon and the integrated marine investigation.
There's such a floating business ship, and in the future our marine observations and marine investigations have a powerful instrument. "
On 1 October, the impact of the Tsunami, the first day of the race was delayed by the first day of the race, which was held on 30 September 2018 by the International Tsunami, which was launched on 30 September 2018. The first day of the race, the first day of the race, and before the race was held in the center of the Sunshine, was the same as the number of 12 water-wave-wave-wave shipmen from 6 countries and regions.
The impact of the "Hungary" in the port has continued, with the highest speed up to 24 degrees. The launch signal has been delayed for nearly 90 minutes from 1 p.m. and the wind has not yet been seen, and the President of the competition, Annie Mdrant, announced the end of the first day, will be delayed until 1 October afternoon.
"The strong winds that flow from the beach continue, and the sea is really too severe."
Mdeland explains: "In such a situation, no one knows how much wind is going on the boat at any time.
Close to the city's race, for the current wind, canceling the game is the wisest choice."
Everything's ready for the crew. There's still some disappointment.
"The boat is ready to stop, and we're fine."
"But I know that the turn of the game is the right choice, and I hope today's wind is small, we can show our hands."
Omika Wilkinson, who was honored by the New Zealand Star of the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, said: "The loss of a day's time to win the game has made the game more interesting.
Because today's competition is going to increase, and only two days left.
You're going to have to die special."
Despite the harshness of the sea, the French team of ABM, Pierre Ives Durand, met before the race, called for the warmness of the Sun with the competition: five years ago, the international series of super-limited ships had accidentally damaged themselves, broke their bodies, and the treatment of many local medical teams allowed them to remain in the field after five years.
It was reported that the international series of extremely restrictive ships was created in 2007 by a world-wide competition with Volvo, the U.S.
This is the day of the Sun's competition with the "FlyingPhantom" water bubble.
In 2018 it was the eighth year on the island of Zhuang, and it was also the war of the season's harvesters.
Despite the ongoing turmoil in the financial market, the Hong Kong Financial Authority stated that the foreign investment income in the third month of this year decreased by 97 per cent in the year, but was better than in the previous period, and that there was a high share of the overseas tax in the middle of the U.S. war.
According to the latest data from the Board of Governors, the foreign exchange fund was recorded in the investment income of 16 million ports from 7 September 2018, which was significantly lower than the 61.8 million ports of the same year, but was better than the 10 million ports revised in the second season of the year.
At the legislative meeting, President Chandong of the Board of Governors indicated that, at the beginning of the Central American Trade War, Hong Kong and the newly emerging market share index was in reverse with the United States unit index, until late in September, after the continued decline in market conditions in the United States of America since investors were fully aware of the fact that the trade war had been detrimental to the United States itself.
"The change in market conditions is good, and if trade war has only a unilateral effect, it will not help to solve matters. "
But at the same time, he said, "If the Central American Trade War failed to resolve, the financial market will continue to rise."
In the third month of this year, the foreign exchange fund in Hong Kong received 8 per cent to 47,000 million dollars in the previous month, and the foreign exchange rate increased by 172 per cent to 128 million in the last month; foreign exchanges by 162 million in the United States, foreign debt by 97 million in the month, with a reduction of 24 per cent and 31 per cent per month, mainly reflecting the overall increase in the United States dollar during the period and the 3 per cent increase in the United States interest rate in September.
The Foreign Exchange Fund is mainly used to support the Ports.
Since 1983 Hong Kong has implemented a system for the exchange of information connected with the United States dollar.
In terms of the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chad claims that the economic and asset markets are uncertain and risk increases below, but the Hong Kong financial system is healthy and serves as a safeguard and anti-terrorism capability.
" Hong Kong's international investment capital is full and net assets of $140 million are equivalent to 4 times GDP, more than 2.5 times Singapore and 0.6 times Japan's 0.6 times, and are to be reimbursed for an economic downturn or reverse. "
The recent decline in portfolio losses and the expansion of the United States dollar interest rate indicated that the exchange rate had increased to 400 basis points on 21 September, which the market generally considered to be mainly related to the increase in port losses, after which the rate of the dollar dropped by around 7.80-7.84, to the latest decline in the United States dollar, could have been increased to attract market interest rates, which would have increased the purchase of the United States dollar discounts, which would have led to a long-term increase in the chance to re-encourage portfolios.
However, he believed that the normalization of the port interest rate would change with the start of the Hong Kong interest cycle and that future port interest rates would be lower than the United States dollar interest rate.
" The flow of port interest rates will be more consistent with the United States dollar interest rate, and everyone needs to be more careful about managing risks, preparing and responding to market fluctuations. "
With the full funding of the port, the decrease of the port has increased, with a decrease of 0.9 per cent per month to 2.08179 per cent per week, from 46 points to 51 points per month; a decrease of five new months, from 120 points per month to 127 points per cent.
From May to September, the current cash exchange rate was approximately $7.85 per cent.
During the period, due to factors such as the cash flow from the post-retirement unit, which resulted in the exchange of assurances by the weak parties after the first contact in April, in May and August.
The Board of Governors, in accordance with the associated exchange rate system, bought into the Port at 7.85 level and issued US dollars to maintain the port exchange rate stability.
In May and August, the Board of Governors purchased some 522 million ports under the weak exchange mechanism.
Is the new tax law still favourable to foreigners?
The Ministry of Finance, at the request of the Director-General of the Tax Administration in question on 30 days, indicated that in order to maintain policy stability and the next step in the implementation of the new tax law, consideration would be given to continuing preferential arrangements for foreign nationals, including Portuguese Australians.
It was asked by the journalists that the revised individual tax law had set the standard for the taxable persons in my country to be taxed for 183 days over a year.
When implementing the Act, please ask whether there is any advantage arrangements for foreign nationals, including those from Port Australians?
The Authority replied that the regulations on the application of the existing individual tax law had special advantages on the issue of taxation for foreign nationals, which had not been resident in China for more than five years, originating in China, could only be paid to individuals who had not been resident in China for more than five years and who had been paid only part of the unit or individual in China.
The Head stated that, in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the tax law on new persons, consideration would be given to continuing preferential arrangements for foreign nationals, including port Australians.
There is still no "door" monthly centre: quality confirmation leads to improvement in quality.
With the movement of "two children's economy" and the prosperity of the mother milk market, from the north to the three-fourth cities, it was a pleasure to celebrate a series of months of archive meetings.
The month of the fire met the needs of the population and was not worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to hundreds of millions of dollars, but was also in the outlying area, which has not yet been opened, and the regulation also has a blank area.
The National Market Control Board conducted a series of national "quality month" activities in 2018, and journalists visited a 5-month-old centre in the city of Saizin to visit Mother's Health Service Certificate.
General monthly centres provide care for newborns, nutrition and postnatal rehabilitation services.
At the centre of the month, the journalist observed that nurses regularly check the situation of newborn infants, provide care services for new children, and special care services such as nursing.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of the new mother, the provision of care projects such as medical care, such as medical care, and help mothers to regain their ovaries.
A new mother who lived told the reporter that she had planned to attend this meeting just eight months earlier.
The monthly services projects directly affect the level of rest and physical recovery during the maternity months, and a few small months will provide only a few simple monthly services, the existence of non-standard drug health, the ease of the spread of infection, and the lack of science.
The head of the monthly centre said they were the only B-service certified in all five-month centres in the city of Saizon.
" Although some customers initially did not understand the meaning of the B-certificate, the process management of the firm's strict standardization process has made it important for clients to benefit from long-term long-term long-term development of enterprises, he said. "
The Deputy Director-General of the National Market Control Control Division said that service certification was based on customer awareness and that a new quality management and service-specific certification system was an important component of national quality infrastructure, which contributed to increased quality services and had a positive impact on international competitiveness of Chinese services.
Since the beginning of 2004, my country has experienced a ten-year development of the service certification project, a process where there has been no progressive development, and there has been such a financial service certification, maternity care certificate, post-sale marketing service certification, electronic business service certification, and a number of services that have a certain impact, such as a health service certification.
According to the National Market Control Board statistics, there are currently more than 130 certification agencies in my country, more than 2,000 certified persons, and nearly 8,000 valid certifications.
In order to further guide and promote the development of service certifications, it was suggested that a progressive expansion of the scope of service certification in areas such as health, education, sport, finance and electricity would help to promote the service sector for sectoral reform and quality improvement.
On 5 November, the price of Hong Kong Building fell two months later, and the President of the Hong Kong Financial Administration, Shandong, indicated that it is now necessary to monitor whether the city has entered the following cycle, if confirmed, to consider the emergency policy for the appropriate time-limited phase-out measures.
Chad also pointed out that if the price was reimbursed, it would first have been affected by people employed during the high season of construction, but it was expected that there would have been a price cut in the Asian financial storm in 1997 and that citizens would have very low sales opportunities.
The high-level legislative briefing of the High-level Board of Governors of Shandong showed that, if it was confirmed that the city entered the low-level cycle, it could be allowed to reoccurate on time.
"But it's only now that we see the data for a few weeks, that it's still early to relax, and it still takes time to see if the city gets into the next cycle."
Since 2009, the Board of Governors has launched eight round cycle measures to date to date, which have significantly reduced the number of types of industries, including the reduction of the number of turnover, which requires the applicant to be tested through severe pressure tests in order to increase bank risk management and resilience.
As Hong Kong officially entered the breakout cycle, the private housing price index for the two months from 8 September to 144 per cent continued to fall in September.
But the growth of the three months before this year is still 10.2 %.
According to the Authority's data, the financial situation in Hong Kong, which is still healthy with the financial impact of the financial risk mitigation capacity, is that 66 per cent of Hong Kong's households are undegradable in the second year, 60 per cent are higher than the average in 2009-11; the new allocations are made by averages and new rates of provision and incomes are significantly improved by 47 per cent and 34 per cent, respectively, and 64 per cent and 41 per cent for 2009-11.
However, Chandong pointed out that not representing high anti-terrorist power would not be affected by the economic downturn, as the economic value would fall and the people who bought high-end buildings would be more likely to attack them first.
While the Board of Governors receives a high amount of loans for loans by lenders, the borrower can also receive a high amount of loans by way of insurance insurance or by developers.
Chad has indicated that, together with the current loans made to the developer, the borrower can reach 85-90 per cent if the price falls (i.e., the value of the industrial market is below the level of the total loan).
However, the Vice-President of the Board of Governors pointed out that the authorities were estimated to provide a high-performance amount of debt, with only 2 to 2.5 per cent of the bank’s total amount of savings.
During the high-income period in Hong Kong in 2003, the number of assets is over 100,000, representing 22 per cent of the population of the building.
As in the third month of this year, Hong Kong continues to record zero assets.
On 1 October, New York City, China, received another tax benefit for the electronic commercial retail business on 1 October, related to value added tax and consumer tax exemptions.
The Ministry of Finance, the National Tax Administration, the Ministry of Commerce, the General Customs General, made it clear before the day of the joint publication of the Customs General, that the export of goods not effectively imported into the export of enterprises in the cross-border integrated electronic business zone has not been effectively imported into the market, while the following conditions are met:

Thirdly, export goods do not belong to the Ministry of Finance and the Directorate-General for Taxation, in accordance with the decision of the National Bureau, to abolish the export deduction (free) of goods.
It was made clear that the General Customs General had regularly declared electronic export goods to the National Tax Office of the List of Electronic Information on Exports to be reported regularly.
In the light of the information contained in the list of electronic information on export exemptions issued by the National Tax General Assembly, the tax authorities in the integrated zone have declared export exemptions to be enhanced.
It was noted that a specific free tax management approach was developed by the commercial and commercial sectors of the provincial tax sector.
The Office of the Steering Group of the Integrated Test Areas and the Business Managers should integrate communication collaboration and related policies into the sector, speed up the establishment of an electronic business export monitoring system to facilitate rapid development of cross-border business health.
On 5 November, a man in Mining's province, who was killed and killed by a man, subsequently fled to the self-governing area of Nemong.
On 5 days, the journalist was informed by the Public Security Bureau of the easternmost area of the city of Le Mongouldos that he was successfully arrested by two local police officers.
On 26 June 2018, a woman disappeared in the town of Hunan Province, where her family informed the local police.
This was not a simple case of the disappearance of the population, and it was quite likely that the missing person was killed by a beloved king, and that the police were immediately established to investigate further.
On 30 October, the Ad Hoc Group found that a suspected criminal king might have been hiding in the eastern part of the city of Chittos, where the East-West Police were organized by the Allied Police, in full cooperation with the Ninja police.
After five days of investigation, the civilian police finally cleared up the king's footsteps and took detailed precautions against his relations.
On 4 November, the two local police were able to arrest a suspect king in a search engine compartment in the Eastern Hemisphere.
According to a replacement of the king, he had a relationship with a white victim, and because of the fact that a white sister had a large amount of money stored under a white name, both decided to own the money.
On 22 June 2018, the King had a difference between a certain one and a white one because of the control of the funds, and the king had a white man killed in the rent, and a dead body had been separated.
At present, a suspected criminal king has been transferred to the Mininga Mountain Police.

Many local residents used vacations and goods, as well as well as well as a lot of Hong-in-backsportsports to the day, and in the moment as well as well as they had been able to get to access.
According to the data provided at the DPRK headquarters, as at 16 a.m., 42.9,000 persons were left on the ground, the number of transport vehicles reached 1.68,000 (e.g., round, line) and the number of always busy and undisclosed ports kept good access order.
It was understood that the increasing number of beneficial factors, such as countries that have been granted asylum-free policies for Chinese citizens, have continued to increase the use of travel leave to national holiday purchases, such as Europe and South-East Asia.
One morning, Rolai, deep-sea, queen, and far-reaching outside, as well as the Futland, arrived at a guest's (car) peak, where the Roo Lake coasters continued from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., deep-sea coastal (car) peaks from 6:30 a.m. to 13:00 a.m.
It was suggested that, in order to respond to the arrival of arrival passengers (cars), deep-seated border inspection posts were deployed in accordance with the National Immigration Authority, to launch a service mode at the time of departure, to organize additional police support lines for the operation, to advance the search, to lead passengers, to have a follow-up inspection, to ensure that Chinese citizens are able to enter the port chain for no more than 30 minutes, while maintaining the efficiency of foreign communication; and to strengthen the orderly maintenance of the cross-border region and ensure the security of the connection.

Travellers travelling to Hong Kong on a long-term high-level highway must keep effective exit documents and signatures, and high-speed tickets must not be used as a driving licence, as a reason for the failure to travel to Hong Kong because of the lack of access to it.
The systemic red blood cell is a chronic problem with a complex and complex multi-cellular body, which has been considered to have been called a " incurable disease " in the past.
Because of the lack of knowledge of their pathogens, it is difficult to address the lack of effective treatment.
In recent days, the United Nations Group of Directors of the Institute for Life Sciences of the University of California and the Director of the People's Hospital of Beijing has found that there is an increase in the incidence of human immunodeficiency in the human immunodeficiency virus, which is involved in the control of immune B cells.
In short, two groups have confirmed that an unusual immunizer in the human body is a major cause of systemic red blood cell disease.
According to one of the authors, the Northern People's Hospital reports that the Huguenot Group has collected and conducted studies of patients with systemic red blood cells that are close to 2000 samples, and that there has been a marked increase in the incidence and severity of diseases in the immune system and species, many of which are self-restraints, cirrhosis, cirrhosis, and haemorrhage.
Through immunization samples, animal testing and testing, various research methods, such immunization signals have been found that these immunizers have become increasingly active immunized pathways and have contributed to the spread of B cells by various self-containing mechanisms.
The journalists were aware that the two groups were strongly united, fully exercising their own preferences and achieved a close link between basic research and sexual applications.
Thousands of Libri groups are committed to the identification of B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-D-A-A-A-A-A-A-M-A-A-M-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-R-A-A-A-R-A-A-A-R-A-A-A-A-R-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A
" This study is one of the results of two teams' multi-year cooperation, as well as the recognition by the academic community of the first time in the mechanism that immuno-biotic proteins will often spread systemic red blood cells, setting a solid basis for further academic research and treatment of ovarians. "
It's not a short protection, it's a legal procedure.
Lawyer's wearing the head of the court?
It was really exciting to hear the news, and it was also blown up in the legal circle.
The law of the City of Fountain subsequently applied to the penalty of 500 lawyers and recommended that the City Law Association be investigated in writing.
Thus, according to a New York report, the law of the former state of Hawaii officially announced that the conduct of the two lawyers did not involve violations of law and did not punish them in accordance with the law.
It was reported from many sources that the treatment of the state-of-the-art law association was not short-term or counter-consumption, but that it was approved by the state-state council.
At the same time, it is possible to bring about an internal tension within the legal community, and finally to be dealt with in a proper manner.
The reverse is based on a more complete truth: the head of the defendant's lawyer is the same as that of the defendant's murder weapon, the same type, but is not open, supporting evidence only in the evidence series and without fear of the intention of "hazardous security of the court".
The determination of the violation of the law of law requires four important details of concern: for one, the local court had not been subjected to excessive or inappropriate use; for one, the local court had only exposed the head of the case to the defence, showed its need for the head of the head; for another, the head was to buy only one hour before the hearing; not to seek the consent of the judge; and for the other, the whole head had not been abused or abused; for the first time, the lawyer had been publicly denied recognition and made an apology to the court.
These cases are integrated, and they can be seen to be free of charge, just for defence.
After clarifying the whole fact, the U.S. City Laws did not give rise to water pollution, but it was a decision that had not been punished.
This decision is also subject to actual and legal testing.
As for without the permission of the Court, it would be easy to cause insecurity and misunderstanding as a control weapon.
In terms of security and careful consideration, the penalties and judicial recommendations of the former Central State Chamber are also in no way unreasonable.
In order to protect the dignity of lawyers, to prevent individual courts from being punished for misconduct, the Supreme Law issued in 2014 the " Rules for the Safety of the Courts of Justice Police " and established the principle that the courts do not need to carry out self-security checks.
Since the issue of this rule, large lawyers have been conducting very few cases of security threats to the Tribunal's safety because of the lack of security.
In very different cases, such as the U.S., it is not difficult to eliminate the misunderstanding of the spirit of mutual respect, understanding, and understanding.
The Law Association, as a self-legislative organization in the law sector, undertakes double sentences of illegal and legal guarantees.
In the past, individual law organizations have suffered from excessive punishment, loss of security and disease.
However, the decision of the state law agreement, whether it is from the process or the outcome, is worthy of commendation and is a model for more law-making.
From 1 October, what tax benefits will affect our money bags?
The new tax law on 1 October in the New York Sea (New Zealandan journalist San Juan) will be implemented on 1 January 2019 in order to allow the large population to benefit from the reduction of tax benefits as soon as possible, and from 1 October it will be preceded by the removal of the payroll actually earned by taxable persons at the beginning of the month of the month and the application of the new tax table.
What are the benefits of accompanying the new political landscape that will affect the money pockets of the population?
Benefit I: The reduction in wage salaries is clearly evident
A taxable person who receives salary after 1 October may remove the basic reduction costs of $5000/month and apply a new tax scale, with the majority of taxable persons having different levels of reduction, in particular the volume of the reduction of low-income.
According to the tax reduction table for different income groups, the deduction of the monthly income after "three-risk" was $8,000, $10,000, $20,000, $50000, followed by a reduction of $90, $290, $1590, $9,90, compared with $3500 per month, respectively, was 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.0%, 18.8%.
It is worth noting that for reasons of holiday holidays, a new basic cost-reduction and tax-rate table could be applied to salaries to be issued by each unit to be issued by the end of September in accordance with the law.
In order to do so, the client terminal software used in the tax sector has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax still needs to be declared during the statutory declaration period.
Beneficiary 2: Low rate file level is clearly wide
In addition to raising points, a new tax scale will be applied on 1 October.
This salary, which is consistent with the seven file rates received in advance, has not changed, but has changed significantly, 3%, 10%, 20% of the lower tax rate, 25% of the lower tax level, and 30%, 35% and 45% of these three higher rates remain unchanged.
It is worth noting that the tax law has also adjusted the rates of the taxes on production operations, with a minimum of 35 per cent of which is higher than $100,000 to $5 million.
This means that individuals' businesses will benefit from tax adjustments.
" From the previous period, in view of the individual assessment of tax reductions for persons at sea, all taxable persons will be fully aware of the benefits of tax reform, especially those of low-income groups. "
The Head of the Tax Office, who received the personal tax office at the National Tax Office at the Maritime Tax Office, expressed sympathy for the person.
Benefit III: Faster improvements in tax services
Since the publication of the new tax law, a wide range of tax collection campaigns have been carried out in the maritime tax sector.
On the one hand, focusing on policy promotions of "one to one point point" to focus on tax sources.
The new tax agency in the new Prussian region has previously visited the Coalition Trade Ltd (OCT), the Pay (China) Network Technology Limited, large enterprises such as the Red Cross Group ' s resident group limited companies, many of which were employees, large-scale employees, large-scale taxation, tax incentives, and the tax sector's initiative to raise objections; the Tax Administration has visited the vast financial consultancy firm in large-scale enterprises in the region, intellectually working companies in the Mediterranean economy, and the time to collect business concerns, to respond to corporate demand, to deal with business difficulties.
On the other hand, tax collection policies are being promoted to large-scale citizens, "wide, multi-level, institutionalized" tax collection policies.
Use the official website of the overseas tax office, microconference channels, and microbot channels to ensure policy awareness.
At the same time, on 28 September, the High Sea Tax Micro-Communication Advisory Platform 12366 was conducted through the "human + intelligent" tax services, through the "integrate-type" information services for integrated tax reform.

For England to be the greatest honor of my career, 120 times, I will also be the last time for England, and for me, this will be a special reminder."

According to external media reports, a joint statement by Canada's Foreign Minister Friland and the United States Trade Representative of Latvia, published by the Government of Canada, was that the United States, Canada and Mexico reached a triangular trade agreement, which would be called " USMCA " (United States of America) .

As a result of an advance flu election in the morning of the local time for the death of a former informant patient, Danny, who was successfully elected against the plans to move to the United States Army base, was successfully elected.
This election was held on 30 September, with a result of a total of 39.66.3 million votes, with the highest number of historical and historical elections in the West Bank, and more than 80,000 votes in favour of the main elections against the leaders.
A total of four candidates participated in this election, with a vote of 63.24 per cent, with a decrease of 0.89 per cent compared to the 2014 FC elections.
On 1 May, the mayor indicated to the media that the results of the elections indicated that the villagers did not want to raise awareness of the cost of their efforts prior to life, and that he would have inherited the legacy of knowledge and continued to work towards the Government of Japan and the Government of the United States of America on the closure of plans against the U.S. military base and the closure of the universal bases.
The U.S. base is located in the city of Guangdong and has been stricken with illness. The Government of the United States has previously agreed to move it to the coastal area of the city of refuge, but the population of the Guangdong is strongly opposed and hopes that the base will be completely excommunicated.
However, with regard to the highly opposed movement plan of the villagers and the request for the removal of the coastal coastal permit for seabed construction, the mayor indicated that he had not, at first, had no position and that the central government was in opposition and had hoped that the parties could exchange their views fully and indicated the intention of resolving through consultations.
The Japanese Prime Minister also expressed to the media that he would take this result seriously and would make efforts to rehabilitate and reduce base load.

Since the mid-2000s, with China growing oil demand, Paul Thomas, a farmer in North Dakota, U.S.A., has grown more and more.
This transition has reached the highest peak this year, and he has produced 1,600 litres of beer in 5,000 acres and has reached an unprecedented size.
But Thomas and many farmers like him, like him, transferred their main crops in the former U.S. agricultural district in 2019: corn and milk.
This year, American farmers overcrowded the large vegetable plant, for the first time in 35 years.
It is therefore planned to transfer other food crops because, in the context of the start of the war against China, U.S. farmers are facing difficulties in selling large beans.
China usually buys about 60 per cent of the US exports of beans, but in recent months it has been almost zero for the United States, resulting in a decline in the price of tobacco to 10 years.
Thomas intends to increase the quality of the next year, and he hopes that, by reducing the dependence on crops that depend on China's needs, there will be more.
Thomas points out that the high price of beer " brings us a painful battle " .
He pointed out that, without China's purchase, the wholesale price near its farm was $7.10 per ear, and that the cost required was $8.50.
The U.S. farmer collects a high level of production and is expected to have a high level of production this year.
At such a time when it was so easy to get hit, they had a fight for trade.
In July China collected import tariffs for imported Chinese goods for imported large American beans.
The United States Department of Agriculture will publish the first forecasting report on crops in the coming year, which will include an overview of the impact of tariffs.
The estimate is expected to confirm that civil institutions are expected to reduce the presence of large-scale explosives.
According to a report on 19 October, Information Economics is expected to increase by 4 to 9.7 million pounds (3.7 million kg) in 2019 and by 7 to 8.3 million pounds in large quantities.
The information is also expected to increase by 4 per cent.
This year, the large surface of the pre-repetition tariff increases to 8.9.6 million pounds, with an increase of approximately 15 million pounds 10 years ago.
The growth of corn plants has increased from less than 5 million pounds since 2008 to 8.9 million pounds, and this year the growth of small plants is 4.78 million pounds, reaching a minimum rate of almost 100 years.
Aaron Carlson, director of the Ilynoia Canal Farming Association, has a total of 3,600 pounds. This year he spent nearly half of his crops on plants, but plans to reduce the future.
He said that it was likely that the farm in which he lived in northern Illinois would grow to a maximum of 20 per cent; it was the largest plant country in the United States.
The total cost of growing bees is lower than that of wheat, but the demand for cereals is also lower than the total cost of growing.
A farmer's transfer to final raw milk may increase costs, but it will benefit some businesses, including Andersons Incensive.
Andersons, Executive Director Pat Bowe, indicated that he was expected to turn corn into flour for use in the drying process.

Newwa International Time Review: Protecting multilateralism, China's Knowledge Unit.
Under unilateral revolutions, international rules and multilateral order were under attack.
To some extent, the transition between unilateralism and multilateralism entered a critical period.
As a responsible country, China has been in a position to promote multilateralism in a manner consistent with the concept of universality and powerful actions, jointly with the international community.
In the face of new challenges, China made a loud voice about the development direction and ways of multilateralism.
As the Prime Minister of State and Foreign Affairs has said in the general debate of the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, modern multilateralism should continue to be pursued in cooperation on the basis of a rule-based order and to lead to effective action in a just and just manner.
At the same time, China called for the construction of the United Nations as a core, North-South cooperation as the main channel, and for South-South cooperation to complement the global development cooperation framework, and called on the parties to work together to build a community for human fate.
China's thinking and voice reflected the leading voice of the international community.
True to the words of the 73rd President of the General Assembly, Espinosa, under the present situation, " the United Nations needs to promote multilateralism and maintain the international system based on rules " .
The President of the International Monetary Fund, Lagad, stated that the international community should continue to maintain strict adherence to the multilateral trading system, to adhere to international trade rules, and to resolve differences through consultation.
In recent years, with a comparison of global economic forces, a number of emerging markets and groups of developing countries have played a greater role in international multilateral mechanisms to provide new development incentives for counter-warming multilateralism.
On this level, China's promotion of building a large family rather than a small circle of circles, and maintaining a shared community rather than a winner's share of multilateralism, and in due course a stream of time to address global challenges, and of course to solve world problems, representing the common demand of most countries in the world.
There's progress, there's more serious action.
China's "one-way" initiative has become the largest international cooperation platform.
China's joint " one road " , the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the International and Regional Cooperation Initiative " 16+1 " to promote international cooperation in the region, to complement the existing international system and order, to bring innovation to multilateral cooperation and to contribute to a more equitable approach to development in order to promote international order.
China's actions are increasingly stronger at this multilateral level, as international sponsors and practitioners of multilateralism.
High international warming, climate change, participation in peacekeeping operations, substantial poverty reduction, and assistance to other countries in the implementation of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.
China has become an important pillar of multilateralism, as the Secretary-General of the United Nations said.
When the world's "trust deficit" has been increased, democracy and exterminating trends are the most pressing times in the world's demand for multilateral cooperation.
In such historical contexts, the international community needs to take action to bring consensus into action, to strengthen multilateralism and to promote the building of a community for the death of mankind.

The fifth "frequency Day" came to focus on the problem of disability in youth education - the new network.
In recent years, the issue of adolescent education in China has been widely discussed, but the challenges remain high for young people with disabilities.
In the near future, the comprehensive educational challenges of disabled persons and practical strategy seminars were held in Beijing.
How to conduct sexual education for disabled children and young people as an important topic for this seminar.
A report on attitudes and behaviors of children with disabilities in China, published at the meeting, shows that children with disabilities suffer from sexual harassment and sexual abuse are higher than healthy children.
In the case of children with disabilities, young people are also more concerned with "sexual protection" in society.
This seminar aims at providing support for family support, school education, institutional services in third countries to promote comprehensive education for disabled children and adolescents in China, from the outset providing support for disabled children and young people, to give them and their neighbors the right to enjoy their own love.
The experts believe that China's public awareness of disabled groups has been maintained at a low level since then.
The impact of traditional ideas on persons with disabilities, especially children with disabilities and adolescents, has not yet been fully integrated into comprehensive education.
In recent years, however, with the support of the United Nations UNESCO and the public, there has been a happy development in the overall cycle of sexual and reproductive health education and the achievement of ways of achieving the cycle of full development of persons with disabilities in China.
"Report" shows that barriers, barriers to understanding and understanding between children and young people will be more difficult than common people, but in general, it has been accelerated and developed.

The previous data from the central line showed that as at the end of August last year, foreign currency had an amount of $60.44 million for the long-term and long-term contracts, which remained unchanged for the fourth month; the first value of the SDR (special appropriation) was 42.76 million SDR.
After that, the long-term head of the central line has been zero.
The Central Line first released that data at the end of March 2016; data show that foreign currency held at the end of February 2016 was more than $24.38 million for the long-term and long-term contracts for this currency, which amounted to $289 million.

On the night of 20 September this year, K158 on a train went to the wall of a three-year-old jockey-school car in Zhao State.

Two hours' drive, the head of the car took him an hour off.
Finally, a man's passenger with a car can't look down on his grandfather.
From the point of view, although most of the results were ultimately condemned by the public, the administrative punishment of the public sector, and even included in the list of true faiths, the public still felt that " hatred " was not allowed to be punished by the public:
Why can't the place stop its immorality and even illegal acts, and then be punished?
And why is it that just a man "sees the wrong way"?
The main reason for this is that only long-distance vehicles are equipped with police and short-distance vehicles are not generally available; even if there are drivers, police are concerned about the possible independent response of those sitting in the seat.
The repeated incidents of torture have made it clear that it is necessary to force the offenders to be forced out of the camp until they are punished.
This requires that our train police be given the courage to take strong measures at the right time, and that without the trainers should be set up as soon as possible in order to ensure a full time to stop and combat violations.

The new brands also provide detailed provisions on sampling requirements for secondary school football courses, testing rules and determining rules.
In addition, for the first time, school-age workers were included in the national markings for compulsory testing.
In recent years, targeted work on the implementation of the new national labels will be deployed and the Department of Sports and Art Education will report on the implementation of the new national labels within the year.

Tin and Juju are friends and friends, both of whom are familiar with each other's techniques.
Whether it's a game or a game's hot, both of them look like a show.
In the entrance to the contest, the two of them expressed inconsistencies that they had completed the contest.
But the higher the level between the middle of the competition and the rain.
Firstly, the great experience of the race is the three:1 lead, and then the fall of the rain will follow the 3 level.
Then the flood began to increase in the failure of the attack, and the chance of capture was three-point 9:5, and at 10:6 a.m.
Ding, although the rain was three minutes late, Dinn still took the lead with 11:9.
Second, the failure of rainflakes remains high, and Tinn is based on the advantage between them at 6:1 a.m.
In the event that rain falls after 2:7, the cycle changes by 2 minutes, and then the use of the attack will be divided by 8:9.
It's a key time. Ting's two-point 11:8.
The third floor, the two of them have a higher rate of weight than 3:3.
Dingin then lost more than three points in the attack, but she then used 3 points to track down 6 levels.
The rain level is 2 times the advantage, and at 10.8 degrees the position is taken first.
But Dinn's attack was violent, and after four minutes, it turned out to be 12:10.
Fourth floor, the Rainbow Station was headed at 4:2.
But later, there was a superfluous attack, even after four minutes of rain.
After a pause, the rain came back to a few conditions, gradually to track to 8:8 pm.
It's a crucial moment. There's no hand. Two minutes to win.
When the rain came back to the ball, Tinn 4:0 took his hand off.
In the past month, Dininy had taken up his career in Bulgaria and ended up in a 14-month siege, although she indicated that she had not set the goal of fighting this race before, but in the final half of the morning, he said that he had completed his mission.
The final winner of the Ninth War team, who won the Third World Cup, was satisfied with her performance: "A champion is important to every activist.
I didn't think of it before, just say a place to pull, decide to play or be very pleased."
She said, "I think that the whole game I've been dealing with is still a great deal of pressure, and today's tennis is so great that I don't have a lot of fun."
Active rural consumption, based on conventional mechanisms for the clean-up of markets, leads to health needs and increases access to agricultural consumption.
The data show that the potential for sustainable release of the consumption of rural inhabitants has increased by 10.5 per cent in the first half of the year and increased by 1.3 per cent in urban areas.
In a poor village in the western part of the country, there's only one luxury shop in the village, some goods seem to have been known, "The Golden Fish" marked "Golden" , "Wank" became "Wankah " , and a lot of" goods.
In recent years, similar phenomena have appeared, a number of rural holiday brands have been named, known as close, packaged with similar brands, which have proved to be effective and preventable.
A consumer survey published in one Western city revealed that rural merchants had serious problems with supermarkets, and 66 per cent of the users had bought over-markets under urban borders, with more than half of them eating.
The sector in question has managed the rural market. It's called annual. Why don't "Leagan" still fight?
In contrast with the urban market, the awareness of agricultural rights is relatively weak, as well as a number of rural locations, which are limited to control areas where there is insufficient control and allow counterfeit goods to inherit land.
A commodity has multiple capitals, sectoral prices, productions, markets, functional dividends, annual holidays, the central government of the air, counterfeits, and slow flights, just finished holidays, and new holidays.
Lack of long-acting control mechanisms, difficult rural markets to clean up, low costs, and high interest rates have led some illegal traders to trade in the top mountains, and some rural areas become " waste markets " .
From warm to small, large farmers are focusing on development.
In the past, the State Department issued a series of views on improving the capacity of consumers to increase their consumption potential " , which proposed a gradual increase in the consumption of rural people with a view to enabling large farmers to consume " willing consumption " and to make rural consumption more attractive.
On the one hand, there is a need to deepen the reform, eliminate market regulation by multiple doors, multi-manage thresholds, supply of healthy food security, product quality monitoring networks, constantly restricting rural vacations and marketing spaces.
On the other hand, in order to increase law enforcement, the regulation of " mass-blood control " has not been allowed to spread abroad by fraud.
The severe penalty for farming is the protection of farmers, and no matter how hidden the falsifiers are, it should not be a reason for the birth of falsified goods. The relevant sectors should be given clear responsibility, under the authority of the basic regulatory authority, and the issue of the division is to follow the responsibility of the falsification, and the seller is not to be hidden.
Strong market access, strict review of the quality of the operators, access to market flows, road to products, road to roads, starting from the beginning and starting ways of thinking, ensuring the safety of legitimate sellers, and the security of farmers.
Active rural consumption, leading to health needs.
With increased consumption, many farmers are not only seeking food, food, and quality lives such as culture and health, but are unable to paint the rural market with low-quality "prices".
This requires promoting the expansion of electronic commerce to large rural areas, promoting the combined channels of sales of both towns, facilitating the integration of industrial development platforms and online trading platforms, and supporting the growth of new business patterns into rural markets; promoting the combination of trade flows and recreational agriculture, rural tourism and product processing; and improving the quality of modern rural transport network resources and effectively reducing rural transport costs.
Building a clean and relaxed market environment for rural camps and reducing farmers' consumption and increasing rural consumption can increase their access to and happiness.

The first joint investigation of Korea into the sea in 65 years
The Ministry of National Defence confirmed on 5 days that Korea had launched a joint investigation into the coastal waters that day.
The initiative was prepared to ensure the free movement of civil ships by both parties.
The National Defence Ministry of Korea provided the press a briefing on that day, showing that it was the first joint investigation of the port of Huang in the sea since the signing of the Korean War Treaty in 1953.
Korea had signed a military agreement this year in September, and agreed to undertake a joint survey of water entering the sea, such as in November, in order to ensure environmental protection for the water area and to develop tourism after the day.
In October, Korea planned a joint water survey at the General Military Conference.
On 5 November, Korea's joint water review was officially launched.
The Joint Inspection Mission consists of 20 members of the Korean military, including experts.
According to the Ministry of National Defence of Korea, both parties were not carrying weapons and were prohibited from using incentives to the contrary.
" Since there were no military separations near the seaside, the region had been an accidental high-level zone, but through joint examination, it would be a new peace zone in the future. "
This time, the Korean Joint Research Area, approximately 70 kilometres, totalled approximately 280 square kilometres.
The Ministry of Defence of Korea introduced that Korea would conduct only 6 surveys of the depth of sea water and provide basic information on water safety navigation; after the investigation was completed, it would provide a map of navigation for civil ships.
Korea had held a summit meeting in Pittsburgh in October 2007, with agreement on the joint use of the bridge and the crossing into the sea, but the follow-up negotiations were slowed down because of the tension on the island.
In accordance with the military agreement signed by Korea in September, future vessels of both sides need to inform each other in advance before they travel in the common waters.
On 5 November, the Chinese Embassy website in Mongolia reported on 4 days, and in the near future, Chinese citizens lost their homes and their homes during the monasteries.
It was understood that two Blue Relief Team members, on 19 October, had indicated that they had been contacted by domestic relatives, that they were about to enter the mountains near the Kusugular Lake, and that they had shared their location with a micro-confidential group, who had lost contact and had apparently gone to no-one.

The security of the two missing people always touched our hearts.
Two people have been missing for more than ten days, and the mission continues to receive some clues, but they have not been found, and the rescue operation is still under stress.
The Embassy will continue to pay constant attention to this matter, to continue its efforts to save the country, and to provide maximum assistance to the families of the parties.
The Embassy called on Monsignor and Enterprises to contact China's Embassy in Mongolia for the first time if they were to learn about the relevant guidelines.
