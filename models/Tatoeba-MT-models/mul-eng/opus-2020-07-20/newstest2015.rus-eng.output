FANO Russia will hold the final expert session
The Federal Science Organizations Agency (FANO Russia) will, together with RAN, hold the third expert session, " Evaluating the effectiveness of the activities of scientific organizations " .
The meeting will be finalized in the series of meetings held by the agency during the year, in the press release of the editor of the Lent.Ru.
The third meeting plans to submit the results of the expert session annually and to draw up a list of indicators for assessing the results of scientific organizations.
The participants plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for the evaluation of the work of the scientific groups and the evaluation criteria.
The third expert session will be a final event for the development of a uniform approach for all three academics to the methodology for assessing the effectiveness of the activities of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have succeeded, and the resulting version of the normative documents is in agreement.
At the end of the next session, we must complete the process of scientific and expert analysis, agree on the phases and timing of the evaluation," said the head of the FANO expert-analytical management of Russia, Elena Aksenov.
More representatives of Russia' scientific institutions will take part in the event.
As a result, the resolution is expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin on 10 a.m. by Moscow time on 16 September 2014 at the address: Moscow City, Solanka Street, house 14.
Scientists have found ways to discover family stars
Astrophysicists from the California University of Santa Cruz studied turbulence and its impact on chemical unity in stars.
It is expected that the opening of experts will allow for the search of relatives by the star, that is, from one cluster.
The results of their research have been published in Nature magazine and can be found on the university’s website.
The cause of the same chemical composition of nearby stars is a disturbing shift in the areas of gas before the formation of stars.
Even if the birth of the star then leaves the star cluster, the chemical composition of it can determine the place of birth and the region of education of the star family.
The scientists had previously doubted that the evolution of the stars outside the classroom could lead to a distinction in its chemical content from that of the family members in the classroom.
Astrophysicist modeling results show that such differences should not occur.
In their study, the supercomputer has modeled two streams of interstellar gas, which together formed clouds.
This object has been transformed into a class for several million years under its own gravity, where the stars begin to form.
Scientists have added grass-tags to the original gas flows and have found that rapid turbulence in the cloud reaches a high level of chemical unity.
Astrophysicists believe, their research has shown that the chemical composition of stars and the possible regions of such objects can be sought.
Carat police arrested 20 years after the high-speed motorcycle
The motorcycle was confiscated after crossing at a speed of 125 km/h in a zone with a speed limit of 70 km/h and through Bushland to hide from the police in Pilarbar.
The police patrol in Karate tried to stop a deep motorcycle this morning, discovering that his speed reached 125 km/h when he left the Batgate Road service station.

Lavro: Russia will not be "stitching the door" for new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not "stitch the door" for new sanctions.
The Head of the MD RF Sergey Lavrov, speaking to the students and teachers of the IGIMO, has said this today.
As a result of our response to the new wave of anti-virus sanctions, I will not even discuss, imagine, because everything has to be calculated specifically, he said.
And when we understand what European and American partners will do this time, we will decide how to respond.
It's not going to be related to the press door, any attempts that are misinformed, the Minister emphasized.
We will, first of all, withdraw from our interests in order to protect our economy, our social sphere, our citizens, our business and to draw conclusions from the actions of partners in terms of their adequacy, contractuality and reliability.
As a result of the action taken in the area of sanctions, it is possible to judge very well what partners are getting - the Head of the MDG.
If they say in all voice that "the sanctions will also be sick for us, but we have to go to Russia to punish," that is probably not enough."
With regard to the FIFG's issue in response to the possible new sanctions, it is not.
On the contrary, we would like to further develop the WTO instrument, including when it comes to trade disputes, Lavrov said.
We have already used this tool to overcome, as we believe, the EU's discriminatory policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the Minister, Russia has been accused of dumping and has applied anti-dumping measures against RF economies.
"We are ready for WTO mechanisms and in order to resist our position on the inability to apply the rules of the third EU energy package retrospectively," Lavrov said.
How is the cheese properly used in the garden?
Irina Okuneva answers the questions:
Since the cheese has lost its main appeal, it is desirable to raise it together with other artists.
It's beautiful with many cultures.
It is possible, therefore, that the cheese can and should be grown at other times as well as at the same time.
Another more cheese is that it provides a mass of creative opportunities.
You can form it with a different height of wood, with a better thickness, a thick layer with a broad base, and even a garden bonsa with a magnificently decorated glass.
Just choose the shape that is more suitable for your garden design.
The Leningrad area is convicted of money laundering in Karelia
According to the Republican MWD, the man was involved in his criminal activity in the Olonec and Segeg districts.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already succeeded in inheriting the Voloyear area, where he has been sentenced to two and a half years of deprivation of liberty this year.
Later, the man was brought before the Olonec District Court.
And for the end of the crimes committed in our Republic, it was staged in Segeg.
In the investigation, wines were shown to have been collected for several episodes of cash loss related to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June this year, criminal material was sent to the court at the end of the sentence.
On Friday, 29 August, the Court decided to replace the term of deprivation of liberty for four years with a stay in the general regime.
The sentence did not enter into force legally.
Remember, for the past week, two other money changers were convicted of fraud, which they had been paid in Peter’s warehouses.
Azerbaijani citizens also arrived in Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them lost five years of freedom, the other four.
Each was assigned a fine of 500 thousand rubles.
The sentence has not yet entered into force.
The 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first "Dervish"
Mitting, which was located in the center of the area, was referred to the first Arctic Circle.
"Dervish" provided military assistance in the US and Great Britain to the SSR.
In the Archangelic Metting, a memorial was passed in the castle of the future memory of the participants of the northern convoy, located on the wall of Sedova in Solombal.
The meeting was attended by representatives of the Veteran organizations of Arhangelska, children of the academic class.
First, we met twenty-three years ago when a stone was placed.
But today's event is also not a holiday, but a day to remember those who have not returned to the sea," noted the president of the North Marine Council of Veterans Boris Carpov.
Then the city’s spiritual orchestra was presented, and the academics gave flowers to the veterans and marched along with the Russian flag and the victory.
Mitting ended up putting the flowers in the locker.
The crew itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch carrier loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of shaped boots, oil, iron and many other inventory and equipment).
In addition, there were 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines on the ship, and 15 Harreyen bombers were in a position to be understood.
At the same time, the fleet consisted of 16 United Kingdom WMF ships, of which two aircraft were pilots.
Charavan was not identified by the opponent and came to the point of destination - Arhangelska.
Of the 848 ships involved in life-threatening operations, 126 vessels and about 50 military vessels were killed.

I remember the very American idea that labour rights are human rights
The Congressmen of Kit Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill on which the trade union organization was protected as a civil law.
"Where the trade unions are, there are jobs in the middle class," says Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota, who is co-chaired by the Congress of the Progressive Group.
That is why I am proud to present the Act on the increase in the rights of workers together with the symbol of the movement of civil rights by John Luis.
This innovative bill provides workers with the same legal opportunities for the organization of trade unions, which, in other forms of discrimination, retains the strength of opponents of trade unions
Amendment of the Labour Relations Act so as to enable workers who are discriminated against to participate in trade unions to seek justice in civil courts and receive compensation for damages and tax payments - a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative, at least according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to discuss what Ellison, Luis and the sponsors of the bill are to remember is to remember the very American idea.
Despite the attacks the United States has faced in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries around the country, Americans have at times supported the world-wide efforts to accept, expand and respect labour rights.
It was a time when millions of Americans would still remember when that country at the same time protected democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to an organization.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas MacArthur and his assistants helped the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that Hiddeki Todzjo's war machine was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in creating a new Japan, they included a text that directly acknowledged that "the right of workers to organized, negotiated and collective action is guaranteed".
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General David Eisenhauer and his assistants helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that the fascism of Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new State, Germany included an article which declared publicly: “The right to establish associations to protect and improve labour and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each person and every profession or field of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to undermine this right will not have legal power; measures aimed at these purposes will be recognized as unlawful.
When Eleanor Rusvelt, former President of the International Commission on Human Rights, formed the World Declaration on Human Rights, which will be adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Russell and its constituents included the assurance that “every person has the right to organize and enter a trade union to protect his or her interests”.
American families have adopted the basic rule that labour rights are human rights.
When that country consulted other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to trade unions - and that the union to participate as a equal partner in collective negotiations with corporations and government agencies - should be protected.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is wise, indeed, to return to the American idea that workers should have the right to an organization and that their voices should be heard in a free and open society.
As Martin Luther King said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the union movement did not slow down the strength of the nation but increased them.
The lower standard of living for millions of people, the trade unions have created markets for industry and have raised the entire nation at an unprecedented level of production.
Those who attack the trade unions forget these simple truths, but history reminds them.
History reminds us of how well we are.
Official recognition of labour rights as human rights and the expansion of the protection of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions has long been seen.
Kitt Ellison and John Lewis reborn ideas that have historically expanded America and made a promise of democracy.
The judge temporarily blocks a law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the United States, the federal judge temporarily blocked the entry into force of the law of Louisiana, which his party said would close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed by Governor Lucian Bobby Ginadlom in June and was to enter into force on 1 September, doctors who are abortions would be required to have the authority to receive patients in the hospital 30 miles of their practice.
However, the decision of the judge means that at this moment doctors may continue to perform legal abortions, continuing to seek such authority.
“The investigators will be allowed to work lawfully, continuing to exercise authority,” wrote Judge John DeGrewells in his decision.
The hearing will be held within a month when the judge will make a more permanent decision under this law.
The right defenders of abortions happily met this decision, last in line with similar measures, saying that this would give doctors more time to obtain medical authorization.
“Today’s decision ensures that Louisianan women will be protected from the cover law, which seeks to deprive them of their health and rights,” said Nancy Norpat, President and Director of the Reproductive Rights Centre, who applied for the termination of the law by three of the five state hospitals.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision to two doctors who had not made a complaint on the case and to make an application for approval had been made.
Louisiana belongs to 11 States that have adopted such laws and have recently recognized such measures as non-institutional measures in Alabama and Mississippi.
The key parts of the Texas law, which would close most of the remaining clinics in that state, were blocked by the federal judge on Friday.
The fight against the right to abortion, together with the American College of Acoustics and GI, and the American Medical Association, states that adoption powers are imposed on doctors that are not necessary from a medical point of view.
Anti-absorbants claim that such measures are aimed at the protection of women's health, although some have also noted their positive effect on the closure of the clinic.
The Center for Reproductive Rights has been informed only by one doctor who has an abortion in Louisiana.
If all the remaining doctors in the state had to stop carrying out this procedure, the doctor, fearing for his safety, would have ceased to carry out this procedure, the group reported.
Criticizing this decision, the Luizian officials said that doctors who had abortions would not be punished until their statements had been made.
What will lead to the introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of the products in each type of goods in the commercial networks should be Russian production, the Gösdomi, of the Russian Federation, believes that Oleg Nilov.
The Parliament prepared a draft law aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, which was written in the Journal of the Information.
The document will be further detailed in order to avoid possible discounts for buyers.
This concerns goods that are not produced in Russia, and according to the other groups of products that are produced in Russia, the reteller will have to provide at least half of its spare parts to domestic producers," Nilov reported.
In conjunction with the amendments to the article “On the basis of the State Trade Regulation in the RFB”, the draft legislation provides for amendments to the Tax Code setting the decline rate of NDS by 10 per cent in the implementation of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50 per cent quota into trade networks is a package of stimulating measures for Russian producers.
There will be a number of more household items on the docks.
However, the initiative may have both a positive and a negative effect, experts say.
According to the lawyer of the company Nalogovick, a member of the independent expert centre of the General Duma, Sergei Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food sectors, will have a positive effect and will lead to growth.
In addition, there will be farmers, farmers, small shops.
They can sell more, which means the profit will grow.
They will also have the right to dictate their conditions and prices, as they will have to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to scale their activities and sales, resulting in higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenue, create new jobs, some industries will start to expand, some of which will be rapidly gaining, and will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will be reduced several times, indeed, not immediately," the expert noted.
Former Russian companies were often unable to catch local stores because of high competition by foreign analogues.
Now, after the embargo was introduced, the snow was released and it could be lifted with relief.
However, it should not be forgotten that, following all necessary agreements and health checks on the Russian market, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will be produced.
In other words, it's now a moment of pleasure when the old games have gone, and the new ones haven't arrived yet.
Less than a month later, it can be said that the demand for domestic goods and the price for ready-to-produced production is growing, " - AIF.ru, the first Vice-President of the Russian public organization ' s Russian Financial Director ' s Club, K.E. Tamara Casyanova.
The idea of selling in each category at least 50 per cent of Russian food products will strengthen the sector for local producers.
In that case, they will compete with each other rather than with goods that are subject to the subsidies of another State.
In other words, the fight against buyers would arise between companies working under the same industry laws.
On the other hand, Kasyanov notes that Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the internal needs of stakeholders not far from all the articles.
In this situation, the trade networks have to "attach" the share of Russian goods to half the assortment.
As a result, there is growing fear that counterfeit goods will be produced.
It is possible that foreign products with broken labels will be placed under the type of products produced in Russia," the expert adds.
The negative impact of quota introduction is felt by large trading networks, especially those that benefit from cooperating with importers.
It is reasonable that, in such a schedule, foreign suppliers themselves would suffer as demand for their production would decline.
Lithuania does not exclude that the quota law on domestic goods may also affect consumers.
The fact is that some Russian production products can be imported as analogues, while stores can generate prices for the second, such as the missing goods.
In early 2000 the idea of importation was re-examined by the economists in February of this year because of the continued decline in the rubella.
As a result of a lack of relations with the West, the issue of withdrawal from import products is becoming even more relevant.
The Act calls on producers to be considered to be domestic manufacturers when making orders for suppliers.
We will then be much faster and more confident on the way to import and the production planning system will be established within a shorter period of time," said the Oleg Nilov.
A particularly effective quota mechanism will be for agricultural sectors where capacity is particularly high, for example in the milk sector, where the proportion of imports was 25 per cent.
Our farmers are really able to fully cover the catch of Russian stores.
In addition, strong pulses can also produce meat.
As is known, the largest proportion of imports remain per capita - from 30% to 35%.
65-70 per cent is still coming to Russia's production," Cassianov argues.
Experts were of the view that the introduction of quotas on domestic products would facilitate imports and could speed up the process.
However, the initiative itself does not lead to import, as it requires a set of measures, believed in in Lithuania.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold under this initiative may be imported from the border, which means that full import will not occur, but substantial steps will be taken in this direction.
In addition, quotas should be set up in the country for domestic production to meet these quotas.
These quotas as soon as they guarantee and provide such guarantees," the expert concludes.
Immediate diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolly and her brother James published a video to remember their quiet mother, who died in the hands of the janitors in 2007.
Women who live in rural Australia face a higher risk of death than those who live in cities.
Researchers analyzed the disease maps of more than 1100 Australian women with ovarian cancer diagnosis in 2005 and found that 35 per cent lived five years after diagnosis.
Chief researcher Susan Jordan of the Institute for Medical Studies QIMR Berghofer reported that the probability of death during the study was 20 per cent higher for those living in regions and remote parts of the state than for those living in urban areas.
NEGATIVE REQUIREMENTS: New medicines can relieve the cancer of mild and ovarian cancer
The researchers have followed the path of women’s health for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of kidney cancer, current diseases and socio-economic status also affected the risk of survival.
Women older and those with cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote parts of the state, the risk of death during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of lung cancer, Dr. Jordan had suggested that unsustainable diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynecological oncology, and they are mainly in major cities," she said.
Despite increasing the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that an increase in the number of exit services that would allow professionals to treat women closer to home and support programmes for people who were being treated far from home could be helpful.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of the geographical situation, the study found that the length of life between women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Gold Coast, Elisha Niv, said that she had an aggressive handcuff.
A new FAP opened the door in September in the Kugener region
The construction of the medical institution in Toktybelak village began in April of this year and was based on a typical project.
The value of the work was almost 10 million rubles.
According to the management of public communications and information, the financing of the construction of the facility was carried out through the Republican budget in accordance with the local investment programme.
The total area of the medical institution is approximately 230 square metres.
Here they will provide medical assistance to the inhabitants of eight population points: the village of Toktibelak and the village of Dementievo, Puncerumal, Tunisia, Fomici, Toribelek, Shinur and Chascaël.
The new Feldshire-Cosher facility will replace the existing FAP, which was built in 1918 and has long since exhausted its resources, and its facilities do not meet the health and hygiene requirements.
The new facility will be opened in the near future.
The murder of a four-month-old child in an undisclosed state of New York will be brought before the court
The household of Chuvashi appears on the scene of suspects who are involved in the murder of their own child.
A criminal case against 31-year-old Novocheboksarska, charged with the death of carelessness has been investigated in Chebeksar.
The result was that on 26 July this year, the accused, together with his four-month son, came to celebrate the birth of his son's cousin in Cheboxor.
After a long silence, the new cat decided to stay in the guest room and let the child sleep.
When the little girl went out and cried at night, a woman who was not able to sleep with her to nurse her breast, but she quickly disappeared.
In time, the woman fell asleep on her son, which led to his death.
The criminal case is reported by the press office of the S.A. S.C.R. for Chuvashii, sent to court.
The inflation came from vacation.
Do they feel that the growth of prices is getting worse?
As a result of the cross-border sanctions of the RF and West Bank, inflation in Russia will be accelerated and will not be expected by the authorities, convinced by the analysis of the WTB Capital.
According to experts, the effects of the anti-sanctions will lead to inflation in the first quarter of 2015, wrote CRC Daily.
According to the latest mini-economic development forecast, inflation is 6.5 to 7.5 per cent in 2014 and less than 6.5 per cent in the next year.
However, according to the Commersant newspaper, this week the MER must make “small but basic” corrections in macroeconomic forecast by 2017.
According to the publication, the government can lower inflation assessment by 2015 to eliminate the expected decline in population income.
It was estimated that food sanctions of the RFF were in force year-to-August 2015.
How could such high inflation be expected?
The current situation is a shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change," said the source of the newspaper in Minfin.
Economicists from the GDP Capital do not share expectations of the government's financial and economic block on inflation and predict price increases in 2014 at 8 per cent.
The main effect of the product bans will be shared with possible introduction into the RF regions of the sales tax (NSP) in 2015, convinced experts.
The inflation rate is 9 per cent due to February, after annual price increases have dropped by experts.
In fact, last week, Rostat introduced the first inflation results after the FF introduced "accuracy sanctions".
AIF.ru examined the experts and explained their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, head of the FC analysis department AForex:
Price growth has already been observed on the main segments of goods.
Moreover, when social products were being used, the Government had to launch measures to monitor price stability in order to prevent the risks of undue price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and dealers are already reporting on a daily basis before the regulators, so that authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason, initiate price increases.
The key factors in the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the carbon flow rate, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian megaregulator, internal conversion due to the refugees in foreign currency, as well as the embargo on imports of food products from countries associated with sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressure remained under control, the value of the minimum product collection would not exceed 12 per cent for just one quarter.
The prohibition on the import of food products caused the shock of the proposal on the internal market and led to a completely logical increase in the final value.
Since we are unable to fully implement the import mechanism at the current stage, as well as to increase the self-sufficientness of the Russian market through domestic production, the sanctions will continue to pose a risk to inflation.
In addition to the physical reasons for the lack of confidence in national currency, as well as the deteriorating prospects of economic growth, inflation may well exceed 8 per cent by the end of the year.
Alexander Rawaev, Director of the Alpari Analysis Department
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30 per cent per month, and in zero it was also above the current level, another case that was then offset by rapid economic growth.
I think inflation is 8-8.5 per cent over the year.
Plato Maguta, Managing Director of the Fund of Maguta
The external factor related to sanctions against Russia is still being successfully halted, but if further pressure is to be lifted, especially in the financial sector, it can lead to some difficulties and increase the inflation expectations of the population, which are usually in the purchases of sufficient currency, in order to safeguard their reserves.
It can be assumed that the Government, the CBF and the Ministry of Finance are trying to mitigate the plutonium depletion, both by market methods and by government regulation.
But the price growth starts traditionally after spring and may become more sensitive.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia is 7.5 per cent, most recently, as the FF still has financial savings.
Farming centres benefit from a reduction in the number of households
Such a fall, resulting in an exceptional reduction in the number of households under 35 years of age, could lead to the loss of ten million pounds per year when young consumers today reach “the primary age of farming”, according to the HTA study reported by Financial Times.
According to this report, residents spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that owners of their own households spend on farming.
It refers to an increase in the number of people living in high-urbaned areas without crops, the popularity of house-to-house heating and reduced garden sizes as other factors that pose a threat to industry, an annual sales volume estimated to amount to £5 billion.
In Great London, where the number of households fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, Britain’s lowest rate of domestic trade is the lowest.
HTA and the Royal Farming Society reported that renting housing and the absence of garden space did not mean that people could not grow crops.
Guy Barter, Chief Agriculture Adviser to the RHS, said: "The growth of plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular for contractors who can transport plants with them when they travel".
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as "the golden century" of the various trade in agricultural products as a result of the increase in the number of households and economic growth from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve in this year due to better weather after adverse conditions in March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria has made a massive cleanup to the Land Fund
Three of the four Chiefs of the Landing Fund were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the Landbed Foundation were replaced on Friday.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria only informed of the removal of the post of Executive Director Atanas Dobreva.
His place was Lozana Vasileva.
Two of the three executive directors of the Fund were said to have been replaced on Friday.
The Deputy Executive Director, Tatyana Angelova, who has been responsible for public assistance and the SAPARD programme so far, reports BGNES with a reference to the “Trud” newspaper.
I did not attend the board of directors because under the law we were not members of the governing body, but I was later informed that I was released.
I can't tell you why my release is not reported on the fund's website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope I know more on Monday," said the English edition.

Turkey calls on the American Diplomat to report on spying
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey has raised the highest level of American diplomacy in the country to explain the report on American and British spying in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bullent reported that the United States confidential in cases and Turkish officials discussed the communication on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept reported that documents provided by the former National Security Agency analysis by Edward Snoudden show that Turkey was a priority research object for American and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Taiyip Erdogan reminded the importance of the communication, saying that all leading countries were spying on each other.
Earlier, the information reported that the main intelligence agency of Germany had also made Ankara an intelligence object called for a more aggressive response to the Turkish Government.
The largest Chinese companies were united against Alibaba
Chinese companies, among which are China's largest business innovators, Dalian Wanda Group and online giant Tencent Holdings (sects, senders, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search) establish a company that will compete on the online market with Alibaba.
However, it will be easy to imagine the wonders of the Chinese Internet that have left behind even their American opponents, eBay and Amazon.com.
Largest Union
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($814 million), 70 per cent of which will be owned by Wanda and 15 per cent by each of the online companies, according to the Wanda Group.
The company's planning to register is in Hong Kong.
The SP will combine the search services of Baidu with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest harvest in China, with around 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to the network of 40 Feschenbel hotels, the Wanda Group manages as a minimum of 49 commercial real estate facilities throughout China and 40 trading centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more $8 billion) in the construction of a cinema and thematic entertainment park in Cindao (a town in eastern China on the Iron Sea).
It is expected that the project will attract more than 1 million visitors annually and bring benefits to the level of $960 million.
In addition, Wanda belongs to the U.S. AMC Entertainment Holdings film network, which makes the company the world's largest film operator.
As of 2015, Wanda plans to equip all her shopping centres, clothing and entertainment facilities with e-commerce services, which are being developed as part of the Alibaba competition.
According to Dun Zee, which will lead a new company, with Wanda's merger, it will be possible to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million to 100 million in the next year.
The new platform must become the largest online-to-offline platform in the world, notes Don Cé.
The content of online-to-offline (O2O) is involved in attracting buyers to the Internet to come to ordinary offline stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is services for the sale of coupons of the type Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the largest "perog" in online commerce," said manager Wanda Van Cyanjlinn.
"The present O2O area in China does not exist now, and in this situation, the chances are almost all equal," he believes.
The Chinese Internet Trade Market is the largest in the world, and, according to McKinsey & Co., it will increase more than three times by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users increased to 632 million, resulting in Bloomberg's official statistics: it is more than any country of the world except India.
And it is estimated that by 2015 this figure could grow to 850 million people.
The Union of the Richest
The head of Tencent Ma Huaten has been China's richest man recently, but according to the Bloomberg millionaires, the founder of Alibaba Jack Ma has already paid him $5.5 billion.
The status of Jack Ma is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion comes to his share in Alibaba.
Head of Baidu Robin Li is now taking the third place among the richest people of China, while Van Cyanjlin, of Wanda, is the fourth row of ratings.
"It is very interesting to observe this battle: three of the richest people are working together to face even more rich challenges," said Bloomberg, director of the Chinese Centre for Electronic Commerce Research at Hanchjoo Cao Lay.
But he believes that the new company will hardly be able to compete fully with Alibaba immediately after the creation of "Rome can't be built in one day".
The fact that Alibaba is not only opposed by new companies but also by the world's leaders of trade, shows the pressure to report on the financial indicators of Alibaba for the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as a bit medium between eBay and Amazon.com, but since June, the Chinese company has worked more than both of its American competitors together.
The net profit of Alibaba over a period of almost two times exceeds the similar aggregate rate of competitors - it increased almost three times a year and amounted to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has great potential for money generation, thanks to its mobile applications," Bloomberg commented, an analysis from the Hong Kong Arete Research Service.
According to Alibaba's updated survey on the United States Commission's Web site, the number of active mobile users of the company in July was 188 million, significantly higher than the March index (163 million people).
At the same time, 32.8 per cent of all Aliba's transactions in the past quarter came to mobile devices.
Alibaba should refer to the value of its shares before IPO.
According to the average assessment of 11 analyses requested by Bloomberg, the company can be estimated at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to the Bloomberg sources, the debate on the Alibaba at the New York Foundation Board (NYSE) may be held on 16 September.
Road-show companies prior to this event will start on 3 September.
It is expected that Alibaba's exit to IPO will be recorded in the history of NYSE and will allow companies to attract about $20 billion.
In the meantime, a record of United States exchanges of funds belonged to the Visa payment system, which in 2008 had originally established its shares, amounting to $17.9 billion.
At least half of food items in the trading networks should be Russian production, the Lord's Members consider.
They have drawn up a bill on this subject.
This is about making changes to page 8 of the FC " On the basis of the State Trade Regulation in the FM and the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, must be at least 50 per cent of domestic product in stores in each type of goods.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, such as fruits and fruits of the winter, so they will be made to avoid possible discounts for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law is amended in the Tax Code of the RDF, which lays down a 10 per cent reduction in the rate of NDS in the implementation of all food products originating in Russia, reports the newspaper " Information".
On 27 August, a draft law was introduced in the lower House of Parliament to amend the GEF on various markets, which proposes that farmers be re-born in Russia, where small producers should be able to implement their products.
The Chief of Police of Magalupa has been charged with corruption
The complainants presented evidence of the police and police officers of the municipality of Kalvi in the State Prosecutor's Office of Malocha on Friday.
Calvii police officer on the island of Malorca was arrested as a result of charges of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in a scandal known as the Magaluf prison centre.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was detained on charges of corruption against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballen, the street where most of the ships and night clubs of Magaluf were located.
According to the daily online release of Mallorca Diario, the petitioners presented evidence of police and municipal officials from the city of Calvia at the Malorki v. Anti-Corruption Office on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the National Guard of Spain in connection with charges of corruption and will be questioned by the judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that the late owner of night clubs said that protectionism by the authorities had a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about surviving," one businessman told the court.
We cannot endanger our sources of existence.
We're losing something.
Magaluf fell into the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British breathing officer who was killing 24 men during a bar break.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to stop the indistinguishment among the rest of Magalupa, with the minimum number of well-known alcoholics on the bar.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where an incident occurred with the mine, was forced to close annually while the Playhouse and the Carnage Bar Escape organizers were extradited to €55,000 ($73000).
The Magaluf tourist resort, mainly popular among young Britons, was also a place of many unfortunate experiences in the state of alcohol abuse, known as "balconing", when people were brought from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel base.
The first day is marked by cold and winding conditions affecting flights to Adelaide Airport
WESNA prepared a cold surprise for South Australia, bringing rain showers and strong winds that had an impact on the airport of Adelaide.
Another 5 mm rain fell on the city at 9:00 a.m., after 6:6 mm, which fell in the night of the resurrection.
The last rain led to a pair of short-distance lightnings with a broken wind, including a hail, which started shortly before 8:00 p.m. and picked about 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After the winter released the early spring season last week, the temperature fell again on Monday to a maximum of 15.8C in the city.
The sculpted conditions were supposed to have served as one of the reasons for the delay in the landing of the Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane had to be landed on the map immediately after 7:30 a.m., but it fell into the wind speed zone -- sudden change of speed or the direction of the wind in a short distance -- and it was forced to rise.
Air pollution reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time.
These flights showed that the plane had to be raised during the second landing, and the plane finally landed at about 8:40 a.m.
The delay in the journey has led to the subsequent delay of several other routes, including the Emirates route from Dubai and the Kantas route from Sydney.
The maximum 16C is predicted in Adelaide on Tuesday with the probability of one or two lemons.
The calculation of construction projects in the RFF will take place again
Price change, construction regulation, and networking issues are under special control by the Federal Anti-Ethnopolic Service.
The FAS has established an expert competition council in the construction area.
At its meeting, the Head of Control of the CCS, Construction and Natural Resources, FAS Vadim Solovjev stated that “the current calculation of construction objects is absolutely improbable”.
The normative base makes price formation undisclosed and may lead to an unreasonably price of construction, which is considered to be in the FAS.
It is also suggested that the cost of building property at the design stage be determined on the basis of the market prices of constructive solutions rather than today's accounting standards and uniform estimates for technological operations.
These proposals are presented in the road map and are now being considered in the Ministry.
" The replacement of traditional accounting documentation in building structural elements should lead to less corruption in the industry, "WAG" explained Vadim Solov.
It is now estimated that each ball and arrow is counted, and it is not always possible to verify everything, so sometimes in documentation, poor construction companies can bury the whole tractor.
The Minister with the FAS agreed.
“The first cost-sharing work on structural elements has already been developed: cost-to-value methodologies have been developed for constructive decisions, estimates on these indicators,” said the head of the department of urban activities and architecture of Minister Elena Jukova.
As a pilot, the road construction area is selected.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As told by RGB, head of the Profi-Invest construction company Anatoly Demyanco, the estimated standards have been old-fashioned, but another business mechanism has not yet been proposed.
“As regards the proposed structural elements, this is difficult to implement in practice, as buildings are often used in a completely different manner,” he believes.
It's not secret that the striker is developing in a lot of ways.
In the view of the President of the Government of the NP “Expert Community of Professional Petitions” Ekaterina Leisina, the State is now the most affordable contractor.
The Deputy Director for Engineering of Rosatom Vladimir Malahov's capital construction centre has pointed out that today the market is subject to distribution to companies with contract portfolios, and to companies with monopolical competences and not allowing competitors in this field.
It considers that the creation of a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts is limited to the maximum effect.
The Expert Council was invited to form a system of command so that the same performer would not have the right to receive more than 1 billion rubs or more than 1 billion rubs.
The Minister believes that this approach needs to be assessed from a business perspective as well as from the effectiveness of building management.
As Elena Jukova explained, it would be necessary to assign the employer to the role of the employer, which would increase the number of contractors and budgets on its content.
In doing so, contracting experts should have knowledge to assess the quality of the work performed by responsible organizations and their safety.
Often, in such a division, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the overall safety of the object.
In addition, this approach could result in the withdrawal of high-qualified buyers for non-interest in obtaining a State order for a limited amount of work and a small amount of contract.
The closing of the expert consultancy centre of the Institute of Procurement, Alexander Evstaschenkov, believes that the procurement procedure has now turned into a business game for the contractor.
An example was given: "A party should indicate "specific indicators" without the words "or equivalent", "to be", "to", "more", "mean", "alog", "or", "type", "a similar type", "not less", "more", "maybe", "maybe", "maybe", "before", "not earlier", "not earlier", "not later", etc.
Contractors thus often abuse their right to establish requirements for the application made by the organizations.
Another issue 44-FZ, in the view of Eustaschenko, was that it was necessary to assess the quality of the application through the "bumous" proposal of the participant.
In considering the request of the participant, it is possible to assess only the qualification of the contractor but not the quality of the work that has not yet been implemented, the expert believes.
The quality of the work can be assessed only when it is accepted.
The Expert Council was also invited to transfer the marginal income from the top to the bottom of the tunnels to eliminate intermediate contractors.
The President of the Expert Council, the Stats-secretary, FAS conciliator Andrey Carykovsky, considers that this should not be done, as is the responsibility of the gender-responsive.
And otherwise, as Arkady Reykin "Atté" has said, "Is there a claim for a prostitute?".
Israeli children return to school after war in the Gaza Strip
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories around the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after they had spent the summer in bomb shelters, when rockets and mines fell to their homes during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip were closed while the territory was restored after the war.
The beginning of school activities brought joy and relief to those who suffered from the missile attacks in southern Israel, but the results of the fighting remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, the children's garden staff of Paosh, where the rocket was fired, picked up the tracks from the wall and the children's beams before the arrival of the disciples.
"We're a little afraid, but we're looking forward to the future," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibuz Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to be brought back to a balanced life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shane Bart, said that the other day she started going to school "a little strange."
"It was a difficult time, and we didn't leave our homes at all," she said.
President Raven Rivelin visited a Cuban who was located near the Gaza border to express his support.
Prior to the end of the war last week, thousands of border residents, such as Saad, had not gone out on the street or left their homes, moved into safer areas far from the Gaza Strip to escape a missile and a minor fire.
Many of the inhabitants of Nahal Oz, located near the Gaza border, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mine.
The Ministry of Education reported that about half of the families had not returned.
Their children were sent to other schools at the time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanijayu visited the school in Sderote, a city on the border with Gaza, which had been severely affected by the Palestinian fire.
He said to his children, "We are doing everything we can to give you knowledge and security."
Israel and Hamas agreed to a lasting peace last Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement soon ended with war, but key issues remained pending, such as Hamas ' request for the removal of the Egyptian Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and maritime ports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to put up a weapon and bring back the bodies of two Israeli soldiers who have been killed in the war.
A new phase of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, including three fourths of which were peaceful citizens, and at least 494 children were evaluated by the Palestinian side and by the United Nations.
Israel contradicts these figures and claims that at least half of the victims were combatants; however, it did not provide substantial evidence supporting that claim.
The Israeli side lost 66 soldiers and six peaceful inhabitants, including one Thai worker.
In the course of the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza fighters fired 4591 rockets and mines on Israeli cities, especially in the south.
The Israeli army then carried out more than 5,000 air raids and other attacks.
As a result of Israeli attacks, thousands of homes were damaged and destroyed in the Gaza Strip, and it is estimated that 250,000 people were displaced in more than 100 schools that were converted into asylum.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters, and the fighting continued, the officers responsible for education stopped the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope that school will soon be opened so that we can complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children," said 13-year-old Muhammad Amara, who now lives in one of Gaza schools.
According to the popular criteria, the price for immortality has been shown to be the largest winter growth in seven years.
The real estate index RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic for housing prices in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 per cent in August, reporting RP data on Monday.
This growth has led to a total increase in June, July and August of 4.2 per cent, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than two above 12 months by August 2013, but the increase was not equally distributed across the country.
RP Data Tim Louless reported that Sydney and Melbourne are leading a double-level market.
RP Data figures show that the housing prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 per cent in the last year, while in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent.
The next market power was Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where average prices rose from five to six per cent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, where government costs were reduced by 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Laules said that now, when the season began, there would be an increase in the number of real estate items on sale over the next few months, which would be a "current test" for the market.
“In view of the current high rate of auctions, the overall high rate of sales and current conditions with a low percentage rate, housing prices are likely to rise in the next three months,” he said.
How People Live in the Old House of Uf
In the former house of gold industry and mountaineer Evdokima and his son Ivan Demidova on the street of October 57/1 (formerly the Great Kazakhstan) 18 rooms.
The 18th - century house of the building has not changed substantially since the time of its construction unless it is considered wind.
Foreigners are going here as they travel, and residents suffer more than they are happy to have the privilege of living in the old Ufim house, which was remembered by Colonel Alexander Suvorov.
The building date is incorrect, history indicates two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it is found that the building is not 300 years old.
The old door, always open the door, screeching the kitchen.
The doors in the room were close to each other, the walls were torn apart, and a street was seen in the light of the crowded sculptures.
It seems that everything is being honest.
And the locals say, "You don't think so."
Living in a 17th - century wooden house was very difficult, as told by Tatiana Lukayanov, resident of apartment No. 3.
The object is on the mountain floor, but the money is not given to it for ten years, but we feel the museum exhibits that the authorities have just forgotten.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still self-defense, but the foundation is broken.
Many people still go to the toilet on the street, and they spend a week in the public bathroom.
How can we be content under such circumstances?
The road goes directly below the windows, even the walk zone.
Tatana's taking a load off.
Now it's obvious that it was just a matter of hearing: there's a stream of cars in the windows.
Look, the glass is always stuck, we can't open the window, but we're used to noise.
A human being is accustomed to doing good and evil.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to his husband, his hands are gold.
Besides, we have two rooms, we live the second with our son.
In other families, conditions are much worse, and in the second phase, there are about half a meter high.
To contrast, Tatjana invites guests to visit a neighbor from the room No. 6 People of Old Age.
A pleasant guest woman with a cup of coffee offers a cup of coffee and has a hard drink to tell:
We have a single room, 14.5 m2 on four people, and we live with a man and a daughter with a grandson.
I've been here since I was born, and there's never been any other place of residence -- the people's eyes of the room: the antresols, two wild creatures of the letter "g"; one of them had a button with a notebook.
It's very close and slightly different from the usual domestic interest: just a beautiful, "historic" set.
But the flow flows regularly: the water management system is never going to work.
People talk about their apartment in a delicious and amazing way at the same time as the Italian house in the Roman ruins.
It is one very old and recent, daily and legendary:
The Flood took place about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then they made us a little kitchen in the kitchen and a toilet from the old hall.
We live as once in a place where Demid and his family live, where servants live on the second floor.
Our apartment isn't privatized, is it?
In the Uf's Inability Centre, there is no privatization of value.
All we get is a single room, we can't demand more.
Four months ago we were promised to leave, but no further promises were made.
I'm not used to complaining and I'm not going to.
In this room (room!) there was a whole dynasty: my grandmother, my mother, my father, my husband, and my daughter with my uncle.
It's been all this time.
For example, health - care centers ran through the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the flag, they're the metrics!
They say, the solution has been mixed up on eggs, so it's been so long.
The house will be built on the ground, thanks to the Damidus!
Perhaps that is why no one has been killed by a broken bone or by a broken bone.
Only the building just slowly dies on our eyes: the roofs and the empty house are burned, the fields have been destroyed several times, we have destroyed the cement, but it's all useless - the solution comes into the earth like in the refrigerator.
They're talking, too, under our room's secret las and go to the White River, which was made especially by the older men who lived here so that they could hide from danger, in case of something.
They've been chased.
The old man tells him how some story came to him, he was able to let him start in the living room.
Then he decided to give them shelter in exchange for his consent to the October issue.
People have rejected history:
Where are we four in the uniform?
And here's a little bit of hope that's going to add more space to the house.
We agree to exchange, we won't win any more.
In fact, the elderly family didn't win anything.
The biggest dream of the people is to plant them, and the 16-year-old girl gave a separate room.
It is a two - bedroom apartment instead of the most magnificent ruins in which two generations are now living.
A sympathical, miniatural girl Olesi Karsakov from the room No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, in two densely populated areas of the total area of 23 m2 called the rooms, her large family lives.
We're all seven men, two children.
See for yourself what conditions.
The stucaturka is washed with cosmos, as well as with fire frames, in the kitchen walls and in the bedrooms.
The water in the back of the year is only cold.
In the rooms of Uf's very old house, it can be believed that most of them were married to Lavrent's husband from the room No. 4.
They operate the most spacious rooms in the first phase.
You're right, places a lot!
The apartment is 75 square miles [3 sq km] long.
We live as once in the rooms where Suvorov remained on the legend during his stay in Ufé, says family head Aleksandr Dmitrievic Lavrentev.
It's so high, it's spacious.
One bad thing is, it's all around the corner, it's broken, it's broken, it's broken.
Neighbors must have told you already!
Most of the suffering we have with the fields: the wooden roofs have been lifted, the earth has literally fallen out of the foot.
I've got support, kid; there's nothing else in the room, and in the other room, we're walking like we're riding on horses, so shitty.
The house of the buyer, Evdokim Demidov, Alexander Dmitrievic, can best tell any tour guide.
The gold industry is like a family, talking about it with excitement.
In fact, the identity was immeasurable: the owner of the Kagin and Uzian holdings built a house, fired guns and chairs, held the Ural miners.
The descendants of shopping in front of them are proud, but they no longer want to live under one roof with history.
I've been living here as a child in the 1940s, says Alexander Dmitrievich.
At that time, wooden spaces were set up for carts, horses, and caravans, which were then destroyed.
In 1968, they wanted to take our home, but something broke...
The story is repeated in 2014: the new home has been re-examined.
We, as a team, have collected all the documents, pledged the necessary institutions, and the others have learned that the transfer to the apartment is to be transferred to 2015 or 2016.
There's something we don't believe in anymore.
Two years ago, Lavrentev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Pakistan to learn about the trial of the house.
The housekeepers didn't accept it.
They were sent from one table to another and then, as a smile, they issued a book with no signatures and printed: "The Ministry of Culture does not oppose housing".
I even had this feeling that our house was no longer in the area of the city, since it was under number 57, then it was 57 A, and now 57/1.
As if he had been shot in the '70s.
The Russian Planet has been referred to the leading information-analytical sector of the Department of Land Management of Uf of Vladimir Barabaš.
The house on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the housing distribution programme.
I can't take responsibility for the actions of officials in the 70s, but I know that there was a plan for the benefit of all old houses, despite historical importance.
Fortunately, this has not happened, but the decision of the modern authorities to restore all the old houses on the streets of the October Revolution, which represent architectural value, has been successful.
The inhabitants are soon planning to move to new quarters.
According to Barabash, the restoration of Dom Demidov would be by Italian specialists who participated in the reconstruction of the buildings in Venice.
There is now an architectural binary in Italy, and the Old Ufa project is presented there among others.
I hope that, by 2016, the entire old old old Gazan street will be restored, says the official.
The house will acquire a suitable type, corresponding to the one that was before, three centuries ago.
The house of Demidov will, most recently, become a museum open to all who wish.
It was also decided at the Government level to make a street on the day of departure.
In the wake, unfortunately, there will not be too much traffic in the city.
To expel people from the future museum, Vladimir Barabash promised in 2015.
In fact, they will hardly be satisfied. Their new apartments will be the same area as they are now.
It's just from another age.
A forest fire started in Primorje because of the danger.
The drought was the result of a forest fire in the Ohotonic Local Forestry Territory in the Primor region.
The number of forces and funds is being increased at the point of combustion.
According to the guidance of the CBSB, the Premier Air Force created on fire requires the attraction of the aviation force.
Vasili Medvedev, Deputy Air Force Chief:
Fire, which occurred in a difficult position, has been detected by a pilot observer from the aircraft of the An-2 aircraft at a level of 3 hectares.
They burn the wooden remains on an old fuel tank.
The territory and cortisone are more than 45 degrees, and the lack of suitable fire extinguishers creates significant difficulties in drying.
We need Mi-8 helicopters.
The delivery of the forces in command of Mi-2 helicopters and An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
Four parachutists were immediately excavated after the fire was detected at the site of the explosion.
The main task of experts is to fire and to prepare a platform for the delivery of additional fuel and fuel.
In the area of lunch in the village of Ohotonicia, 3 fire extinguishers were provided.
As soon as the helicopter is ready to land in the fire area, experts will be sent to the site of the site of the Homeland Administration.
Lenny Henry: My father never kissed me.
He never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born to a family of immigrants from Jamaica, in Dawley, Midlands, in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked at the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry repeats the comedy, Rudy's Red Plastics, which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and has grown from the radio 4 broadcast series.
Soundtrack--we've got rhymes and rhymes, and the melons are vital.
However, Henry had to be tested through some difficult memories of his childhood.
After his mother died there was a lot of treatment, and Henry often thought about his relationship with his father.
He was very unavailable.
You've never seen his face, you've just heard his voice saying, "Stop laughing.
Stay away from your sister.
Get out of here!
I want to see the crack.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were grown up when I was a child, walked in with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer cane, the beauty of the cricket.
I never talked to him like that.
He was such a cute guy in the corner who read the newspaper most of my life.
Henry recently discovered a lithium mastermind in Dadley, and although conditions were better than in his father’s day, he was able to look at what his life should have been.
Now there's a little bit better, but it's the dark, dim, deep labyrinths of the morning with flames of fire and smoke and dogs.
My father went into the bathroom and just lay there, and you heard how he slowly started singing about himself because he wanted to get rid of a lithium master.
When I came there, I realized that he had done it years and years to earn us food, and I appreciated it even more.
Nevertheless, Henry grew out of a child’s lack of parental love.
My father never woken up, never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom got really bad at the end of her life did we start to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, by Don Frank, allowed him to share the love he had not adopted as a child.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop bothering me!
Dad, I got 22!
With Don Frank.
Why don't I have friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still excellent friends with Frank, whom he was married for 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why don't you make me friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of those who killed her.
So when I was very, very well corrected and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to take radical measures.
Then I started a serious exercise with fitness, and I also had a regular diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very heavy.
And that's cute.
No one's dark.
The change of Henry's career trajectory may have been reflected in his noble, short-sighted fight.
From the time he received the recognition of his Otello criticisms, he was completely immersed in the theater.
She's been tracking the comedy mistake, and then August Wilson's election.
This work is different from the seats and comedians that have been an inalienable attribute of his busy professional life.
He started a career when he was 16 and worked at a factory.
Didy noticed how he paraded on the stage and wrote about him in "New People."
His career on television began in the mid-70s: "For a long time, I was the only blacksmith on television."
He learned to work.
Not only did I have to raise my eyes in the audience, I had to learn to be an effective footing machine between 1975 and 1985, as a star working on television, and that was very difficult.
Lenni in "New Persons" in 1975
As his manager had the right to the Black and White Display, I am facilitating the entertainment program in which people have been "blacking themselves", Henry found out what it has been doing for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I kind of want this never to happen to me, but I don't regret what I did.
Although it was strange, a worthy judge of the position, I worked in large fields and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was “the prized easy to enjoy in British television for years and years” was also “the Grotesque Parody for Black People”.
As a representative of the people who were also exposed to the culture of black people in Britain and succeeded, Henry worked in an alternative comedian project in the eighth century.
The first season of Shaw Lenny Henry was transpired in 1984, and in the nineties he was known as, among other things, chief chief Geret Black of the Comedian series "Shef!".
The advertising roles, documentary films, televisions and movies took place in the next ten years of his life, but after his BBC series in 2008, "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "What you're going to do next, Len, because it's a little bit like you're wasting time or getting late."
There was also a series of documentary broadcasts on Radio 4 called "What's Best in...?"
The first was about Shexpere.
I had this allergy in Shakespeare.
I can't tell you that I've learned so much at school, and I thought it was, in a lot, the white people of the middle class with their shoes and shoes down front.
So I was very scared of him.
All the interview we had for the transfer, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Danch, said, "You have to try.
Don't move it until you know what you're talking about.
Listen to some of those words, and you'll understand why we all love Shexpere so much.
Henry spent 20 drawings from the latest Otelo monologue for the documentary transmission, and he got it.
I felt like I could do it.
Anyway, my head has been fixed.
"In this case, this is a serious case, with regard to the matter seriously, learn your text, conduct a small study.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this song for months and months before we put it.
And she was successful.
It was said they were waiting for disasters, and it didn't happen.
We've started a comedy mistake soon.
I went to the National Theatre immediately, and I just couldn't believe it till the end.
It was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
A technical misunderstanding arose, and Henry felt instinctively that his case was to please the public.
"The voice inside me said, "You'll have to work 10 minutes while they make a computer."
Instead, the Assistant Director announced that the presentation would be repeated as soon as the problem was resolved.
I went out of the stage and something said to me, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my duty.
I can let someone else handle this.
"You're playing the song, stay in the role."
Henry at Zaborah in the daches theater.
It was hard to study the text for the "Selection".
Panika's good enough, she's strengthening the muscle.
She also took good care of her, so it was like a sign above that she said, "What do you have to do with it?"
He says it, of course, with a loud voice.
So I'll keep it.
I really love it.
I like to be in the reception room.
To be sure, Henry still has the idea of a comedy -- all our way through the storm of his honor, when he does it, he ends up riding.
I've just decided not to work in the stand, because this piece with a megnopause from the whole room of strangers, I think it's dangerous enough.
If you're always trying to do this, it can lead to a trap.
I sometimes work in the Direct Effire in Apollo, whenever I want, but mostly, I don't get the satisfaction I used to.
I'm asking if he ever got that tower stand.
The joy of sitting in the room with the director, who helps to give the form of the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think I ever want to give up.
Is that his new charge?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a nice party.
You're always telling a story, and here's a great place to do it.
I love history.
People like stories.
Kenya registers public officials to identify "invisible workers "
Kenya has begun a biometric registration of all public officials in an attempt to remove “unvisible workers” from the government's payment notice.
Staff members who are not registered within the next two weeks will no longer be paid shall be reported in the Government statement.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive payments after they leave the public service.
President Uhuru Kenya promised to reduce corruption in the public structures after it came to power in 2013.
The audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) per month was lost due to pay for “invisible workers” and other financial violations.
The Government suspects that payments continue to be made to the bank account, even after a person dies or leaves public service, reports BBC reporter Vanjam Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All public officials should be present within the next two weeks in the identification centres to ensure that their data will be collected through a biometric registration procedure is reported in a Government statement.
Anyone who does not do so without reason will be excluded from the payment notice.
“This procedure will significantly facilitate the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of public servants, and will also be used to clean up the payroll at both levels of the Government – hence the problem of “unforeseen workers”, said Ann Waiguru, Secretary of the Office of Planning and Structure of the Authority.
Ten Turkish police arrested for “contract” against the Government
All 33 police officers were detained in Turkey under suspicion of "a treaty against the Government", reporting to local intelligence agencies.
The police representatives did not comment immediately on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 senior officers, reported by Hurriet Daily News.
Some of them had participated in the anti-corruption investigation activities last December, including four government ministers.
In July a number of Turkish police were arrested for questioning the establishment of an organized criminal group and hearing the phone.
Turkish President Recep Taiyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) identified their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others who were in power by Islamic cliché Fethoullah Gulen.
Not all children have returned to school in Ukraine
The schools in most of Ukraine again opened their doors on Monday (September 1st) after the summer Canyon.
This day is traditionally a major event for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsen Yacenuk took his daughter to school.
There he told the waiters that not all schools had been reopened, but that he was doing everything possible to protect the country for future generations:
The first September ceremony was not held in every school.
There is no peace above every part of Ukraine.
We have to fight for peace.
All Ukraine, the one great Ukrainian nation front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastuhov, director of the school in Slavianska, where the daughter of Yaczenyuk was sent to speak Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will be given knowledge that will benefit them in their future.
On the first day of school, the students traditionally note that children are hoping for the roses, holding air scars in their hands, and giving flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Ron Fairhead BBC, she may have found such an intrepid leader she needs.
She's the leader of the world's banking business, the management of the media and the internal rounds of the Tori party.
In fact, she has her own experience of working on leadership posts.
Its career began in the global management consultancy firm Bain and Co and then continued in Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the world in Pearsons.
She was the manager of the Financial Times for seven years, moving away when a senior position in Pearson's head office took place with a male colleague who took a lower position.
They say her salary is about £1 million.
Her political ratings were also broken.
She recommended that David Cameron Lord Brown, former head of the PP, when he was trying to bring the private sector specialists to Whitehall: she became a consultant at the ministerial office.
Her husband's former adviser, Tori.
Earlier in May, I called the president of the stolen tea.
BBC is not only a large and complex organization in the heart of public life, but it has an internal paradox.
The Council has two orientations: inside as the top level of the management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but as the voice of public anxiety and anxiety when something goes wrong.
This is almost inconceivable, which requires full radical reform.
However, a new president would risk coming, disintegrating and destroying the institution as difficult as China's dynasties if he lost his job in this process.
It's a difficult decision.
This would not be so difficult, many people would be happy to see the BBC decline in size - after reviewing its powers, finances and status.
As competitors mix rounds and new technologies expose the challenges of old habits, inevitable licensing negotiations pose a particular danger to BBC.
For a modest amount of £145.50 per year, Britain has a share of the world’s largest media business.
BBC tells a good story: it states that the results of its work cover 96 per cent of households and each of them stands at 40 per cent a day.
Moreover, it is evident that the population of Beeb is growing: 53 per cent today supports it against 31 per cent 10 years ago.
The BBC review and use models have changed: I now get news headlines on the mobile phone and watch missing programs on the iPlayer.
But it remains very popular and encouraging.
He needs an encouraging president - I hope he found him.
Perry from Texas says the humiliating tweet was written by some side.
The tweet, confirmed by the governor of Texas, the Republic of Rica Perry, contained a disturbing image of the District Prosecutor of Democrats, who is in the centre of criminal prosecution for abuse of power.
Twit was later removed, followed by another one from Perry's account, in which the record was discarded.
It's just that a tweet was published from my account, which was written by someone on the side.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I picked it up," a later post reports.
Perry's assistants did not respond immediately to communications with a request to comment.
Although the records were loaded with the confirmed Perry account, it was not clear who was actually present in this leaflet.
The earlier tweet contained an infamous character to the prosecutor in the area of Travis Rosemary Lemberg, who recognized that he was responsible for leading an experiment in April 2013.
Perry prohibited the financing of her office when she refused to leave, which led to the trial of a major jury in Austin this month against Perry, which was a potential candidate for presidential elections in 2016.
Your signature says, "I don't always drive a car in the condition of an experiment, three times the acceptable level of alcohol in the blood, but when I do, I charge Governor Perry for what he tells me about it."
I'm the most drunk democracy in Texas.
Lemberg did not have an investigation with a large jury against Perry.
They were employed by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a judge-republicator.
Perry did not recognize himself as guilty and called for charges of political arrest.
His powerful legal team requested a judge who was in charge of the case to reject the accused act, stating that the law used to prosecute the governor who had performed his duties for the rest of Texas's history was against the Constitution.
Perry continued funding of $7.5 million from the state funds of the State Department of Public Control, which is based in the Travis area and is persecuted in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to leave.
The wind caused a formal complaint by the left-hand control group.
Lent of Perry's confirmed account is frequently updated - and sometimes it is marked.
When he came to the fifth party meeting in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, Perry responded to the message that he could get out of the game, posted a tweet with a photo of himself running from the lake, and said, "You and us, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to normal state.
One of London's most famous contractors warned that the real estate market in South-East England had "returned" to the normal level of activity.
The house in the capital was the subject of a demanding demand and a highly rising price, with a wide range of fears that the credit gap would cause Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Piggley, the founder and president of the elite construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "From the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to the normal level of transactions from the 2013 peak", adding that it has provided a "sustainable working environment".
London’s real estate market has succeeded in falling, as foreign buyers have fallen into the capital.
Prices in the city increased by 18.5 per cent in just one year, according to the Land Case, by an average of 6.7 per cent in England and Wales in total.
The average market prices for the private, accessible and student schemes in Berkeley rose about one fifth last year, reaching £423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the fund in recent months has made London less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also continued to introduce new insolvency taxes and political rhetoric around the potential “special tax” before the general elections in May.
In the past week, Foxtons warned that the April reform of the mortgage market, which introduced more harsh conditions for lending, would also lead to a decline in market growth, both in sales and in the second half of the year.
Fresh data from the Bank of England showed a fall in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, assuming further cooling on the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, reduced its forecast of rising prices for London’s real estate in 2015 to 3 per cent on the basis that the real estate situation has already begun to deteriorate.
The transaction amounts then fell to four times over the previous year in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfer and Kensington, according to the WA Ellis agency.
Nevertheless, the demand for a house in the capital was very good for Berkeley, raising sales of more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Piggley added: "The demand for the goods needed with a good design and a better location remained early and, in the light of this, sales continued for a time."
In June, the company reported that it sold 3742 new houses this year by the end of April, almost three times as much as in the 2007 docrisis peak.
The annual income to pay taxes rose by 40 per cent from the previous year to £380 million, income by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
Speaking on Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr. Pigli reported that the expected revenue in Berkeley for this year would be consistent with the current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, income is expected for a year before tax payments are paid at £450 million.
The value of the shares in Berkeley was £23.96 on the second half of the day in London.
Photo by Jennifer Laurences published on the Internet hacker
Jennifer Lawrence is attending the 85th anniversary of the American Film Academy's annual prize.
Photographs of the film film by Jennifer Lawrence, who received Oscar's award, were posted online by hacker, which confirms that it has a "directory" of another 100 source stars.
The star "Gold Games" representative confirmed that Laurence's photographs are present and condemned the hacker for "hard entry into private space".
Law enforcement has been conducted, and they will persecute anyone who publishes stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
Photos that were significantly posted on the 4chan photo exchange site are likely to have been obtained through the lack of Apple iCloud online storage system, and the alleged "catalogue" of the victims of the injury includes the names of women's weddings, including Ryan, Kim Cardassian, Mary Elizabeth Winsted and Mary Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It is unclear how many of these photos are true, even though the stars of Scott Pilgrim against everyone, Winsted in Twitter also condemned the damage.
"Those who look at the photos we've made with the husband a few years ago, when they come home - I hope you're proud of yourself," wrote Winston on Twitter.
However, Victoria Jastys from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victoria-victor" confirmed that on the photos she wrote on Twitter: "These are so-called photos of me FALISHI, people.
Let me put it back in the womb.
Buzzfeed reported last night that the representative of the Pop-Star Aryan Grande had discovered that the photo on which she was likely to be real.
The exclusive rejection of Howard Jacobson's new novel on love and letter "J", inspired by criticism
They were divorced, and the best they could say is that they slowly broke up like a cardboard box that they left under the rain.
She just once told him that he was too serious, too heavy in the community, pressed, closed, and perhaps a little shocking.
And then she took his hand.
He saw in himself a nuisance.
He was like a rabbit, yeah.
The last victim of this pregnancy was a small romance from which he longed more than usual to be rescued from loneliness and a life of misery and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomonz was a trifle of beautiful hair cutlery and heartbreaking from the northern island of the island, more distant and more serious than Port Robin.
She came to the south with her older sister, Kevern, whom she considered her aunt, the last one to inherit a house in the grave, but it looked like a paradise of the valley under the happy name "Ray Valley".
No one lived in the house for years.
The windmills, in the vans, without moving the spiders, left their tracks on all windows, convinced that the house belonged to them; the garden of roses, similar to giant shells.
It was like a catechism from the childhood book, which, at the same time, was frightening and wonderful, with a whole dark garden.
See author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is included in the long list of Bucharest Awards in 2014.
The short list will be announced next week
Kevern and Eileen's chairs, holding hands, in broken chairs in the middle of the tall grass, enjoyed an unexpected warm night; both of them were deeply involved in the shower console, which provided the country with soothing music and refreshing news, when he looked at her baptized Korean feet, he recalled an old song of a long forgotten black man who loved to hear his father’s voice and threw his tears into the house.
You have too many feet.
Because of their aggressiveness, songs of this type on consoles were no longer played.
They were not forbidden, nor were they forbidden anything, but they were not allowed to keep away from them.
They've helped to become archaeologists, just like the word "archical."
Social tastes have done what would never have been achieved by orders and regulations, and among the books, people have chosen the memories of the rich who grew up in poverty, the colonial books and the love novels, from all the music they chose.
On that day, Kevern agreed to play in an imaginary Fortwig and a rough chemical voice to sing the great legs of Eileen.
Eileen didn't understand.
"It was a popular jazz piano song called Fets Waller," he said to her, mechanically attaching two fingers to the loss.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before she gets off his loss.
It started with the game they played when he was a kid.
His father played in it with his father, as he told him.
Start the word with "J," forget to put two fingers on it, and it's gonna be your pen.
It wasn't a very happy game then, and it wasn't very happy right now.
He knew they were waiting for him, here and there.
He had to explain that this is a joke.
Eileen never heard of him.
Jazz didn't play either, even though he wasn't banned.
The improvisation came out of fashion.
There's only one place left in life if.
When the baby started, people wanted to know exactly where it was going to end.
It's exactly the same with the island.
His unpredictability has been a factor in people's nerves.
And Jaz was an island that was expressed with the help of music.
Although he was 10 years old, he never heard of Sammy Davis Mladsham, Kevin knew about Jaze from his dad's half-circuit CD collection.
But he shouldn't have told Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
In view of her age, she almost forgot the time when the popular poets were not black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
The community was obedient, and this meant that each of its segments agreed with gratitude - thanks to those who had been protected by the trial - with the principle of group predictability.
People of African-Carobian origins, in terms of temperature and physical characteristics, were well suited to the area of entertainment and sport - and they were drunk and fled.
The departures from Indonesia, as if from the nature of the talent in everything about electronics, have been taken to ensure that no family remains without a working telephone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was scientific work; what was left of Greek was clay.
The exits from the Persian Gulf and Lebanon, whose grandfathers did not become determined to leave the country when what had been done, Essly, was still afraid that they would be accused of burning the flame, fearfully saying that the flame would devour the next, opened the restaurant with the weak and the Chaldeans, would not rise and sink.
Every man with his abilities.
Just as she had heard only ballasts before, Eileen was hard to understand how disturbing words that had just fallen on Kevin could have been on music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really sad," said Kevin.
Except maybe for people with big legs.
My father never hurt anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but a run-in garden gave him an allusion to safety.
Not one word could detect the sound of giant letters that looked like a cassava.
Eileen didn't understand everything at all.
How could your father love this?
He wanted to say it was crazy, but he didn't want to take two fingers back with him.
She already thought he was weird.
"It was said to be funny," he said instead.
She was unbelievably raising her head, closing the Kever's review.
There was nothing in the whole world except the dust of her black hair.
Nothing he'd like to see.
"Well, if you say so," she said, remaining with her opinion.
But that doesn't explain why you're eating it to me.
It was said she was really upset.
Do I have too many feet?
He looked at them again.
I can't say no.
The boaters, maybe...
And you say you hate me because my boats are too thin?
Do I hate you?
Of course, I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too early.
"I like you because you have a lot of boats," he tried to say instead.
I've got this kind of aversion.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
His attempts to hunt often led him into a life of misery, for he, like his father, had failed to receive a comforting promise that could alleviate the evils that flowed through the runaways.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe, and he, Kevin, a hotel.
Despite the good eyes.
Elin Solomonz grew up and got up from the palace, broke the console and poured the wine they drank.
The wine from the pool, so the experiment could not serve as a justification.
In her walnut, she was said to be as sweet as palm leaves in the Urgan.
"And I like you because you have a stupid head," she said...
Even if you don't like it.
He was sorry for her and for the extreme shame of her words, and for the fear she felt when she gave him an answer.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about living in the cold north archipelago where she grew up, but he didn't doubt that she was basically like the future.
The same huge ice - skating ocean had broken down on both of them.
The same men who suffered so much, even more sensitive and sensitive after what they had done, would have been killed if their ancestors, rivals and destroyers were thrown into the fire in the light of the pope, ready to lay their hands on any woman who laughed at them or ridiculed them.
Do you have a haircut?
If she had not been careful, they would have shown her the hole.
The beginning of sex is now the most common expression of erotic disintegration between men and women; the opposition from the press ballads that the consular had issued began to kiss and then hit.
More clarification, Kevern's opinion, because the kiss was already a guillotine.
Elin Solomon's corps showed that he had to go.
He was raised from the chair like an old man.
She felt the heavy burden of guilt herself, but his anger surprised her.
It was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She saw him walking, and from the top of the window she saw him walking, her satellite -- a man who called himself heavy.
Adam, who left the garden, thought it.
She felt deep compassion for him and for the men, even though some of them even put their hands on her.
A man who turned his back on her, with a broken back, crushed, crushed, all his ability to fight left him - why did she say she knew it so well if she could not remember any case until today when she saw it?
Once again, one of Eileen Solomons looked at his feet.
Twenty years before the events described above or around Esme Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked at Offana, an informal community-based monitoring service, prepared a small report on the low and medium-level level of violence in the most parts of the country, where it was expected to be reduced if not all were to be stopped, taking into account the resources and forces that had been allocated to its elimination.
“Many have been done, and much is done,” she wrote, “to mitigate the vicious aggression of the people who fought in thousands of wars and won most of them, especially among these sympathies and narrow settlements, where, despite the wars of the church, the gentle spirit of human kindness was rarely felt throughout history.
Some qualities, however, appear to be inconceivable.
The higher the ladder, the lower the strands he's born.
The population is sensitizing over sensitivities, swallowing stories of obstacles and declaring its belief in the welfare of marriage and family life, but not only is old poverty keeping its grip on both rural and urban communities, but there is also evidence that new and ill health is born at home, on the workplace, on the streets and even on the playgrounds.
"You have a boring habit of writing too much," said her science director, reading the whole report.
I think you should read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum let his head down.
I should also ask you: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think we have to answer," replied Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme has renewed her right to private life and silence.
A feminist?
It's a resounding silence.
"I'm asking," finally said Luther Rabinovic, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We don't have a clue here.
We are the servants of society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitive, absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy, can sometimes tell the results, like what you showed me.
Obviously, you are warned against the church, and what you call evil and grave, others would interpret as an expression of natural greed and energy.
To continue to offer TOM what has gone on, if it has been, as if it had happened yesterday, means to lose the country of life it needed.
Esme Nussbaum looked at the sides while Rabinovic spoke.
For his head roses, such as the flame, the celebratory letters have repeated the advice Ofnau gave to the country for the last four centuries or more.
Look at your neighbor, your wife's prices, listen to the ball, go to the music, talk on the phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
A word is better than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied quietly when she confirmed that her science director had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything except that we haven't treated as effectively as we believe.
I'm worried that if we're not ready, we'll find out that we're repeating the mistakes that have led to Tom what I've done, if we're going to make it.
Only this time will we let go of our anger and distrust of others.
Luther Rabinovic united the ends of his fingers in the pyramid.
This gesture must have meant endless tolerance.
"You're going too far," he said, "calling "the mistakes" of actions that have or have not been done by our ancestors.
You're going too far and when you talk about what they threw out their anger and disbelief on others.
In your place, a person should not need to remember that, in the past, it is a protection right now, we are not talking about "we" and "they".
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of unrest, here and there, and everything we know.
"For whom, if he is honest with himself, he dares to stand up to Esma, "not a part of the society can be well justified.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it's bad or good - whatever it's done, it's done.
It was then.
We don't have to say anything else - we agree here.
And how you don't have to blame anyone, you don't have to justify it if it was appropriate or if something could be right.
But why did it happen if it wasn't for learning?
It's a past existence to forget it.
If I can add one word to that--
The pyramid of Luther Rabinovica is broken.
"I'll look into your report," he said, leaving her.
The next day, on the way to work, she got hit by a motorcyclist who went out on a tractor, as described earlier, "in bad light."
The collapses are happening.
Army Lesoto claims that the revolution has not been planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The representatives of the Lésoto Army examined the fact that they were preparing for a coup in order to persuade the Government, stating that they were acting against the police, who were suspected of trying to arms political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, stating that the country's army had surrounded its official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family into a neighboring South Africa, declaring that he had been threatened with attempted suicide.
The representative of the army, Major Ntelle Ntoi, said that there was no conversion in fact, but that the army was responding to the threat of "political fanatics", which the police were trying to armed.
"What has happened this morning is that the command of the Armed Forces of Lesotho has taken action by receiving several explosive reports that among the police, there are some elements that are actually planning to arm some political, young fans of political parties who have been ready to set up chaos," he said.
The representative of the Government of South Africa, Clayson Mongel, said that the actions of the army looked like a turning point.
"Although no one has made claims for the arrest of the authorities, it is clear that the actions of the armed forces of Lesotho currently have major signs of conversion," he said.
The representatives of the Lésoto Army reported that the soldiers returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital was quiet.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motejoa Metsing managed the Government without Taban.
Tabana stated that he believed that attacks on the attempt to combat corruption in the country would be carried out.
The situation in Lesotho was very tense since June when Tabane stopped parliamentary sessions as a result of differences in her Government.
He stated that his actions did not undermine the Government, despite the charges in return.
Deputy Chelsea Marko van Ginkel will be conducting the next season at the right rent in Milan, reports Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutch will come to Italy in the near future to conduct a medical examination.
In the last season, he went out to field in the London club only three times.
We remember that Milan had previously purchased the Liverpull attacker Fernando Torres.
Production in the euro area was shown in the lowest 13 months
The growth in production in the euro area was slowed down to the lowest rate in August, according to the popular study.
The latest value of the business activity index (PMI) of the Eurozone industry by Markit fell to note 50.7 in August, with a decrease of 51.8 in July.
More than 50 points to growth.
New orders were suspended, and businesses were affected by increasing tension between the EU and Russia with regard to Ukraine.
Values reached the European Central Bank (ECB) assembly on Thursday.
Markets will be expected from the bank of a clear plan on how to cope with the stopover of the euro area, as well as the threat of inflation in inflation, which amounts to 0.3 per cent.
It is suggested that ECB leader Mario Dragi could give further signals later this week that he was thinking of a scale of quantifying for the euro area, similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although some growth is better than any growth, the corrosive effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers will become more evident," said economist Rob Dobson.
The PMI of the German manufacturing sector, the largest Russian trade partner in the EU, fell to the lowest in 11 months of note 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second large block economy, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to experience this concern, as well as the slowdown in Italy from stable growth to stagnation.
Noting that the momentum for growth in the main industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also does not add credibility," said Mr. Dobson.
The slowdown of industry is likely to bring oil into the fire to analysts waiting for additional monetary or fiscal incentives.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI grew to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, lead economist IHS Global Insight, said: "It is best to say that the August index of business activity of the eurozone industry is still growing."
He added: "The producers of the eurozone are obviously living very hard at the moment, as the current growing geopolitical pressure - especially related to Russia/Ukraine - adds uncertainty in many countries to the difficult conditions.
This increased pressure is evident to have hits on business, particularly on consumer confidence, and it is likely that some orders are being held or even cancelled, particularly major orders.
He said that "more like that," that the ECB would eventually have to carry out a variety of quantitative blends, "though we suspect it would be limited."
The inhabitants of Mariupol are exposed to live bullies
In Mariupol before last week everything was quiet - no one was going to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Asian Sea, and it was working.
Now the people are looking forward to the arrival of the officers.
According to politicians, the separatists are moving to Mariupol to move to the Asian Sea - recently taken by Novosovsk, which has not yet joined the self-evident republics.
The Mariupols decided that the Ukrainian army would, although it would protect them, had a little power against the very armed representatives of the DDR-LNR and had been helped by the military.
They grow roofs, build blocks and strengthen them.
On Saturday evening, a few thousand people came to the eastern border of the city, and they stood there in a living cave, slamming Ukraine.
They are going to do the same in case of arrival.
Volunteers collect and transport supplies, collect medicines, print the newspaper.
In the city, stores are gradually closed, and banks and banks are shut down.
Ten years for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years from the cold school, like children who have been in it, they are still suffering
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken to prisons by Chechnya Boys in school in Beslan, southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of whom were killed during this three-day test, which had damaged the world.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who lied about death at school.
About ten years after the terrible arrest of the Brazilian school, 334 people, including 186 children, had been warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics arrested and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of the fourth quarter, this was said to be something of the worst possible harm.
The tragedy united the east and the west in a turning point, which then miraculously grew into action and hope for the future under the harsh conditions of the storm.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to southern Russia to find some of the victims who had been deceived by death at school.
We have found wonderful young people who have endured poverty, even though memories of terrorist attacks will live with them forever.
They're the biggest hope?
What a war that is now threatening Ukraine, where children like them die, is now ending.
A girl trying to take a picture back to the shooting room
She was impressed by a well-known Russian photographer, Dmitri Belakov, when she tried to get back to the shooting room after the mine was fired.
Aida was desperately looking for her mother, Larissa, now 40.
There was fear that they both died, but in fact they survived.
"The woman told me to run away from all the forces, but I couldn't," said Aida.
My legs were covered with blood.
I got up and used to go back inside to find my mother.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After the surgery ended, she thought she had completely recovered, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago the pain came back.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
A few differences remained in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist, to help people the way doctors helped her.
"That tragedy changed my life, but she didn't, of course, hurt her," she says with a challenge.
"It happened to me, and I can't change this fact.
Once a year, I always want to be in this sports room to remember all the others there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it the other day.
It's too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my only-class, was killed there.
We played together when we were young, and we thought we'd go to school together.
"I don't want to leave my husband until I finish school and I don't start working.
I'm thinking about the family then.
She says that capture stays with her, even though memories get a little confused every year.
I am glad that many people in the world will still remember our hardships, and we are so grateful for the help we received from people from Britain and from all over the world.
When I see it on the Internet, where I'm lying in a school window, I think that many people will see it for the first time, know about our tragedy and do so that it doesn't happen again.
A boy who ran through the city of the pool, thinking his mother was dead.
It was his first day at school (the growth began in school at 7 years of age) and he spent three days in detention, covering his mother Tamara.
Then there were seven of them, and he said, “My mother told me to take care of me, if I have to, and hold her by the hand.”
After one of the explosions, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Get out of here."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and saw a crying boy on the road, grabbed the child by his hand, and ran through the city.
His father, Vladimir, who got his son married, said, "Damir told me his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was released and was in the hospital with her leg wounds, thinking that her son had died.
Then she said, "I cried out with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran away and locked me up.
Damira was later brought to London (now the current newspaper News of the World), where he was rewarded as a Child Protection Officer from the Fund, Mr. Tony Blair and his wife, Sherry.
"This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering him," he said yesterday.
Still, I can say that he's out of my mind.
I'll remember how soon after that, I took all my toys off.
But now I can play computer games with guns, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I'll remember the kids I played in the yard that didn't even choose.
We never say they're killed or dead.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the gambling store where I was allowed to choose everything I wanted and ride in a car with an open top.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine, where war leads to the mountain that he and his friends have survived.
This horror is coming back to you every day, but I'd like to be able to stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who worked volunteer work in a woman's monastery last week.
I want to help.
I want to serve in the police any time, and I hope that I will be enrolled in the school academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, said: "37 children have been killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine yourself?
I remember the cold silence right after the arrest, there were no children who would scream and run around, and that silence continued for months.
She will clearly remember her visit with Damir in London.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I understood how people on the other end of the earth can understand our feelings, can give support.
She was grateful to Sherry Blair and her fund for the prize and the opportunity to go to London in August 2004.
I'd like to call Sherry and just tell her that 10 years ago, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember how they called all the local Russian restaurants when Damir wanted to have a boat.
I remember how he played with the restaurant officials, Damir shot them out of his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And he spent the whole month after our nightmare then.
I was impressed that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I still think that this world has not been better for ten years.
Now there's war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think a lot of kids have been killed and will be killed.
It's just like our kids.
I think for many people war is a news report that they hear when they're upset or when they're busy.
I just know these people feel, they're afraid of it.
And I can't stop feeling him.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's sad.
Damir grew up to be a very soft and peaceful boy, not an aggressive or wicked man.
He's not looking for places, for example, he's not circling on this last nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six single-class people, and they've been going to the sports hall for a while and they've been burning candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember how he was lying on the couch, turning away from us for hours.
He didn't sleep. His eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw out all his weapons and other military toys, and he's now 17, he's taller than me, sympathetic, smart and healthy.
I find it hard to believe that for a few hours I was so convinced that he died and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to get rid of the explosion and stood on my feet, I looked, I saw around me when parts of the body were lying all around.
I was absolutely convinced that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hole.
"I remember calling him "Damir, run, run," but still I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he listened and kept his promise.
That is how life continues for us, unlike so many others.
Georgie Ilin, 17 years old
A boy who shocked after the arrest became a victim of a tragedy in Beslan
Room: survivors of Beslan Georgie Ilin with his mother Fatimo after her arrest in 2004, and Georgia's case today
His covert face was a picture of fear when he escaped death when Chechen terrorists shot him alone.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of war in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, was the chief doctor, taking him to school on the first day of school before bringing his older son Vladimira to university.
"I went two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy stayed alone for three days at a time," she recalled.
Not just one, there were family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgie was able to survive.
The closer we get to that date, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
Not a day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days all the time in front of me.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
Falling into the soul: The photograph of Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking shots of the attack and was everlasting in the sculpture (right)
I remember that Georgie wanted to go to school the day she said she wanted to meet the teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of Georgia crying in San Marino.
Georgie doesn't like to look at this photo, and she's in the bookshop in our house.
I understand, but I also think that this photo makes people from all over the world feel our pain.
Georgie now says, "It's important that this never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and never know the truth.
Now they're investigating this breach of Boing in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what she was called?
This world is going to be something very bad.
"I can't understand how this happens because if you ask people, no one wants war, how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing for that pain.
We need ten years to forget her a little.
She influenced my health, and I still feel it.
About three or four years ago, I had nightmares because of the capture, but now it's getting better.
I went back to school later in 2004, and I was terrified every day.
I thought about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going to this sports hall before every 1 September.
I want to give the date to remember my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget about it, but I'm not trying to complain about myself.
My life is going on.
I finished school this year and went to the medical university in Vladikavkay.
I'll learn to become a cartoonist.
My first choice was to go to the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgie Farniev, 20 years old
A boy who survived despite what was on the killer's leg
It's amazing: Georgie Farniev was in the killer's leg at the time of arrest, but he was able to survive.
During the arrest, he was photographed in a sports hall sitting next to a bomb in a terrorist killer's leg.
Actually, it's a miracle he wasn't killed.
"It seems to us that it was yesterday," says Georgie, who wanted to learn from the FBI intelligence officer, but was unable because of the damage that had caused his health at the time of arrest.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that children are easy to deal with bad things, I have to say it's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005, for the next year, I was the first and last time I went to this sports hall again.
I lost consciousness.
I'd never go there again, and please don't ask me to show me where I was sitting on this famous photograph.
Survivor: Georgie Farniev today with a photo on his laptop in the hospital after the arrest
My pain is great, and I wear it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like thinking about it or discussing it, and they never asked me about school.
As for the physical condition, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with the horse that was injured, but now I want to be normal.
But my health did not allow me to go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical conclusions, and they replied that it was impossible.
My second appointment was with animals, so I went to the veterinary institution.
I spent two years there.
He learns to treat all animals from cat to dog.
He said, "I know I will never tell my children about my experiences.
That's not what children should know about, and of course not what they should survive.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary is near.
I'll go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to mark her.
I know Georgie won't come.
She's got to be stronger for him because he was there, but I'm not.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn't help.
I'm so grateful to God that he came back to me.
He's staying with us.
Georgie's grown up, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something is so terrible wrong with you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He had several operations, he could go, but he can't do sports.
I'd say he's over 50%, but it's impossible to go through and forget that.
This warm experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the arrest, and that only makes my pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and those who were my ways.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could have given me, but my heart is hurt for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I also know widows who never married again.
It's hard to believe that life is going on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart shook me out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what is happening in the world -- wars in different regions.
Why are these people fighting?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country right now, and I have a hard time believing it.
We were a friendly country in the past, how did we get what we're fighting now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure a lot of children have been killed in Ukraine and will be killed.
If all rebels could be caught and thrown away as far as possible.
Aliona Ccaeva, 10 years old
A youth who has been lured into a safe place for the fighter of specialty
Saved: Alion Tkaevu is in a safe place for a Russian Specialist (left).
Now she's ten (right), and she doesn't remember a great crime.
In the world, there was a spirit in 2004 when little Alion was taken out of the school in Beslan by the Russian police.
Terrorists abandoned her, but violently left her mother, a teenager sister, Christine and Brother Mahara in the gym.
Mahar, who was then three years old, survived, but Alonina's mother and sister died in a fatal battle.
Her father, Ruslan, had recently remarried, and with his new wife, Lightman, had a little daughter he called Christian in his memory of the daughter he had lost.
Alion, now ten, has nothing to remember about capture and growing into a smart and healthy girl, is talking to neighbors.
"They're the greatest happy family now, and Alion and Maher are both beautiful children," said one close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is observed.
You can understand why.
Lieutenant Sindzi Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United, to Dortmund, Burundi, noted that he was impatiently waiting for him to return to the field as a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a happy event in the career.
Of course, I'm very glad I'm going to play for the Borusia again - it's a picture of the word Kagav.
I feel very good.
Half of the positive emotions and with no patience, when I can go to the field again in the form of "Borusia".
Remember, Kagawa moved to ME from Bosnia in 2012 to 16 million euros.
However, he was unable to build up an English club for two weeks, for a total of 38 matches in England's champion, and he killed 6 cats and delivered 8 results.
A man accused of visiting a girl on the walkway "Pleikan" in Faife
An 78-year-old man will appear before the court for a three-year-old girl on the walkway “Pleikan” in Faife.
Gordon Stewart probably got a girl to move to Pettenvin in East New York.
The prosecutors said that Mr. Stewart had taken his Audi Q3 without due care and paid attention to the girl, resulting in her trauma.
Stuart, 78, from Antwerp, denied his guilt in the Sheriff's Court of Dandy.
Sheriff Charles McNyer, Royal Lawyer, appointed the date of the trial in January.
Obama, Merkel and Olland are not divorced in Vladivostok
The Duty Free Airport has issued a table prohibiting the purchase of a number of world political leaders in this store.
Don't open them with spirits, water and horses.
The Department of Stores concluded that President Barak Obama, FRG Chancellor Angel Merkel, President France Olland, Vitaly Klicko, Julia Timoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan and several other prominent partners could not open their store.
And she brought the appropriate table to the door.
Previously, Obama had been prohibited from appearing in a less accessible form to him in the Service of the Dietary Boards of the IGU, as reported by the General Bureau website.
Whether the American President ever had a dream to ask at a digital table in Russia, it is unknown, but the authors of the ban are clearly saying that they themselves are awfully cruel.
Is there a secret after the Embargo: Medvedev gave advice to the agrarians
The Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, believes that new technologies should be developed in the context of the embargo on Russian agronomists in order to adjust the emissions of oil-producing products.
The Council was on the day of the visit of the Yupticeprom company to the Agrocomplex.
The head of the Government also advised the restaurants to refocus on the Russian meat, the quality of which is at the right level.
The annual food embargo was introduced in Russia on 7 August.
The main trainer in Russia, Valentin Maslakov, is satisfied with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the expert, the third is a good result, given the lack of targeted training for interviews.
Our athletes have spoken at their level, bringing you to the game of Moscow.
Thirdly, the confirmation of our sufficiently high command level.
It is good to see that the advantage of the French and even the Americans is minimal.
It should be borne in mind that we were not prepared for these meetings.
The season is over, and we have not forced our leaders to participate in the DecaNation match.
In recent years we have been the second in this tournament, but in this season we have renewed the congregation.
The French, on the other hand, set out an impeccable team of 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which was announced on a number of occasions by the public.
But even such a composition of the conquerors could not stand against the Americans.
I therefore believe that growth has been made in such a representative company at a good level.
But in some ways the results were lower than the same Brilliant League.
The season is over.
Of course, sportsmen are no longer the most important result, even more at the top of the command level.
The main place was here.
And as a result, it was agreed, when men were so engaged in tactical escape hypnotism that they showed the results below the average level... of women's escapes.
4 guidance on improving the quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to photograph or film a video under the water, you have a number of options for the device.
The most expensive option is the water-pronged mill, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120, or extra camera, for example GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I made these photos on the family holiday using several cameras, all at a price of about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, a number of rules need to be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera battery and other offices are completely closed.
Also, set up your camera for that type of photo or video you'll take.
There are some photos and video cameras, which optimise the exposure to dark underwater conditions.
And before you get into the water, find out how deep your equipment can relax.
Some cameras are estimated at 5 feet, others at 50 or 60 feet.
See our guide for the buyer and ratings of digital cameras, both for traditional and waterproof models.
Take a few characters, because many of them are not.
There's a CD device that will help you make photos when you don't normally have X-rays.
Even if you have JCD, it will be difficult to look under the water, and the frame composition will be an accidental process.
So do a few people.
Also, if you have a serial casing mode that captures several individuals with a little different exposure settings, use them.
Stay on the surface.
The amount of light is significantly lower than the depth of the water.
If possible, stay in the surface when you film in a pool, river or ocean.
It will also allow you to pass more colors on photos; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Swim closer to the stems.
It is excellent advice for drying, but it is even more important under water because of the dark conditions of the world.
Especially important if you take a camera: This device is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you need to get close to the edge objects if you want to fill the frame.
The 2012 Olympic Games Bronze Prize for the Free Battle of Bilal Mahov can go to the Greek-Roman War.
This was reported by the chief trainer of the Dagestan collection for the free fight of Sazid Sajid.
A specialist did not exclude the participation of a sportsman at the World Championships in Tashkent in September 2014.
Bill Mahov is currently on the team of classics - the word "R-Sport" of Sajida Sagidov.
In fact, Bill spoke in both ways about young people.
He became the winner of the tournament of liberals and the third prize in the Greek-Roman alliances in 2005 and decided to focus on the fight against free will.
A long time ago we had discussions that a new stage of our career would take place in the Greek-Roman struggle.
I'm going to say more: Mahov can speak at the peace campaign in Tashkent if he wins a suit.
But the decisive word always for the coach headquarters in the head with Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was such a man whose personality strength could face everything, even in a giant organization, such as the National Health Service.
The consultant, an anesthesiologist, has dedicated his career to eradicating both disease and disease.
Among those who approached him were his wife, an officer of MI-6, who had to live with devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson understood that while doctors are involved in diagnosis and disease, those who are treated mostly worry about something completely different are pain.
On one occasion in 2007, however, he became a victim.
"I didn't feel like usual," he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find strength in myself.
He found out that he's suddenly interrupting his wife, Juliet.
"I want it to happen faster, not later," he said.
When Juliet went to work for a week, Lawson discovered that he was unusual and unusual why he was upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked his colleague to make a breast X-ray.
Two weeks earlier, he was riding on the beds in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray came.
It was a mesotelium, an untreated cancer that affects the lungs or the eyelids.
For most cancers, it is difficult to explain exactly why.
Although some smokers suffer from mild cancer, for example, not all of them have cancer.
But with the middle room second.
Almost all of this is a contact with an austere, woody building material, which was sometimes called a miracle, but which is now known as a deadly threat.
For most of us, mesotelium is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbesty, at the end of the day, is a material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when the recommended industrial ban has entered into force.
Even when he was used, only individuals from the specific industries worked closely with him, such as turboizonizers, builders, shipbuilders, and dock workers.
The industrial toxin from another era is hardly a cause for concern today.
But that's wrong.
Britain seems to be on the brink of the mesotellium epidemic today.
There's more people dying from mesotellium than anywhere else on the planet.
At the rate of death each year, some 2,500 people die more than twice as a result of car accidents.
Annual number of deaths from mesotellium since 1980 and projected future deaths in Britain
The reason why we feel its deadly effects now is that although the use of asyxes has been illegal for many years (all types of asymptotes were finally prohibited by the law in 1999) the development of mesotelomas has been a matter of ten years.
And the attack of mesotelium is not limited by the vets of industrial construction.
Asbesto was, and in many cases it remains in the house where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we learn, and the stores where we go shopping.
As a result, the mesotelium does not pay attention to class, level of attendance, profession or age.
The boroughs of elections, from the fashion London universes to private schools, did not save.
Parliament's building is shattered by selfishness.
Even hospitals that are designed to treat us have been the reservoirs of this deadly cancer.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a truboisolist.
I mean, he had to think about where he could get in touch with the person.
Then he'd match.
"It seems that there may have been a lot of stress in the tunnels in the Gaia hospital where I spent six years at a train station," he wrote.
All the students, nurses, doctors, and freighters were using these tunnels.
Interestingly, how many of my patients are affected by the same disease?
It was a question on which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
"Of the four doctors who were in the Gaia hospital and who later developed mesotelomas for the last five years," he noted in the 2010 letter, "I was one of the survivors."
How many of us are affected by this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesotelium when he was 48 years old.
When he died on 17 February of this year, he was 55.
It's been such a long time.
Fifty percent of patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
She's always dead.
So now we can only repeat the question of Luzon: "How many of us are suffering from the same disease?"
According to Professor Juliano Pito, the leading expert on mesoteloma in Britain, it is most likely that between 1970 and 2050, when the epidemic in Great Britain had to survive, about 90,000 people would die.
Most people don't think they're going to die like this.
Astrologer in Quebec, Canada Alamy
The sixth review of records from the court hall, where victims are often treated for compensation, shows how far the attack on mesotelium has spread.
In June, for example, Marks & Spencer acknowledged that, despite the lack of consideration, Janice Ellen had been contacted by the owner.
She worked in the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, leading the clothing offices on two facilities, one of which was the headquarters of Oxford Street.
Miss Ellen was 18 when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children under 20 years of age.
"Until this happened," she says, "I've never heard of the interstellar, I barely knew about the body.
I couldn't even come in my head that would bother me.
A few people really know much about themselves.
I mean, abstinence is not a single substance, but a group of six minerals.
They received their name from the word "asbestyform", which means a wave structure that informs them of the quantity and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used for construction.
Crystal, well - known as the white abet, is much more often met in buildings today.
It was used in the blood panels, the outer plate, the thermalization of the tube, the wheels, and even the brakes of the cars.
He is dead less than other forms of assailant, but still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization “a serious health risk” that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, is the corrosive acid (mozitis) and the deep acid (crokidolite).
Britain was once the largest Korean importer in the world, and experts suggest that “there are strong, although consistent grounds to believe that this is the main reason for the extremely high number of patients with mesothellium [in Great Britain]”.
Staff member Marks & Spencer has been influenced by Assassin at Oxford Street, London Alamy
Jennis Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mezoteloma, but Juliana Pito's work makes it possible to assume that her story is far from ordinary.
He studied patients, which suggested that “a significant percentage of the mesothel when there is no known effect on work or home, was most affected by the environmental impact”.
Most of this effect, he says, is due to “normal use and impact of weather” on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which addressed the Westminster Court, shows how people, even in the very center of the Government, could have an unknown impact.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical shocks and noises at parliamentary committees had been infected by an abetting, which died from a fatal accident, such as “strong air currents”.
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems to be true.
Although the Directive on Technical Services of Parliament insisted that the Westminster Court had received "a clear health certificate", it now recognized that it was necessary to do business at £1 billion on Parliament's reconstruction, to improve electricity and remove stress, and that after the 2015 general elections, members of Parliament may attend the QE2 conference immediately, rather than in the green layers of Westminster.
The report of Goddard noted that “the situation with the asset was not governed by different rules”.
It is impossible to know if this mismanagement will be a living thing.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who failed to find their own personal contact was Graham Abbott, a doctor of general practice.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50 years old, he suspects that he was affected when he worked in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital that successfully submitted asylum claims," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places where he worked and the dates.
What he will clearly remember was that day in early December 2009, when he was hit by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of surgery last night.
Suddenly I started to lose weight.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't walk all the way home.
As a doctor, Ebbott knew that pain was coming from the lungs, the clothes around easy.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect a medium.
Eventually, he couldn't go to work for a month.
Doctors have made X-rays of the breast cell, and have pleural cataracts to remove fluid from the lungs and send it to the analysis.
Still, his condition remained undiagnosed.
Gradually, his health improved, and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after he had been involved in sports and heavy drinking.
In 2011, one of Ebbotta's patients came to him with similar symptoms, and later he was diagnosed with "mesotelium".
Even then, however, Ebbott did not have this to do with his own case.
In the end, his patient was ten years older and worked with a self-employed person.
The connection was clear in this case.
In September 2011, Ebbott's condition worsened again, and his doctor advised him to show his results to the ICT and X-rays of a group of specialists.
In December 2011, at least two years after Ebbott began to feel bad, a smoker, equipped with a camera, was inserted into the area between the face of his chest cell and the eye of his easily.
I'm an optimist.
I'm usually just going further," he says.
I haven't had too much time on this, I'm telling you.
But Rachel, my wife, survived.
The result of the biopsy came for a week between Birth and New Year: "I was told that it was mesothelium."
Gram Abbott: Diagnosis
Soon Ebbott was attending a meeting with nurse Macmillan, one of whom suggested that he be contacted by a lawyer.
That's when he realized the extent of the epidemic.
“It has been shown that abetting has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, where there has been a lot of exposure to noise,” he says.
People who have suffered from the effects of asthma in these buildings are now suffering from this disease.
Thus, mesotelium is now affecting younger people with unusual professions.
The most dangerous isolated tumors in the hospitals were in the basements, so it is unlikely that patients would suffer.
But many of the staff who were passing through the tunnels to escape from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or to eat in both tables (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost totally exposed to the toxic substance.
In a few decades after the war, it has been said that hospitals were a place where, theoretically, lives were saved for patients, but a place that posed a threat to the lives of doctors who treated them.
He's still getting away today.
Schoolers set up their fires in Bunzena at Assassins
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbet was often used in offices, shops, libraries and museums because of its amazing insulation and fire-fighting characteristics.
School too.
Of course, many, almost at first, were affected by the influence of the asthma in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in numerous chemical studies, the schoolers set their fires in Bunzen on the ashtrays.
Web sites focusing on the problem of asylum in schools have appeared.
At that time, in our homes, such harmless things as a full plate or sardines, usually contained accompaniment.
"It is the industrial core, which is placed in a large number of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lausson in the case against the Gaia hospital.
In one case, the only contact that could be remembered by a sick woman was the drought of the 1970s.
Be careful, therefore, to sow seed in your field.
The effect of diagnosis when it is known that disease does not cure is enormous.
"It takes a lot of time to realize it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I tried surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I had to go and talk to myself.
Well, I won't meet Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the condition of the patient to the condition of the patient.
As an uncountable number of patients before him, he will recall how much information had to be taken.
"It was hard to know everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
They gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I don't see Christmas anymore.
Here's everything."
Mezotelium is especially dangerous, as is the mechanism for how we support life, - the only act of breathing - is the cancer that kills.
Most of the cases of mesotelomas are caused by personal contact.
The asbesty is made of tiny particles.
When an abet is destroyed and the lungs are absorbed, they can be stopped in the lungs, the eyelids are light.
The wings of the sky reflect the cloud and can cause the mutations of the cells.
“The problem is due to the breathing of the yellowed ash,” Professor Tom Treger, a cardiovascular surgeon who arrived in the Gaia hospital in 2001.
That's the hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected that he had an assailant impact, now, on the irony of the trial, the Mesotelium Treatment Center.
The investigator knew of the situation and treated some others who were likely affected by the hospital.
When the stars fall into the dark of the light, Treger says, "the spirit pours them out on the periphery where the clouds are.
It's actually an invasive process from the very beginning.
The usual options for treating other forms of cancer are much less effective with mesotellium.
The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, causes heated disputes.
It seems to some that this should be tried.
The trigger is not agreed.
"It's impossible to make the blossom," he says.
It's impossible to fit around with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer is "not very well exposed to chemotherapy", which "acts" but does not cure.
"There's been a long-term disease," says Treger.
But in the end, they're all dying.
Fortunately, some patients live well, much longer than expected.
Writer Steven J. Guld died 20 years after he was diagnosed.
Two and a half years after diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he had been ill with mesothellium, Ebbott met Andrew Lausson, who, four years after the diagnosis, had become the only support and advice office for the same patients.
"Hello, the Central Central," he said alive when they called.
"He was very positive," says Ebbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very strong.
In the beginning, Ebbott proposed six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months and extend his life to a whole month.
"I was in despair," he says.
I wanted to get married.
Lauson, however, "he's been trying to give everyone a little more positive dress."
In a meeting with several specialists, Ebbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loiko Lang-Lazdonski, professor of tetracological surgery at the Gaia Hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need direction, I just called them, and they accepted me," admits Graham.
The medium-statist patient should receive direction and funding approval.
Money plays a crucial role for patients with mesothelologists to get better treatment.
However, when such treatment is finally ineffective, many patients are faced with another financial cause for concern - about the future families they leave behind.
And then they go to court for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of the Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known that obesity has been a health hazard since 1898," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it became understandable that even a very small number could pose a health risk.
That's when they talked about the mistrust of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital finally settled the case, but it was not "the full-value solution", according to Morgan, since Lauson could not prove in detail that his mesoteloma was the result of contact with the patient's personality in the Gaya hospital.
After investigating his death, the representative of Gaia's hospital confirmed, however, that “the stress in both of the places on which the word was spoken was removed in the 1990s”.
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Selfishness
Of course, contact with a company or place of work, usually ten years later, has been a major problem for patients with a meso-cell needing compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed or closed.
Fearful archives could have been lost.
And those who are protected from hunger know that their time is not yet over.
In response this year, serious new legislative acts were introduced, which would help the patient with the interstellar recovery process, even if their former employers were unable to follow.
Under this law, a £350 million fund funded by the insurance industry was established for those who were diagnosed after July 2012 and who could prove contact but who would not be judged.
In such cases, patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court would be able to award in the ordinary case of compensation, about £120000.
About 300 successful applications are expected every year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with mesophones, believes that £350 million is a "very good job" for the insurance industry.
“This transaction, written by insurance policyholders,” he said, pointing out that the amount is a fourth of what insurance policy would have to be paid if it had not been included in the interim and patients with the broker could have been able to track the company and search the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Pension, admitted that the law was "not perfect".
However, Penning and Morgan recognize that, with seven people dying every day, there was a need for urgent action.
"People suffer so much, and they need help today," said Penning during the second reading of Bill of Mesotelium in December last year.
By that time, Graham Abbott was in the hands of Professor Loika Lange-Lazdonski for 19 months.
Following initial consultations, Lang Lazdonski recommended surgical intervention, which, unlike Tom Treger, was considered effective.
This led to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a treatment in which Lang-Lasdonski could be praised by 40 per cent of the survivors in five years.
Ebbot had a sense of power.
"It's, of course, one of the most important things," says Ebbott.
You see it in patients all the time.
There's some force that supports you.
When you give up, the situation can get worse.
Graham Abbott was in operation in March 2012.
By the end of August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
The following scans did not show any signs of disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
It was a couple of five [arms] in my chest cell.
I had to fulfill 50 times.
It's not life-threatening.
It's the end of life.
And again, Ebbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no trace of panic.
However, this process was both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think about practical things -- about finance when I die, for example, or about what a woman needs to show her how the timer works.
When you get bad news, you become unhappy.
We need to look ahead.
Like Ellie's father, 16 years old, and Tamsin, 14 years old, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It's hard to understand what to say and how much to say.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that means I wouldn't survive until I was old.
They reacted very differently.
Tuxin is very social and energetic.
She told all her friends, and they called us very quickly.
Ellie was more restrictive.
She didn't talk much.
Such bees are something that must be dealt with with with by all the sick cancers.
However, such discussions are not equal to hope, even the challenge of living.
This disease (even as in the end, for Steven J. Gulda) is a dark definition.
As Andrew Morgan says, "mezotelium doesn't pose a threat to life.
The bodies of the oppressed Pharaohs are trapped in the dark tents.

No compensation is paid.

China refuses to grant Hong Kong the right to elect leaders; protestors swear to refuse
The Chinese Parliament decided on Wednesday not to allow Hong Kong voters to apply for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands for democratic reform.
Such a move will, in most cases, start with long-standing protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began planning and mobilisation in the hours following that statement.
In fact, the decision of the People ' s Assembly of the People ' s Assembly would allow communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not eligible for Beijing.
"It has not misled our expectations, but it still makes sense," said legislator Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
It's not what Beijing promised.
They lied to Hong Kong people.
And obviously we're dealing with the authoritarian regime.
In protecting China's decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the Assembly of Peoples of the People ' s Assembly, said that allowing the international movement in the election of Hong Kong leader would be too “haotic”.
Since 1997, when Britain has transferred control over Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the inhabitants of the region to vote in the head of the Government since 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the decision adopted in the wake as a democratic step forward, as it gave Hong Kongers the right to vote directly; however, it also made it clear that the Chinese leaders continued to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of the Committee on the Movement of Entrepreneured candidates from Beijing.
And, according to the new article, only candidates who "love and love Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision was taken after the summer when one of the largest and widely publicized protests in Hong Kong had been held for many years.
Most of the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers threatened to close the Hong Kong financial area if Beijing does not guarantee this universal electoral right.
On Wednesday evening, just a few hours after the statement, hundreds of Occupy Central parties met in front of Hong Kong ' s headquarters.
The organizers said that their movement was moving towards a new stage of civil unrest and that they would be held in the wave of protests in the coming weeks.
Nevertheless, they did not report details of their efforts to avoid problems with public authorities.
The organizers reported that the movement “was merely thinking about the possibility of capture of the central area as an exclusive measure, which could only be taken if all the possibilities of dialogue had been exhausted and had no other choice.
We are very sorry to announce that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and that the capture of the central area will undoubtedly take place.
State authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for the Beijing Declaration for several days, and security measures have been strengthened at the Government headquarters with police and barricade.
Many in Hong Kong feel that they are gradually losing control of their own city.
The flow of mother-to-mother residents enhances competition in the field of goods and services.
It is also reinforced by the fear that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the movement of the Occupy Central, saying that its demonstrations are at risk of business as a source of life in Hong Kong.
"The protocol they are talking about may lead to a major economic damage, depending on how many people will participate and how long," said Lawlor Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to be concerned about Hong Kong coming out of control.
This is an idea that is valuable for investment.
China's government media also provided reports in recent days, in which Hong Kong activists of democratic movements have been shown to be different from Western countries.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted 78,000 participants to more than one fifth of Hong Kong voters.
And in July tens of thousands attended one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
A U.S. Bachelor's Culture Towards University Life: First-class participants were invited to come on a private plane
We are happy to answer that question, starting the first luxury travel service in Britain for current students.
To leave a clear impression of coming to university, the company also offers transportation options such as a personal plane, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service was thinking of security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to take their goods across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
In conjunction with our new options for VIF, we look forward to helping students this year to get to university with minimum effort and maximum growth.
The representative of the company reported that, as the service was only launched, orders had not yet been made, but added that “the students will begin to order this service within the next few weeks”.
The company also stated that although students had to pay £9000 a year, she still hoped to find a market for this service.
Students today are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hope: it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF is what it takes.
Nevertheless, the National Union of Students criticized this service as being removed from reality.
Megan Dan, vice-president of the NSC on higher education, said: "This project is an incredible waste of the lives of most students.
Many students who start university this month face a life-threatening crisis when access to financial support in the form of loans and loans does not result in an increasing cost of basic needs, before they can even begin to think of spending thousands of pounds on something of a simple income in society.
Familiars raised the issue of racial identity and behaviour of the police after Ferguson
A armed youth was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
The next one will raise his hands, and he will cry out, "O Lord, do not shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, related to the murder of young Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noted a trend in Internet conversation among white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminists who left comments put gender above racial jurisdiction when it came to the promotion of reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as the tension in the Middle West grew and national attention was drawn, Peres saw the responses of white women, who concentrated 100 per cent on racial identity.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the murder of 9 August, personal bones with such titles as “Think of Ferguson from a woman’s white” and “Feninism – not only about the violence of women” appeared relatively late.
But for Peres, they showed a significant degree.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
This is very symbolic of the crisis we have faced, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so racially bound, they felt that they needed to be pointed out.
For a professor of English at the University of Ohio, Coritas Mitchell Ferguson has raised problems that black Americans face every day, but which are not understood as “women’s problems” in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and I'll get 150 les from here," says Mitchell.
When I write something about how colored people are being attacked in their own country, the silence sounds.
"Why are women safe to talk about relations in public but not public security?" she asked.
For black women, such as Mitchell, who have studied racial, gender and sex issues in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between racial issues and gender issues.
From her point of view, black women are in a position to clearly distinguish these problems; they are faced with complex realities every day.
While white women are now joining the issues of racial identity and gender in the feminist community, Angela Hetter, professor of female and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors have done the opposite.
“ Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were injured, and on the basis of this, the rape of white women has been almost always done,” Hetter said.
There was a need for a white woman to confirm a statement to justify a divorce.
From the point of view of Hetter, the gap between white and black women occurred when white spouses, for example, Susan B. Antony studied the situation at the end of the 1800s and saw that fighting for electoral rights would be effective only for one group: women or black people.
"They decided to put all eggs in the basket of the right to vote for women, and the right to vote for black people should have appeared later," Hetter said.
Looking back on such things gives us a clear indication of why women are not trusted by white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women to protect their husbands and children.
Even after the right of women to vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against kidnappings in the South Women's Association for the Prevention of Marriages.
This group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for assistance, Mitchell said.
From the point of view of Mitchell, in support of the reactions of white feminists to the problems faced by the situation in Ferguson, the conduct of the police, racial discrimination, reflects the time when white feminists had to "know" the problems that black women had faced in a number of generations.
"The truth would be great if activists with such [traditional feminist] ideology were as serious as the right of the child to be questioned as they are about the right to contraception?" Mitchell asked.
The second wave economists, who have taken up a career in the fight against reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now beginning to understand what this means.
A prominent feminist activist, Gloria Steinem, two weeks after Michael Brown's murder, used Facebook and published a rare article by Colonist Guardian Rebecca Carol, which required the white Americans to participate more in the protests on racism.
“I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the danger posed in the body – and points of view of racial problems that are significantly different in public surveys – will be in the head of change,” Stephen wrote.
Although Steinem has been given more surprising feminism, which includes itself and the problem of racial identity, and the gender, its comments on race in America still surprise some.
A study by the American Business Institute of Christina Summers, author of "Who stole feminism?" said She The People said that young men in the United States, especially young people, are “more vulnerable than their sisters", but the label Steinem on Ferguson contradicts the criticism she had previously expressed.
We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently launched a small program, “Watching My Brother” to help vulnerable black and Spanish youths, it was followed by angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
Police relations with the black community are not the only problem that is leading to the top line of traditional feminism.
After the United States border service arrested about 63,000 minors without furthering the country's south-west border this year, the immigration reform was once again on the surface - this time as a problem of women.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to address this issue as important to women, she had to share all the stories of immigrant women.
"They're talking about themselves," said Mercado.
When the overwhelming majority of labour visas are issued to [immigrants], women attending them are placed in positions that are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are a challenge to women's organizations," she said.
Ipswich's house "with pigs" is sold
The photo of the house on sale in Safffolk was taken away by real estate agents when it was shown to have a large pig resting in the hotel.
For sale of £120000, a separate house with one bedroom is on a private road in Ipswich.
A detailed description was made of a picture of a guest's home, where a pig with a head resting on the floor was painted.
The Connells Immigration Agency reported that the pig on the photo is the pet owner of the house.
"However, the photograph has been wrong and has already been removed," the company representative reported.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former congregation home as “a unique one house with one bedroom. ”
Although the agency has removed the photo from its website, it remains in advertising material.
The sale of the house attracted interest in social networks where some asked whether pigs were sold together with the house.
Russian tennisist Maria Sharapov, in the fourth round of the US Open, came into the picture by Caroline Voznjacki, feels that she does not have stability.
According to the sportswoman, she wishes to finish the year and try to get to a new level, moving from New York to OSIPOW.
How do you generally assess your results on the Big Shrem tournaments this year?
Of course, I'm glad you've won Rolan Garros.
As for the three other tournaments, I had little stability, especially at the end of some matas.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
She couldn't even get to the fourth floor.
What goals do you set for yourself until the end of the season?
After the defeat, I have a huge motivation to go to a new level.
I have more than enough to work, and I'm going to do my best to finish the year.
The Asian tournament series is already starting in a couple of weeks.
A member of the Gosduma Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth, former World Championship Nicolai Valuev proposed that GTO be paid bonus when it arrived at the wedding.
According to him, the rules will generally be the same as those of the time of the world - people will make rules about promotion, escape and other practices.
Remember, 12 Russian entities will start implementing the GTO standard from 1 September in their territory.
I also offered students who gave GTOs the bonus when they arrived in the woods - Valuev noted.
For example, they can add some balls to the EGE.
It is also proposed to provide additional output workers who have passed the sports tests.
A new millionaire appeared in Harvey City, South Wales, after winning the lottery
A game in Harvey's lottery this month.
The search is for a new millionaire on the south-west of Perth, where one happy person will pick up nearly $1.1 million from the lottery on Saturday evening.
The gas pipeline in Harvey brings gold in the main prize for the second time in five years, the previous prize was $1 million in November 2009.
However, a successful winner still needs to make a statement about himself.
The thief's owner Steve Forvard said that the prize brought food in a small town to the south-west of Perth.
The whole city is talking about it, and everything's very comfortable.
We thought this could be a secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia have won a major prize in the past month, noting the completion of several successful weeks for state players.
Last week a game from Kenning Weil became one of five million in August, after a huge $7.5 million prize from Belmont a few weeks ago.
The winning pair has been playing for 20 years and has reported that the prize has given them the opportunity to travel in peace and buy a new home.
A million from Harvey has won the main prize in Western Australia by 59 this year, with a total of $85 million.
Mini-economic development wants to accelerate the growth of the electricity market
This week, the Minéconomé will submit to the Government a comprehensive plan for the development of clean transport in Russia, told the Deputy Director of the Department of the Ministry of the Interior at the table held by the "Wedomists" at the Moscow Autosalam 2014.
The plan is designed by the Government, one of the main objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted by the end of September at the beginning of October, said the Officers, the proposed measures on electromobiles and hybrids - the development plan for vehicles on gas fuel in Russia already exists.
The plan (a copy is in the "Vedomostas") calculated in 2014-2017.
The assessment criteria for electric and hybrid transport should be developed and decided how to stimulate the use and production of clean vehicles.
The Government's report, which describes tax and customs support measures, will be prepared by December 2014; the credit and credit licensing scheme will appear by April 2015; and proposals to reduce car prices, stimulate location and create service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, Mr. is expected to make changes to the regulatory framework to facilitate the construction of the infrastructure (in parks, parking stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to formulate proposals for regional authorities during 2015 to also encourage the use of clean transport, in the form of benefits for transport and parking, for example; and proposals for the expansion of the purchases of such transport by February 2016.
Finally, by October 2014, the Minico-Development will include a list of indicators for assessing the activities of regional authorities that reflect the effectiveness of supporting the production of clean transport and the development of decent infrastructure.
The electricity market in Russia has been sold in 2013 to around 100 electric cars in the country.
At the beginning of 2014, an electronic import shipment was cancelled, and sales were estimated to be about 500 tons, predicting the Chief Executive Director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey Pankov.
However, the five-fold increase does not make much sense: 2.78 million light and light commercial cars were sold in Russia in 2013, according to the European Business Association.
Only Mitsubishi Motors is imported to Russia.
Renault, a company that is prepared to import, is directed primarily to corporate clients, says the Director for Strategic Planning and Partnerships of Renault in Reimm, Russia.
Most of the other electric transport producers, however, took a stand against Russia.
The development of electric cars is also in Russian producers - ", GAZa " "", but the release is miserable.
For example, in January-July 2014, ASM-Holding, AutoVAZ issued 30 electric cars.
A small demand for electric cars, recognized by the Director of AutoVAZa, by Sergei Amanov engineering, would not be able to break this segment without the owner's support.
The development of the Russian electricity market in addition to the road vehicles (e.g., sold in Russia, on average twice as much as internal combustion engines) inhibits the indistinct infrastructure (union units) and inspires the Autostate Director of Sergei Celikov.
Due to the road conditions and low rates of low self-sustainment, electricity will remain a lower segment of the Russian market in the next 3-4 years, the chief editor of the "Autorevian" Michael Pouzanaski, has agreed with him.
Autoproducers, on the contrary, say that some models of electric cars are already close to normal value.
In the Russian electricity market, there are good prospects, mainly to assure consumers that "electromobility" is real; in particular, it will contribute to the emergence of all new stations, stressing the president of the BMW Group in Wolfgang Schlime, Russia.
Such infrastructure projects, for example, are carried out by the Rosseti host: several stations are built in Moscow, and about 80 are soon to be established.
Negotiations on the construction of the network will also take place with other regions.
According to the director of the Rossetei department, Vladimira Sofia, the company believes in the electricity market and is ready to build loans across the country, but there is also a problem: a small number of electric cars in the country and a lack of a single standard for the hire of various brands.
In addition, Rosnets, as a network company, have no power to sell electricity, is being able to do so with respect to the hire of electric cars.
The Pancows consider the most effective way to support the formation of the electricity market in Russia.
The zero rate will be applied by the end of 2014, and the possibility of extending it is being extended, extending the profit list.
The replacement of transport taxes on the environment (the idea being discussed and related to all machines) also supports the market, but it is not as sensitive as customs preferences that Pankov believes.
The transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, in contrast with Norway, where the tax decline has resulted in a sharp increase in the sale of electromagnetic vehicles - 12 per cent of them are now on the market.
In Russia, there is also a need to encourage car owners such as a free parking park in the city centre (as they have already done in Moscow), believed in Pankov, or the possibility of moving electric cars to a given area, which is still not available in Russia.

Alexey's already seen a different picture.
His mother in Lugansk was killed, not by anyone, but by Ukrainian soldiers.
My friend called me, told me that there was a minute shot, that most of all these Ukrainian armed forces were told by one of the soldiers, Alexei.
Then I wanted to get out of the bathroom.
They didn't get us out of Ilovakia, they said we were on the boat.
I've already made a deal with the commander, and the report has already been written about the suit.

In Moscow's bureau, an increase of $35 to 37.15 was made to the base of geopolitical pressure.
The ETS markets started transactions at $37,11-37,2 rubs./$1, in an average two-minute course fixed at $37,16 rubs/$1, which is at 4 times above the previous closing level.

He continued his tenure and rubles and even updated the historical maximum to the dollar.
Investors have already been exposed to the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions for Russia.
However, as much as it looks like an art star, I'm disbanding through the media, especially the Western ones.
The options for introducing new sanctions to the FFR are not so many.
TeleTrade "The opening of the Moscow rubl continues to be a major weakening against the bivalve cors.

Twitter tried to become more interesting for new users
The Twitter microblogging service has changed the user registration process so that new participants are rapidly involved in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have lost their microbes.
Now, new Twitter users will look at a large number of recommended account services as soon as they register.
The recommendations are based on the interest registration.
Twitter automatically sets a flag on the signature for all automatically selected accounts.
For this reason, the user must take his own photographs so that he does not read those who are not interested in him.
If previously users of the microblogging service saw only the attackers of the recommended users, Twitter is now setting up an example of one of the popular blogger's tweets to help make a human impression.
This is the biggest change in the Twitter registration page in the last three years.
Recently, Twitter has been working actively on modernization of the service.
Such activity is primarily linked to continuing service efforts to achieve immortality.
In 2014, the microblogging service had slowed down the user base and the reader activity.
The company is currently desperately in need of a large number of local resources for consumers, which would last for a while.
Only so can a stable flow of advertising funds be ensured.
The Day of Knowledge in Moscow will be a delight and a delight.
During the entire day, the first September in the Moscow region will be cold and exciting, reporting meteorologists.

The vehicle maintenance programme has been resumed since 1 September
Since 1 September, Russia has resumed the road maintenance programme.
10 billion rubles will be allocated for these purposes by 31 December 2014.
As explained by the Chief of Min Promombtor of RF Dennis Manturov, the funds are earmarked from the thresholds already brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the RF through the transfer of support from other sources.
The programme covers all cars over the age of six years.
The amount of compensation will be from 40,000 for the light car to 350 000 for the cargo.
In Russia, such a programme has already been implemented earlier.
The main difference in the current project was explained by the Minister that it is now envisaged not only that the car will be stopped to receive a follow-up discount, but also that if the car is more than six years old, it will be possible to buy a new one at the age of three in the dealer.
More than 16 billion rubles have been lost in the previous Federal Tiliization Programme from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011.
Thanks to it, the level of production of light cars in 2010 was 1.2 million coal (up to 101.4% for 2009).
The Creator Comeing Out Simulator will issue a game of contemporary journalism
Gaming director Nicky Casey, known for the game Coming Out Simulator, decided to release the game on contemporary journalism.
He was talking about his project at Kill Screen.
Casey started to work on the game a few weeks ago, but the fact has become widely known only now.
The source of inspiration for the game was what happened in Ferguson, where protests are now taking place after the police killed an unarmed black youth.
In the focus of the project, which has not yet been mentioned, it will be the effect that the information on history has on their impact.
The hero of the game, a citizen journalist, will have to photograph what is happening in the areas where the police and the population are intertwined.
Hero can take a different picture of what's going on, which affects the course of events.
If he paints a scene so that the police will look like heroes and protestors, the police will start to treat him better and leave him where the ordinary person can't go.
If he's going to let things go wrong, his photos can turn peaceful protests into a mass rebellion.
The eyes in the game will need to be collected with the help of a hero's Twitter, where new subscribers will appear if the photos shown there are popular.
Game has no names yet.
The date of exit and the platform on which it will appear is unknown.
Casey, however, published an image showing how events can change depending on how a photograph was made and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen Casey, he explained that he had been thinking about the concept of this game for a long time, but he wanted to dedicate it not to the United States but to the Gaza Strip.
After he started collecting material for the game, he realized that he did not have enough knowledge and skills to shed light on the history of the region.
However, when he saw how the media lighted events in Ferguson, he decided to play on the motives of the event.
Nicky Kays is an independent developer who plays browser games.
His most famous project was the Comeing Out Simulator, which entered into 2014.
This game, which discusses events from Caesar's own biography, focuses on how a bisexual adolescent tries to talk about his or her relationship with gay parents.
Gelettes inject Ukraine into continued bleeding
The call to prepare for the regular ten thousand victims of Ukraine's Defence Minister Valerie Geltei has urged the people to continue the bloody resistance, as stated in the IDF Communication.
"In Moscow, of course, attention was drawn to the statement made by the head of the Ukrainian military department Valeria Geletea, who declared that "the completion of the East Ukraine liberation operation from terrorists" and the beginning of the "The Great War of Fatherhood", in which the losses will be calculated as "ten thousand".
The degree of adequacy of the head of the Ukrainian military agency, published on its website in Facebook, is a subject for research of non-military experts," the Russian diplomats reported.
They are working to believe that such statements may belong to the Ministry of Defence of the Civilized State.
On his Facebook page, the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday: “The Russian side has already threatened that they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us in the event of continued opposition.”
In that connection, he stated that the “Operation for the Liberation of eastern Ukraine” had been completed.

Tony Stewart suffered an accident and returned to the track
The return of Tony Stewart to the track has already ended a little more than in the middle of the Atlanta Motor Speedway race.
Stuart broke into the wall a second time after his right of the front row broke to 172 rounds, ending his statement.
Stuart brought his car to the garage and then went up without talking to the reporters.
His commander, Chad Johnson, said that 14 members of the team were upset, but now they are focusing on the race in the following exits in Richmond, Virginia.
"I would like to be a more successful attempt and a more successful finale for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond, and hopefully we'll get better there.
Stuart first landed in a building early in the race for the resurrection evening after meeting with Kyle Bush, who needed the repair of his vehicle's right side.
"I started today with a lot of hope of getting to the finish," said Johnston, adding, "I just didn't get it."
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded onto the evacuater, and the team was gathered and ready to leave.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup runners after his car broke down and killed another driver during a race on the ground traversing north of New York.
He decided to return this week, and he had to win either to Atlanta or to the next race in Richmond to participate in the persecution.
He returned to work during the investigation of a tragic incident that resulted in the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Mladshi, who went on a march to express Stuart's displeasure during the race.
The law enforcement authorities reported on Friday that the reason for the accident would continue for at least two more weeks.
The decision on whether Stuart would be charged was not taken.
The triangular champion was met with loud applause and applause when he was presented before the race.
I started with the 12th position, Stuart Shell at the first 10 at the beginning of the race, reaching the fourth position.
Then it's 122 rounds after Bush's restoration number.
The 18 machine came from a tractor on the way out of direction 2 and went to Stuart, and the two cars were locked in the wall.
Stuart continued, but remained until the 21st position.
Sobcak and Vitorgan are injecting cigarettes with Zvanzki in Odèsse
Xia Sobča and Maxim Vitorgan are now in Odèsse, where the TV never reported in their Instagram.
True, one photograph was very surprising and very disturbing to the couple’s worshipers.
Photo created in Zvancko.
"Tomorrow Michael Mihalach of Zvanzki Maxim explains that this is an instagram:) #odessa," she signed a photo of Ksien Sobča.
However, there is nothing on the table except cigarettes.
No coffee, no coffee, no butter, no more...

Bulgarian prison officials have conducted national protests
Hundreds of prisoners from all over Bulgaria have conducted a national protest before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
During the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands to return to the former conditions of work that had recently been changed.
The increase in pay is also included in the list of requirements to be discussed with the Minister of Justice of Christo Ivanov.
During the month, the officers expressed a symbolic protest against the new work schedule, demanding that the previous 24-hour shifts be returned.

The negotiations continue to be reported by the BNR to the Chief Executive of Rosen Jelazkov.
Members of the Federation of Professional Unions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs are expected to join in protest.
Army controls the new Government of Thailand
General Pratov (right) appointed the Minister for Defence of the Rights of the United Nations (left)
The military governor and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Praat Chan-Ocha, announced the composition of a new office of ministers in which more than one third of the posts are held by the General or the General.
Military representatives received key positions: defence ministers, finance, foreign affairs and trade.
On Monday, Praat Chan-Ocha was officially approved as Prime Minister after the appointment of the head of the interim military Government by King Thailand officially.
The 60-year-old military occupying power in the country as a result of the forced conversion on 22 May was the only candidate in the Prime Minister's position.
He was elected Prime Minister at the parliamentary meeting.
The former army has appointed Members of Parliament.
According to Prauta Chan-Ocha, the conversion was the only way to maintain stability.
He had been promoted by the ongoing demonstrations during which protestors demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yingla Chinavat.
Officially, Chan-Ocha will be a temporary prime minister, as the military plans to conduct a general election by the end of 2015.
However, there is a threat that soldiers are trying to strengthen their authority in the country.
Soldiers came to power on 22 May
On the basis of the full parallel of the civil authority.
The leaders of the main political parties were subjected to temporary arrest.
Shortly after the arrival of the military to the authorities, they had been temporarily arrested by the country's leaders, including Prime Minister Yingik Chinavat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis is similar to the one in 2006 when the army was formed as Prime Minister of Brother Yingik Chinavat Taxi.
Both have benefited from the popularity of the rural population, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has not always provided them with a successful election.
However, many representatives of the middle class and the capital elite came into the anti-government movement, which had been virtually paralysed by the country since November 2013.
No one ever said that the media room would be better, I didn't promise you that an officer from the new Palm Basser was looking for you.
It should be formally recognized that this is true, but the mind and the mind remain constant.
They've known it for a long time. We're talking Belgium -- we're talking media, we're talking media -- we're talking Belgium.
Restaurants like to say deeply that success depends on three factors: location, location and once again location.
There are places that don't have to be good, but they're even great, but there's something wrong.
Later, when I came across Palm's table, I remembered that sometimes there was a "Hordock" coffee (in honor of the same TV set), then "Odessa-Mama", and a restaurant "Bosole" and a beer company.
Now there's a beer here again, but it's not the Nazi-Soviet, it's the Belgian.
On the ground was just a high esberg: a bar stop and a pair of chairs, all the rest of the space was left to the sun.
That's why it's been fun here, like in the child's room: beautiful, green and green walls, colorful chairs, instead of window TVs, where girls swim.
The Belgian institutions in Petersburg have long been out of the news, so to compare it with what they have been doing.
Here are eight different kinds of beer (260-300 rubles per 0.5 l) and an countless number of bottlenecks (170-1550 rubles).
The company-positive officer is happy to present the menu, explaining that the media are the main major seeds, and should be noted: services, in spite of individual failures, is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is waiting for content, but often very unexpected.
For example, it has been suggested that a meat-roller with a balconium (280 rubles) is actually a carpach, which is so thin that the permanent book compares it to a matter of immeasurably thick.
It's possible to feel any taste, only if you break a bottle together.
It's even worse with salads.
The classic legend (260) would be more likely to recognize the crime against the Belgian people: some red esberg, once opened a long-lasting map, dissipating the Chinese fascist, torn chips from the bacon, plus some marinated lead.
You don't want to meet anyone with this lying salad!
The composition of the Belgian salad ingredients was partly different, but the impression was also not positive.
If the undisclosed quarter of the shells or the fireships were still able to close their eyes, why, the media would have been able to relax and open them several times in their lives!
I already know that there's a lot of regular balmorrhoids here!
They are placed in the "sustained" boxes (490-560 rubles per 0.5 kg).
The fruit of the vine, which was not from the vine, nor from the olive tree, nor from the vine, nor from the olive tree, nor from the olive tree, nor from the branches, nor from the branches, nor from the branches, nor from the branches, nor from the branches, nor yet from the branches, nor from the branches, nor from the branches, nor yet from the branches, nor from the branches, nor from the branches, nor yet from the branches, nor yet from the branches, nor from the branches, nor yet from the branches, nor from the branches, nor yet from the branches, nor yet
There's sheep, and there's no aroma, whether there's wine there or not, there's still something left.
That's why good people rely on the middle of the frits with the home menopause.
Curriculum is not a cold here, but to the extent that depending on the mood you can decide, the first or the second leaves before you, but just a pleasant slender soup.
It was said that a local dispute was being prepared in a beer sauce, and there was no mention of fraud.
On the surface of the situation, there was a diametrical contrast: the rose-marin had all of it shut down.
It was a impression that this crocodile was made to live in the cormula with extremely marinous cucumbers, from which the meat had acquired so many unusual aromas.
But there was a remarkable sign on the foot of the rabbit, but it was not just a repugnant bug in a caramelized short.
The waffles in Palm offer not only sweet, but also sweet, with meat, sugar or bacon and raw (220-280).
The clown fish was a seafarer, and the waffles were dried.
But when the manager came to the table, he was very curious about the impressions.
So it should come again.
The course of the dollar raised more than 37 rubles on the news of new sanctions against Russia in the West.
It's a new historical record.
The dollar calculated "morning" to 10:29 msk rose to 26.9 kpebile and constituted 37.02 rupees, the euro rate rose to 30 kpebiles, up to 48.73 rupees, according to the data of the Moscow bureaux.
The bivalve root grew to 28 cups to the previous level of closure and stood 42.28 rubles.
Prior to the Russian developments, the dollar reached a maximum of 36,43 rubles on 19 February 2009 and was already 37.005 rubles on 3 March 2014.
On the night of 29 August, the White House reported that US President Barak Obama and Chancellor Angel Merkel were discussing the possibility of additional sanctions against Russia.
The reduction of the ruble is long-term, and in currency with euro, and in currency with dollar.
The long-term forecast suggested this note, says senior analyst Anna Bodrova.
Everything related to Ukraine will be reflected in courses.
As long as it continues, investors will respond.
Today, there is no sign of the invasion of the army, but the market has become very emotional.
All the discussions about his standing up to such news were cancelled yesterday.
The week, according to experts' estimates, around these levels is $36,90 and $37,05.
The tax period has ended, low oil prices, policies, sanctions, gas transit problem through Ukraine -- all of this is outside one cup.
The inflation rate is also projected: the current price for the sun is between 5 and 10 per cent.
Soon, however, seasonal fruit and fruit will end, and a vacuum will occur until the networks are refocused on other suppliers.
"The dollar came to the mark in 37 rubles, passed it and returned back, without any strong stereo, - comments the head of the Open Broker Market Analysis Division Constantin Bushuev.
They will still see whether the proposed sanctions will be imposed on Saturday, as will the NATO meeting.
Ruble, he said, was very weak after the end of the tax season and then went to the news on Ukraine, and the CB stated last week that by the end of the year, it had completely moved to the floating course and had refused any monetary intervention.
If we look at the daily clock, it was nothing different than the previous months of this month, all of us were threatened with a note in 37 rubles, and the analysis continues.
And yes, nothing happened in the course of the traffic.
The alarming times for the currency market were remembered when, at the end of January, there was an increased demand for currency, as well as on the third March, when the CB had exhausted the record amount of the currency.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of the rubella weakness.
First of all, this increase in the income budget from export operations, as well as the increased competitiveness of domestic producers through import control, is the main analysis of UFS IC Alexei Kozlov.
The travel of import goods and services can be made at negative times.
The decline in Russian currency has significantly reduced the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, led to inflationary pressure, and as a result, it has become a cause for money laundering, which, in turn, has brought the country's economy to a halt.
In terms of the shares market, the valuation of the rubella is somewhat similar to the lower price of the shares expressed in the rubles.
For example, the IMF Index in the fourth trade decreased by 1.67 per cent and the RTS Index lost 3.27 per cent.
The significant difference in the relatively decrease in index size is due to a decrease in the volume during the day more than 1.5 per cent.
The reduction of the ruble is emotional and is driven by a massive desire to buy money.
As the practice shows, emotions gradually go to the net, and rubles partially or completely recover lost positions.
"We believe that soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency around the 36 rubles for the dollar," notes Alexei Kozlov.
Genetic violation is often misdiagnosed
The British reported that she had spent many years thinking she was dying after a misdiagnosed diagnosis.
Karin Rogers had spent most of her teenage years thinking that she was still living for a few years after she was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had a disease of Sharko Marie-Tuta (SPT) - a group of hereditary violations that cause nerve damage outside the brain and the phone.
The grateful CMT UK reported that misdiagnosed diagnosis was a common problem among people with SMT, since it was little known about this condition.
There are some 23,000 people in Britain, it is estimated that there are STMTs that can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, incredible walk and lower legs.
Pain may be felt by the sufferer or pain, and the condition does not heal and progress, which means that symptoms are being intensified over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought that she was suffering from Fredreh (AF) attack - a condition for which the forecast was very bad.
Rogers thought she'd be stuck in a wheelchair until she was 18, and she'd die before she was 30.
The mother of two children, who are now 51, said: "I knew that I couldn't do what others did.
I fell every day, and I had more time.
I've never been able to sit on a wheelchair or skateboard with other kids, and I have to get out of school because I've been running and running.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several operations to release her ahyllics and to repair her feet, she looked into a medical card when her doctor took her out of the room, and it was written that she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because I was wearing a nose that didn't belong, and that's why I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, found information about this condition in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I received information in response, I was shocked and tested the most terrible panic, which was possible.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I'm done 25 and I'd gradually lose all my abilities in this interval.
I went through this one, and I planned my own funerals.
She said that by the time she was 17 she realized that her ability to walk had not diminished as much as she thought and asked her doctor about it.
He just got up and woke me up and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease because you're already in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that represents a very little risk to your life.
After several genetic studies, it was found by the STD.
"When he explained that such an MST, I thought it took a happy ticket," she said.
The grateful organization of the United Kingdom of Great Britain announced a month of information on the GST to try to draw attention to this disease.
Tax burden on entrepreneurs of the Washington Zone is growing as the economy is restored
The recovery economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
The state-paying and local-level accounts for companies across the country have increased significantly in the past year when economic recovery has been accelerated, according to the new study published last week, and the company in the Washington area is not excluded.
The companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia totaled $27.6 billion in state-run punishment and at local financial level in 2013, at 3.8 per cent more than $26.6 billion in 2012.
Tax burden on state and local business over the past year increased by 4.3 per cent, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent a year earlier, and this was a third-year increase after the next year when the accounts decreased in 2009 and 2010.
State-owned taxes increased faster, 4.3 per cent more than local taxes, 3.9 per cent, according to the study conducted by the company providing professional services, Ernst & Young and the State Tax Centre, a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax revenues in the area, 56 per cent, are taxed by entrepreneurs, while 36 per cent of Maryland tax revenues are paid by companies.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, represents the lowest level of tax income, proportionally from entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, the increase in tax revenues due to the return to the former value of the company ' s real estate, researchers say that there was a 3.7 per cent increase this year after three years of decline when the increase was less than 1 per cent.
While the large proportion of these revenues are coming to large states, such as California, New York and Texas, the same appears to be happening in the Washington area.
The companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia totaled $10 billion on state-owned and local-level taxation last year, at $9.6 billion more than in 2012 than at 4.2 per cent, compared with the previous year.
However, the observed return on real estate has no similar effect on the increase in state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where the real estate taxes are barely higher than one fifth of the company's tax accounts.
The companies of Virginia and the District of Colombia pay about half of the state and local tax accounts in the form of real estate taxes.
"What is going on in Maryland is that much of their immutableness, especially the tax base around the District of Colombia, belongs either to the Government or to non-commercial organizations that do not pay for real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of the State Tax Centre.
Thus, Maryland has to rely much more on, for example, on appropriate taxes to pay the same services that are available in other countries.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot fully explain the realisation of the real estate market.
Entrepreneurships also appear to be in line with these data.
Companies in the region have declared corporate income tax at the state level of $2.3 billion to $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion of corporate income from income tax, mostly in the region.
Although trends are addressed in one direction, the tax burden on local entrepreneurs is not increased at the same rate in all three places.
The level of growth in Colombia was at the same level as the average country, 4.3 per cent, while growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 per cent.
Only in Virginia, the tax income rate is below the average, 4.1 per cent.
In Virginia, the lowest corporate income tax from three jurisdictions (each of which is the same corporate rate) was equal to 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the area it is relatively high - 9.975 per cent.
A study of the United States Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that in Virginia, taxes are lower for entrepreneurs at the state and local level and, in general, a more favourable climate with regard to taxes for entrepreneurs than in Maryland.
The area was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantages, Virginia is experiencing competitive pressure from its neighbor from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a legislative act reducing the corporate rate in this year from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, as in Virginia, and the rate falls to 5 per cent next year.
If the State continues to achieve tax revenues in the following year, this law could bring a tax rate to entrepreneurs up to 3 per cent by 2017.
At the same time, small businesses in the Washington area seem to feel better and thus pay more taxes on the state and at the local level, according to a recent study.
The individual income tax tax paid by small business owners is the transitional structure for which most small companies have been established - in the District of Colombia, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 per cent in the past year to $2.4 billion, with a high rate of increase than taxes for entrepreneurs in general.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in tax revenues from businesses across the country, at least in this year, will be maintained in the country and local government turnover, which increased by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington area can be abandoned as the reduction of federal expenditure affects the labour market in the region.
The Iron Age of the Russian Dhudo
The home world champion on the bridge brought two silver medals and seven bronze prizes to Russia.
This shows that only the main favorite of the sorority was Japan's collection.
The tournament in Chelabinsk started on Monday, and the first day the Russian army brought a silver medal.
Its owner became Beslan Mudranos, a category of up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in the same final battle with Boldbabatater Ganbata from Mongolia, the source of the opposition was a single comment received by the Russians.
The next day, the tournament became the most successful for Russia's collection of three medals on Tuesday.
In male interviews, up to 66 kg of serebron reached Mikhail Pulaev, and the bronze was Camalu Han-Magomed.
In the final one, the Russians joined the 2011 and 2013 World Championship of Japan, Massasi Ebinum.
Han-Magomed, at the fourth-final stage of the missing relative, has been successful in a comfortable tournament and has become the owner of a bronze prize.
In the female tournament of the category up to 52 kg and up to the third grade, Natalya Kuzotina received the first five.
In the semi-final, she lost the current World Championship, Mailland Kelmendi from Kosovo, which was under the flag of the International Federation of Judo and successfully protected the title.
In the contest for the custodian bronze, Ma Inan from China won, but after the tournament ended, it was recognized that the third place was not what she was counting on.
And once again, the Russians' turning to gold became Kelmendi, winning Kuwait's first prize at the end of the European Championship.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelábinsk, in a collection of Russians, Moses Moguškov placed up to 73 kg.
In the fourth round, his successor became the former representative of Moldova, Victor Skovorov, who is now speaking on the OAU team.
Then, however, the Russian won two awards and became the winner of the prize.
He was able to speak at a home chimpanzees with a sick golnosto, which he plans to treat in the near future, so he will take a break in the meetings.
As for the ex-moldoon of Skuorzov, he and he were in this tournament before the bronze medal.
Interestingly, another of his associates, who accepted the sport citizenship of the OAU, Ivan Remarenko, had concluded a sentence of up to 100 kg.
On the fourth day of the CM-2014, the Russians also brought one bronze, which was held up to 81 kg in the category of Ivan Nifontos.
In the heavy fighting of the small Finala, he won the Frenchman Alan Schmitt for his comments.
On Friday, three sets of prizes were held, but traditional growth was limited to one brunt in a man tournament of up to 90 kg.
Its holder became Cyrillic Question, which guaranteed that the medal was collected by Russia: the competitor was Cyril Danisov.
However, the very understanding was not found: the opponent of Question was unable to go to the fathers because of the trauma.
The men's bronze was fought by farmers, and on the sixth day of the siege, it was placed in a collection bag of over 100 kg by Renat Said.
In a comforting finale, he won a clean victory over the Brazilians of David Moura.
Thus, the individual part of the world empire was completed.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on the resurrection day, the names of the world champions were played at the command competitions.
Both Russian and male congregations and women were one of the main bidders for the prize, but, as in individual interviews, the representatives of the beautiful sex did not get along until the medal.
This is where Russian judoists took the command serebro.
In a decisive contrast, they have taken the lead in the fight against 2-3, the Japanese team.
At that time, the Russian Federation claimed 2 to 0 following the clean conquest of Han-Magomadov and the free Danis Yarceva (up to 73 kg).
However, they were unable to handle Murat Habachirov (81), Magomed Magomed (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100).
The same scenario also developed a bronze match in the women's tournament, where the Russian assembly, 2-0, joined Japan - 2-3.
Russian President Vladimir Putin was present at the command meetings in Chelábinsk, and after the tour ended, he welcomed the men's meeting with the serebre.
"The second place is very respectable, but I want to say that it was obvious that you could be champions," said Putin, whose word is the RIA "News".
The Japanese, the grandfathers, there's nothing to be ashamed of.
But I'm sure you can win them.
The Russian Federation at the World's Home Championship was much better than a year ago at a similar level in Rio de Janeiro.
At that time, there were only three medals in the Russian army -- one silver and two bronze.
The current tournament was attended by the Olympic champions Arsen Galstian and Mansour Isaev.
We're all, of course, the greatest.
Yeah, I want gold medals.
But remember, if a man in the Olympics is in the eighth most powerful cycle, he is the potential winner of the Olympics.
It is more like a judo" - the results of the tournament Minister of the RF Vitaly Mutko sport, whose word leads to the press service of the champion.
Japan’s congregation expected to be a better place in Chelabinsk, bringing 11 medals of various value, five of which were made of gold.
The next World Championship will be held in Astana next year.
Other materials, news and statistics can be found on the page of summer sports.
The John Rivers family is hoping for the best.
Joan Rivers is unconscious of coming to a hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter has expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedy will recover from the disease.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai's hospital on Thursday after an extra call about her having a heart attack at the hospital in the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscope, reported sources.
Doctors will keep her under drugs and strict surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains “hard”.
The response was widespread, including numerous Internet support from such individuals as Donald Trump, Montele Williams and Kelly Ripa.
All the Kings Can Do
In selling the debut album of the Royal Blood team, a new hope for the British year, which took the two-year-olds out of clubs on stage.
Two Royal Blood each year on stage, but already has an active nomination for the BBC musical prize, a tour of the Arctic Monkeys, and a visit to the New York concert player by Jimmy Paige himself.
Their debut album was a few months before the release of 100 thousand copies, and the contract to be issued is in the Major-Lebble Warner Music portfolio.
In view of the current crying situation on the music market, the situation from a number of exits is not about the new Lane Del Ray or the regular sweetener of the "new R'n'B" and about the doubts of the British players who played with this level of volume and intensity, which was the last time in fashion a couple of decades ago.
In general, the rates for the first album in relation to all the above-mentioned circumstances have been particularly high and have already been fully justified.
The two did not see a name on which they had been able to overcome the fact that the already desperate metallicists had already died, and the blood of the kings who seem to have been in their homes is also understandable.
The thing is, of course, mainly about the heroes of the previous level of Led Zeppelin: like a large quarter, Royal Blood is aimed at combating the blood of the British year by bringing it to new heights.
To predict the success of this company until, please, the morning, but something can be said.
The Ten Songs, which were put in 30 minutes, is not only a demonstration of phenomonic composition, but also a reliable and powerful declaration of intentions.
Some of the values of individual numbers, of course, can't be denied: say, the pilot's ring "Out Of The Black" is what is left of not a melodic line but a drum party.
The performers say that this song is much easier to push than to drink.
It is also possible to assign the powerful Little Monster and the closing plate of the Best Strangers with the Shexpirovic Quote in the title.
It is true, however, that each of these songs will sound excellent at the dinner of lovers of the year, but when they are played, they fall into more or less of an international field.
And that's not necessarily bad, even the opposite.
The Royal Blood Force did not claim new Lennon and McCartney's labs, but took out a number of ro-dots from the India clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity, was created for stadiums, in a space of less than a thousand people, apparently close to it.
The secret part of the base using the base replaced by the normal form suggested at the beginning of the zeros The White Stripes.
On the other hand, it is not only in instruments but also in the way of the composition of the song.
Heroes of the zeros with great work were chosen outside the post-modern paradigm, with great difficulty to recognize themselves not just as epigons but as independent creative units.
Royal Blood now sounds so strong and insists that this effort has successfully affected some secondaryity and strength of musical material.
Well, at the end of the day, who said the rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON has only confirmed what information was reported on Friday morning: Online store and videostore, and hundreds of other items, is buying the current video production service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($US790 million).
The news was surprising not because no one expected that Twitch would be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, Google's Twitch video server for a good billion looked completely ready, and this combination seemed natural.
Twitch, based almost three years ago as Justin.tv, has set the goal of being a general service - YouTube version in real time.
Instead, he quickly turned to a platform where the gays transpired their internal moments; "Youtube for a real time game", according to Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And let's play, a genre of videomakers who give (mainly, old) a game of processing like in the Secret Theatre, already popular on YouTube.
The fact that YouTube is often mentioned when it is described in Twitter is so the news that YouTube acquires it has been met with no special interest, a classic example of a sophisticated technology company that purchases potential competitors.
That's why the YouTube deal failed, considering that, according to the evidence, he was willing to pay less than Amazon.
All we have right now is a statement by Executive Director Twitch Emmet Shira: "We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another secret, honestly speaking, is the amazing success of Twitch.
My dreams, which say that it would be better to play sports than to look at it, are hard to understand the attractiveness of watching games rather than to take it personally.
One thing is to look through the other's face on the 3th of the morning when it passes through the Resident Evil, and the other, to see how some outside person gets 20 shots in the head at Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are counted on one person, so looking at them, without self-control of the angle of view, can be a recipe for the headache that is worth Do It Right.
I agree that the speedy transitions in which Roger Bennisters of our century complete all the games in record time are fun.
But if it's not about the vertuosity of the game or the monster, it's unlikely that his Twitch channel will be quite interesting.
But what do sceptics know about me?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, and this is the fourth largest Internet traffic source.
How does Amazon work on this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch will return to Amazon Instant Video just as brilliant as YouTube could just watch Twitch.
However, Twitch is what any company would be pleased to have: the crowds of young men who are dreaming of advertising.
As Twitch Shir, Amazon and Twitch said, "they both believe in the future game", and this channel does not give clues, even the ego - as an adult form of sport.
As a result of the 2004 earthquake, more than 330 people, including 186 children, were killed.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
They spoke with survivors - almost all of the students, with the parents of the deceased, with the observatory of the City of Angelov - Ramona Caspolatian, head of the Committee of Mothers Beslan of Sussan Dudios, who participated in the operation of an MIC staff member, - - told the corresponding department of Elizabeth Antonov, who worked on the project.
On his return to Moscow, they met Aslambe Aslahanov, who had been the adviser to the president of North Caucasus for 10 years and had been negotiating with terrorists, as well as with the Russian Federation administration officer "B" for the celebration of the Bocarov."
What especially disappointed me during my work on this subject was that it wasn't in Beslan for the last ten years.
This subject is very painful for all who have something to do with it, people with difficulty agree to talk about what has happened.
The impressions of the trip are very difficult.
But I can't forget Beslan, and I hope we're done with our task," said Antonov.
The project was prepared by the Dutch Rambler & Co infoography study, which has been working with the company since the year.
The previous specific projects were devoted to World War I and the 15th anniversary of the residence of Vladimra Putin in power.
KNDR implemented the launch of a small remote rocket
North Korea has launched small-scale rockets in the Japanese seawater, reports Renhap.
The launch took place about 10.30 a.m. on a local basis from the province of Chagando, located on the border of North Korea and China.
It is estimated that the rocket landed in the Japanese sea, some 220 miles [220 km], in the Joint Committee of Heads of South Korea's Headquarters.
Members suggested that the entry into force of the Staff Data Act be accelerated
In the event of success of the initiative, Russians will not be able to store data on foreign servers since 1 January 2015
The Lord introduced a draft law providing for the transfer of the date of entry into force of the Act on Russian Personal Data from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is based on the legislative activities of the lower room.
Its sponsors were Mr. Vadim Dügin, Mr. Yaroslav Nilov (LDR), Mr. Fedrov ( "United Russia"), Mr. Vladimir Parakin (Russian only") and Mr. Alexander Yuttenko (KPRF).
Such a change, in the view of the authors of the initiative, will contribute to the more prompt and effective realization of the rights of RFF citizens to the maintenance of personal data and to compliance with the confidentiality of the information and telecommunications networks.
The entry into force of a law by parliamentarians requires that the personal data of Russians processed via the Internet be stored on the territory of the RF.
It also makes mandatory records, systemization, storage, storage, clarification and extraction of personal data of RF citizens in databases located in the territory of Russia, as well as information on the location of such databases.
In addition, the Law confers upon the Roscomorgor the right to restrict access to information processed in breach of the RFP law in the field of personal data.
The Act also proposes the establishment of so-called “black lists” sites of offenders - an automated information system entitled “Registration of the rights of offenders of personal data subjects”.
This law was adopted by the Lord in the summer.
The authors of the project made statements by Andrey Lugovoy and Vadim Düggin of LDR and Alexander Yuttenko of CPRF.
Düggin and Juttenko are also one of the authors of the current bill on the transfer of the date of entry into force of the Act.
Those who don't have data centres in the RFI will have to pay for the rent.
Commenting on the draft legislation introduced to the Lord today, the first closed committee on information policy, Leonid Levin stated that he did not see any problem with the transfer of the date of entry into force of the data protection law.
According to him, those companies that would not have their own personal data storage in the RF territory by 1 January 2015 would be able to purchase them, for example, "in Rostelcoma," which has repeatedly said that they are willing to provide their servers in the lease and are already providing their servers, in the Mail Group, to Western companies that are already providing their servers."
"There are also several independent data centres ready to cooperate in this area," he added.
"If companies decide to implement the law and continue to work on the territory of the RFI, I don't see the problem - they will get technological opportunities to move," Levin said.
Suspension of legislation
Shortly after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Electronic Communications Association expressed the fear that, in the event of the adoption of the draft legislation, there would be no longer access to many global Internet services.
In particular, it concerns online aviation and hotels services.
In the view of the association, “the bill deprives individuals of the right of the Russian Federation to manage their own data in an imperative manner, that their records, systemization and etc. should be provided only on databases located within the territory of the Russian Federation”.
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to establish a user-information mechanism on where the record is made, the system of its personal data.
In this case, it is possible to choose which territory the action will take.
The adoption of such legislation on the location of personal data in other countries has led to global services and significant economic losses.
The ice-cream test was performed by an outlet
Isabelle Roberts from Britain cried so much when the ice water was poured on her head, which damaged the bone structure of the person.
It's a test of ice water that's not like that.
The woman was hospitalized after she cried as she cried during a cold water test, resulting in blindness.
Isabelle Roberts was so furious when the ice water was poured on her head that it damaged the structure of the person.
"The water was so cold that I cried, but when I did it, my face began to shoot," she said.
They've been drinking water for 20 years.
Isabel Roberts for seconds until the accident.
I tried to close my mouth, but he didn't close, he shot, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister came to the same understanding and began to cry, but I had to go to the emergency office.
A 20-year-old woman from Britain was taken to the hospital to conduct a funeral after her participation in a public service on Tuesday.
The clip became Internet-sensation and was published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The officers transferred more than 400 troops to the Ukrainian military
In the Army of Novorossia, they claim that the Ukrainian Su-27 has been defeated and accused of violating the ceasefire agreement.
On 1 September, the officers transferred 402 troops to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as 35 dead soldiers.
The representative of the Press Service of the Army of New York reported to Interfax about this.
He added that “by the PWO forces in the area of the population of Mereshki, the Su-27 aircraft violated the ceasefire agreement”.
According to a meeting of the agency, the Ukrainian side of the Lugan airport had applied the banned international conventions of cluster munitions.
The representative of the press noted that night soldiers had been able to hurt two Ukrainian VVVV helicopters at one of the field airports, and destroyed two bront carriers and two ammunition warehouses.
"The lives of the opponent -- up to a hundred people killed and wounded, 13 people were killed," the representative of the headquarters summarized.
Interfax has no confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
The armed formation of the “National Republic” of Donbass announced the transfer of the Ukrainian side in compliance with the ceasefire regime of 223 full soldiers and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine.
At the same time, during the night, the DDR Army, according to the "Armiya Novorossie", "sexeded the efforts of the Nagvardians in breach of previous agreements to remove heavy technology from the area".
The militia then reported on the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs in a short time, including six tanks and 198 military personnel.
According to the headquarters, the total loss of the opponent in all directions (donets, Lugans, Mariupol) by night was five tanks, eight war machine guns, more than 120 people killed and wounded.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian military personnel took place in the area of Ilovakia in the Danube region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin requested the leadership of the “national republics” to expel Ukrainian military officers from the area.
The DDR agreed to do so under the terms of the arms and ammunition counter-attack.
The first ten military officers began to leave the surrounding settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the battalion of the Ukrainian territorial defense "Donbass" of Semenchenko, 14 more rose on the night of the resurrection from "the tower".
In her Facebook book Semenčenko, the Ukrainian wounded are “full of 137 fields of 32 RF divisions and 9 RF tanks” where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the MDGs and the Minoborons of Russia have examined reports from Ukrainian military and NATO on the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
MID RF: Russia will take action in the event of the introduction of new EU sanctions
Russia reserves the right to respond to measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-virus sanctions, reports the MDG.
The report of the Russian External Diplomatic Office states that the European Council ' s closures from 30 August have demonstrated the inability of EU Member States to overcome the introductory support of their key authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, based on “absolutely unconfirmed allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces in the territory of the country”, the agency's website said.
MID RF regrets that, despite the interests of its Member States, it is under the influence of countries that are interested in strengthening the conflict with Russia.
The members of the European Union should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as provide conditions for a comprehensive dialogue between the opposing parties, the Government stressed.
The Bureau's website also notes that there is no objective assessment of the humanitarian situation in Donbass, where there has been a comprehensive humanitarian disaster, as well as the number of victims among the peaceful population.
We remember that during the coming week in the European Union , specific sanctions proposals are being developed.
Representatives of the EU are working closely with US officials.
They are expected to correlate among themselves the measures introduced during the period of action and the degree of cruelty.
The new EU sanctions can be severed by energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government also announced an increase in sanctions against Russia in the field of defence, finance and the oil industry.
Quick ways to earn money on university teachers
While the cost of university teachers for many students exceeds $1,000 per year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move on to the second course, made an urgent way to reduce costs.
He developed a system to take books to seniors, offering them a nominal compensation to pay off their sales.
"My math-analysis teacher, normally worth $180, I got $10 a semester and the Chick-fil-A coin," says Shryöder, 19 years old, who is studying at the Convenant College in Georgia.
The required literature last semester would be $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the Board of Colleges, the average student spends over $1,200 a year on students and educational assets, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas, such as the Shreder system.
The procrastination of the book is increasingly popular, allowing students to use the book during the semester, and it is often more expensive than buying it.
The company Nibo Incorporateid, which belongs to more than 250 university libraries, reports that the probation of the book has grown twice since 2011.
Industry studies show that about a quarter of the bookstores in the university library have been re-enacted during the past half-year period, says Vice-President Trevor Meier.
Less than half of all books are obtained at university libraries, according to the Professional Association of National University Magazines.
Here's the introduction course for the best ways to make a good deal.
Buying online store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price for a new book can be one third of what you see in a university library.
The ninth edition of the "Mathematical Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hosteller is about $290 per exam, but a new sample can be obtained for $239.99 on the Chegg.com website, which specializes in the sale of teachers.
Purchase of the held
If you're not against foreign brands or injuries, the teachers are a good option.
The Mathematical Analysis is sold at $93.49 in a maintained form at Chegg.com.
Matt Casey, aged 25, a student at the University of Brigham Young, says he paid 42 cents to Amazon.com for a supported example of the "Strategical Media Decision: Understanding of the Business Side of Advertising".
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, for example, Ingrid Breese, director of the College without walls at the University of Massachusetts in Emherst, are offering students to clarify to their professors whether they can use previous publications.
There are times when updating is not essential for employment.
In such cases an old edition can often be found as a very small part of the value of the last edition.
In addition to the Chegg and Amazon websites, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying supported books.

In order to take the teachers away, you should think that if you are good enough to talk to them, don't forget them and don't want to leave them after the course is over.
You can save more than 80% of the value of the new book.
For example, one student was able to take the "Mathematical Analysis" average for about $20.
Explain the rules of the store where you are taking books, including any taxes that may be written on your notes, accents and damages.
If you take a copy of the book, remember: If you don't return the book, the taxes may even exceed the value of a new sample.
E-books
Electronic books instead of traditional teachers are another option.
At times, such books are self-contained by obtaining e-licence for a certain period of time for distributors, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The "Mathematical Analysis" brochure on the Chegg.com website is available for about $61 in six months.
Bruce says that students studying literature can often find the most rewarding prices, as many classics can now jump free, while literature on natural and engineering sciences can be very expensive.
Whatever, check it out.
Joe Golt, 29 years old, who is going to start training at the Pepperdin Legal School, recommends using the ISBN number to clarify the price of the book, as this ensures that you are looking for the text you need.
Before ordering the Internet, Golt says, you must check if the book really is in the warehouse.
It was not easy for him to learn that lesson.
The delivery of the book he had received was postponed for four weeks, and finally he paid a full price at the university library.
Putin stated that the Development Fund for the Far East had been ineffective
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, said at a meeting on priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget for the development of the Far East, established two years ago, had not been effective, reports Interfax.
"15 billion rubles remain on deposits," the president stressed.
During the meeting, the Head of State had instructed the adoption of a list of developing lands in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the establishment of TOROs should be submitted to the Lord in this regard.
The Federal Assembly, noting the President until 1 July, has not yet approved the list of the areas of development in the Far East and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin also outlined key challenges for the development of the Far East.
Among them, increased transport access to the region, removal of infrastructure restrictions - both on the internal market and on export development.
In addition, it was necessary to establish proposals for attracting additional investment in the region, as well as to shape developing areas that should be competitive in relation to key business centres of ATP, the President stressed.
It was previously reported that the ODA could be replaced by the ODA.

Silver Steele returned less than $30 million from its $90 million budget in the United States, while the City of Sin: a woman to be killed for that purpose returned only $12 million from her $70 million budget.
The "Home Video" with Cameron Dias brought only $14.6 million in first exits, while children's films, such as "How to Hand Dragon 2" also disappoint the spell.
The article on the Chincritique of the Telegraph of Dr. Collins points out that when it comes to child films, it may be bad as movies.
Colin referred to 2014 as "the worst" year in the history of children's films, and called "How to handle Dragon 2" as a "functioning" extension.
However, when it comes to films directed to audiences of a number of older ages, the problem seems to be not necessarily the same as films.
In July Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of each film film, which took at least 2000 copies between the Memorial Day in May and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results that take into account the views of both Kinserians and cynics suggest that this year’s production of films is similar to that of previous hits.
Some commentators suggest that the case may be in changing attitudes and increasing popularity of stream Internet services such as Netflix.
Director John Favro, who is currently working on the project of the "Book of Jungle" series, said to the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think time is changing."
We must admit this and do not try to regret what happened earlier.
In contrast to the current drop in cash collection in Hollywood, Netflix's income from current production services reached $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as the last year's figure of $337 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studies for being too dependent on French comics, and predicted the "Creature" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current fall, some commentators claim that his dark predictions were part of the truth.
As a result, a number of potential casino hits are expected to emerge in the summer of 2015, including the Artists: Eri Altron, Minion and the Juric Park, the other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
"People X" producer Simon Kimberg recently called the fall of cassette collections simply "cyclic," said Hollywood Reporter, "the next summer will be the best cashier in history, and no one will ever survive."
The product sanctions do not frighten the owners of the Caucasus and Central Asian Edo, but for the restaurants of the European and Japanese cuisine Russian suppliers is a scary dream.
As a general rule, it is preferable to place banned imports not from Russia but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"There's a little bit worse than a bad mozarel," the head of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Mariano Valerio on the quality of beer offered by Italian suppliers.
Mozarella and the cheese of the burritas ended up in the restaurant for the first time, with little time to eat.
The stock must be caught for a few months.
What to do?
Go to Russia?
In 2005, I was on the Dorgomilov market.
Mariano Valerio makes this clear: shocking memories do not leave him until now.
The meat was lying on the roofs almost 30 inches [30 cm] from the ground!
There you go!
Chris!
Then I said that for our restaurant we would never buy anything on Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe now everything's changed.
But these days they brought me a fish from the Far East.
That's what happened!
I said I don't even want to talk to the man who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many ordinary things for Italy are for the Russian producer in the kitchen.
A few years ago, I was forced to buy a Russian dog.
In Italy, meat is added to the refrigerator for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It must be leaned to make it soft so that the muscles get weaker.
I've done all this with the local chef.
Then I was asked, "Where did you get that little meat?"
I said, "That's yours, Russian!"
Why don't you guys do that?
Within five minutes of a walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant Brasserie Most, the kitchen views a stop-list with the missing products: French dishes, sea meals.
The head of the Brasserie Most restaurant and the search for "Strellka" Regis Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: French resistors have already replaced the ruins of Tunisia, and instead of French spies, the restaurant will buy Swiss.
In addition, the regime is becoming more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "The color coat is 200 rubles!
I ask, "Why is she so good?"
They say, "We have to work too."
But it shouldn't be about 80 rubles!
We're buying the east wind in weight, but they're 15-20 years old, you know, how much do you think they're wearing?
It's highly valued. It's superdelicat.
Russian suppliers seem to be one of the main sources of fear for foreign disputes.
The standard story: "The first three months were good, then the quality fell very low."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot maintain stable calibers and quality.
Many restaurants in Europe don't know that they'll be with them when they're done with cheese.

Sanctions Menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure the safety of Russia, which are called the main product sanctions.
The country is prohibited to import beef, pig, meat and sub-products from poultry, meat, fish, molluscs, milk, yogurt, creature, cheese, fruit, fruit, rice, beans and sugar syrups.
Restaurants started with suppliers: prices for products have increased, and the comparisons from other countries need to be urgently sought.
More strongly, this is said to be on the streets of monocochne France, Italy, Spain, where products were placed directly from the “mother countries”.
The audience had come to rest before.
For example, at the beginning of 2014, Rosellhodisdor prohibited the importation of Australian beef and the previous year of American and Canadian meat.
In exchange, suppliers have established supplies of cattle from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions of the summer-2014 were much more serious.
True, on 20 August, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved an amendment to the presidential order, which was issued under the prohibition of small Atlantic salmon and forebears, non-lactose milk, seed potatoes, sugarcane, corn and rice.
Italian Valerio expects sanctions to be lifted.
As long as part of the restaurant exists in conditions of uncertainty.
According to the West Bank company, one of the largest suppliers of HoreCa, the proportion of imports in the primary segment was 70 per cent.
“The other restaurants will have to change the menu of local farmers and other countries,” says Sergei Mironov, director, owner of the Resconsult Agency.
If the boss is strong, it won't be a problem for him.
We only have very few of these conflicts, and a new menu can be developed for two or three months.
Trigel from the Brasserie Most restaurant is ready to give up 10-15% of the leaves and half of the menu is to be processed.
In restaurants with mixed kitchens, the leaves are already being replaced by leaves, such as a stick from the brownhead on the bifstrogans, says Sergei Mironov.
"The cheese from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian, Serbian, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile - lists the representative of the West West company Oksana Glibbchuk.
Smells and milk production from Europe are similar in Russia and Belarus.
The U.S. can be replaced by a cookie from Russia and Belarus, a forest and seven from Norway - forest, a seed, a factory from Belarus and Chile.
The absence of fruit and fruit of European production can be compensated for the production of domestic producers proposed by Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, the budget network will be refurbished more than the primary segment, whether there have been grunts capable of separating the Italian mozarel from Russia.
Although it is difficult to reach the Ginza Project, he considers it to be.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under various brands and with their menus.
They're going to spend time with the dog instead," says Mironov.
In Ginza, comments were rejected, referring to the lack of ownership in the country.
Caucasian and Mediterranean chefs stress that the products from the former Soviet republics are more aromatic than Europeans
But there are no restaurants where sanctions are practically impossible.
These include the SNG kitchen facilities: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive products in the Georgian kitchen," says Hatuna Kolbay, the owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and coffee.
All the cheeses are made for us in Russia, on the basis of a lot of blood -- the cornfield, the exotic green we don't use."
In the Colba's holdings, they haven't picked up any leaves from the menu yet.
Timor-Leste, owner of the Chihon N1 restaurant with the Uzbek kitchen, also does not mind the sanctions: it will only have to be replaced with a New Zealand yogurt.
If Russia has imported from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win the price, for us it will be worse than imports from Europe, he says.
It is possible to get a taste of espresso, enamel, peppers, oats, fruits.
In addition, the imports from Central Asia are much better than the plastic from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
About the Uzbek landscapes, everyone knows they're delicious, sweet.
No one's talking about Spanish like that.
Following the imposition of sanctions, the representative of Minsk, Uzbekistan, Olymboy Artivov, stated that he plans to increase the export of fruit products to Russia by two by 2016.
Its intention was to place European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions by Belarus and Kazakhstan.
Restaurants who responded to Deneng's request also responded calmly to sanctions.
McDonald's Press Service stated that the location exceeded 85 per cent and the network was working with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatian Bosdan, director of the Subway Russian supply department, about 80 per cent of the products are purchased in Russia, although temporary difficulties may arise with supplies of fruit and vegetables at increased prices for meat products produced from imported material.
There were no more than 4 per cent of "tax products" in the Land.
They didn't touch the sanctions and the walker.
KFC, Burger King and the Red Card did not respond to Deneng's request, but other market participants claim that Burger King's location is significantly lower than McDonald's.

On your back.
Meanwhile, restaurants complain that prices are growing even on local products due to increased demand.
"The prices for the Graffles increased by 10-15 per cent on average, for the Italian Cherry Mio restaurant twice," said journalist Roman Rožnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the population will grow by 5-10 per cent, and it recognizes Colombia.
The West Bank does not deny this: "For example, the Belarusian milk production from the beginning of August was 10-15 per cent".
"The Brazilian suppliers have raised prices on pigs nearly twice, and Sergei Rac, Deputy Director General Stardods, complains.
The cancer rate was 35 per cent.
We're waiting for a price from China, maybe they're burning Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardox will be expected to increase the price by 8 per cent.
Now it's so unsatisfying to raise prices, says Rac.
According to statistics, the second quarter of 2014 totals 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest indicator after 2010.
The various prices will grow further, but it does not agree with the rapid pace of growth: until the majority of the restaurants have invested in products for the next two months in hopes of transfer of purchase prices.
But after two months, no one knows.

This is a regional festival called "There is time".
"We've been going to have a local dinner party for a long time, and here we've been taxing, organized a festival," says one of the organizers.
In the scene with the musicians, the Greek-Greek Anasthas prepares salads from the macaroni and home confectionery, and in the days there was a master class to prepare a boat with caramelized apples.

"The taste for restaurants can easily replace another forest fish from the Far East," says Philip Galkin, owner of his "People's" fish.
We've got the nerves, the tails, the tails, the tails, the tails, the king's hair.
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon because it's a wild fish.
The Norwegian forest is the same aquaculture.
You take him in your hand - he won't even get caught.
And you won't hold our East Forests in your hands.

In the spring his hat is a bed with a bunk "Magadan", a trish, anemone, a muxon, media with Crimea, a long way east.
Galkin's sure he's been fishing for a long time from the Far East.
According to statistics, the fisheries elections in Russia in 2013 were more than 4 million tonnes, a significant proportion of the fish in Japan, Korea, and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 - approximately 800 thousand tonnes.
The Lavka "His People" has been working since 2012, selling fish via the Internet store, and has served more than a dozen other restaurants, such as "Swift Things".
More than 15 other restaurants have now been applied to Galkina.
The same soup can be made from our fish, it's burning.
We sat down and tried different recipes.
Now we're selling garbage through the Internet for millions of rubles a month.
Our fish has flown several times, and the delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
In confirmation of Galkina, they're preparing me for Philly's bat with the cat.
Unlike the role of the seed, they have to live longer, but the knowledge that this fish is our father-in-law gives strength.
On the "His People" label, there's even roles from the palace and the sea oyster.
In the Sushi-bara, it is true that the Norwegian forest is preferred by the Chinese.
Galkin explains this because I'm going to break the line to think of new recipes from the far-east fish.
"The Russian fisheries suppliers have not yet offered us," explains Governor Killfish Bar Dmitry Evseev.
The same is true with other products: Russian producers could take the free product, but that is not the case.
According to the founder and owner of the LavkaLavka Boris Akimova project, imports from Europe and America from China, Israel and Latin America can now be mentioned earlier.
There are large transnational corporations with strong logic and large sizes.
They are able to replace the prohibited import quickly, unlike our farmers.
This is a ban on the benefit of major producers from other countries," says Akimov.
In addition, in the last month, the restaurant received a more alarming signal than the product sanctions.
As a result of the extensive in-depth audits, the Rospoufsvira was temporarily suspended from the activities of three McDonald's companies in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Ekaterinburg.
“We are studying the scope of the claims made to determine the action needed to speed up the opening of restaurants for visitors,” McDonald's press release said.
No one really understands what's going to happen.
If all are limited by the product sanctions, this is one option that can be overcome - a staff member who is engaged in a restaurant consultation is talking about the anonymity of the company.
If McDonald's were to be closed all over the country, the script would be all the others.
"Europrotocol" instead of GDPD claims
Cassation payments will be received without the exception of the GIBDD - so the CB intends to stimulate the implementation of the Euro-Protocol in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has drawn up a draft guidance that, as of 1 September of this year, a car-insuranced driver may be able to cover without a GIBDD charge.
The truth is, it's only about cases when an accident was formed on the "euro Protocol" without the involvement of the road police.
That is, if only two cars were involved in the DPRK, there were no physically injured persons, the damage did not exceed the limit set, and both drivers reached agreement on who was the victim of the accident.
Since 2 August, the Euro-Protocol payment limit is 50,000 rubs, and from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad areas, it will increase to 400 thousand rubs.
The fact is, often even in minor injuries, in situations where the TIR can be described as a "Europrotocol", drivers who have been hit by an accident are causing PDP.
However, it was not possible for the police to receive compensation without the release of the GIBDD.
The parameters described in the draft instruction, as well as the purpose of eliminating this obstacle to the implementation of the Euro-Protocol in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment of cash in respect of DTP, formed without GIBDD staff, should not be lower than the threshold for the "Europroto" protocol.
However, it cannot be the upper limit set by the casket insurance contract.
The idea is, without a doubt, useful and theoretically possible to unload both DPRK staff and roads.
But most of all, they don't come to the corner of the car, nor insurance.
The latter are now talking about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which may lead to the introduction of new rules on casket payment.
As for the leaders, it is difficult to imagine what work must be done to overcome the genuine Russian conservatism.
In most cases, the driver will wait for the inspector to report a small accident because it is more reliable.
And it is still unknown that it will be easier to defeat Muslims or convince leaders of the Euro-Protocol trust.
Keeping certificates are made anonymous and non-receiving
Minfin wants to prohibit the author's custody certificates, so it will allow banks to make an independent contribution.
Minfin is preparing a bill that prohibits the depositary certificates to the supplier.
In recent times, this instrument has gained popularity, both in terms of rates above and in terms of bank contributions.
The case is that the provider's deposit certificates do not fall into the deposit insurance system and the bank is covered by debt, as there is no need to calculate the Fund of the Investment Insurance Agency (ASA).
The gravity of the situation is that this step is intended to be taken by small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates and suffer from Sberbank and Bank Moscow, which, according to ASV, controls 98 per cent of the profile market.
The share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency, is approximately 3.5 per cent.
The problem is that clients of a small bank who buy such a certificate are trying to obtain a license in the event of receipt of a licence.
Some investors, without sufficient financial grammatical coverage and buying the supplier's storage certificates, may assume that their inputs are secured.
A reasonable lack of insurance payments on these certificates in the event of a bank's withdrawal of a licence may lead to a lack of understanding and social tension.
In practice, the agency had cases when the administering authority had tried to seek a safe return through the court,” they said in the ASW.
The problem, of course, is mental.
There will be no one to pay certificates to buyers, since they have no right to return from the State under the law.
If the instrument was not secured in the ASW, it would be prohibited, together with it, from the metal accounts on which citizens are included in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
These accounts also do not fall into the investment insurance system, but they are still in existence.
The fact is, most of all, that the certificates on the supplier are very valuable, which can actually be expressed as a cascade.
They are not actually transferred: any bank client can buy a certificate, pass a certificate to any citizen, and the number of owners can be changed until such a certificate is obtained.
In no case, the draft law stipulates that a storage certificate should be required to be named as a valuable book to be kept in a depositary.
Such certificates are permitted to be issued without the right to early retirement.
There is a comparison of a callless contribution that bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiffe

Germany will send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will send weapons to Iraq to combat the fighters from the terrorist group “Islamic State”, reporting on 31 August ITARA-TASS, referring to a decision taken following the meeting of the representatives of the FRG Government in head with Angelo Merkel Chancellor.
It is reported that Germany will send to Iraq 30 portable anti-tank rocket kits of Milan and 500 bags and 8,000 G3 and G36.
The submissions will be made by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate another 50 million euros to humanitarian aid to Iraq.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel would make a statement in the debate with the Government on the subject.
Until then, Germany has not put its weapons in "burning" points.
The views of the FRG population on the dispatch of arms to Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that it is only possible to stop fighters from the Islamic State, others fear that this weapon may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.

Two alliances met.
High-level negotiations in Minsk did not solve the problems that had been created but gave birth to a new format: the first members of the European Union met with the first people in the future of the European Union
Let the situation in the region of Ukraine not wait for delays, EU leaders and the Customs Union first discussed a number of "heat problems".
Whether such a structure is able to work effectively or not, so it is clear who has taken off this summit.
The issues were raised on the evening of 26 August, when the Belarusians, and then other Europeans with Europeans, were seen on the televisions of the new President Lukashenko.
Belarus's leader was an example of the opposite, a man who was just a jackpot, and was planning a decent age in the highest society.
As told by Maydan Lucasenko
The arrival of three major European Commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukaschenko and allowed him to make a final briefing on their behalf, not just the legitimization of the President with a 20-year term.
This is a request for the recognition of Minska as a full-time European political entity and as the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
The senior analysis of the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Studies, Dennis Melyanzov, is convinced that Brussels will no longer be able to speak with Minsk the same tone as before.
"The fact that Catherine Eston met a aunt with Lucaschenko gives the reason to believe that relations with the EU will be strained further," he said "The Fire."
There is a hidden part: training by the Belarusian authorities began long before Maydan in Kiev in November 2013.
"The results have been achieved and with the EU - successful visa facilitation negotiations and red tape, modernization dialogues - lists the "Fire", and international security negotiations have been held with the United States.
The United States even had a little sanctions.
With regard to Ukrainian events, Belarus's leadership had only slowed down the process.
Mensko, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - rather warm enough not to lose heavily in trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus to negotiate.
The other was a Belarusian leader who did not recognize the accession of Crimea to Russia and called for the punishment of the pro-prosessional militias in Donbass with all their might, and was not ashamed of Moscow.
Minsk was not from the Customs Union, nor from the ODKB, but in Baranovich, the Russian aircraft was located.
Brussels and Washington noted the balanced position of Minska on the Ukrainian issue - and assessed it by the Belarusian experts.
As Lukaschenko's movement towards political diversification has been successful, it will be seen that meetings in EU+TS are often to be held in the near future.
In the EU High Representative's office on foreign policy and diplomacy, Catherine Eston was unable to respond promptly to questions about what Brussels expects from relations in the new format.
The Secretary-General, Estonian Maya Kosyanč, simply stated that the issue was not a priority on the basis of the war and peace issues.
It was reported that the next meeting on the Ukrainian issue with the first persons in the new format could be held in Kazakhstan.
A statement made by President Nursultan Nazarbaeva, a young woman for Minska, which he acknowledged, appears to have been personally requested by the representatives of the European Union.
However, at the closing briefing, Alexander Lukaschenko realized that all sides did not object that Minsk would remain a central platform for meetings both in the form of Russia-OBSE-Ukraine and at the level of Heads of State and High Representative of the Eurocom Commission.
This means that "the last dictator of Europe" holds the status of a fully-armed European leader, who helps solve the global problem.
Best friend of the European Farmer
The composition of the EU delegation, including the Eurocommissions on Trade and Energy, has already led to the conclusion that the main sub-programme of the summit is, not the tragic situation of Donbass, but the economy.
In fact, the future negotiations on gas supplies and the overcoming of the concerns of the TS countries on the Ukraine Association Agreement with the EU are more comprehensive than the peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
Commissioner for Trade Carl De Guht, however, noted: "EU representatives have come to Minsk to seek a solution to the political crisis that has economic consequences rather than the opposite."
It seems, however, that in the economy the crisis in Ukraine "works" in Belarus.
Its consequences - and, firstly, the sanctions of the West and Russia - give Minsko, who is still suffering from the sanctions imposed on the manoeuvre.
According to the Director of the Mission's Research Centre, the former candidate in the Presidents of Belarus, Yaroslava Romanchuca, European investors are actively interested in Belarus's potential for supplying agricultural products to the RF in the field of sanctions.
The supply scheme for which Vladimir Putin was launched at Minsk's summits.
"Initiators of these schemes, the Romanian Fire" stressed, not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long developed supply schemes, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes have been destroyed.
Russia's business is urgently needed to restore them, even through the media of the Belarusian structures.
Second, the expert continues to be concerned that many Ukrainian companies have no longer established production in Belarus from the Ukrainian stock as well as the Russian market orientation.
In the Ukrainian producers, there are around $4 billion of exports to Russia, and the Belarusian production and marketing schemes can now be very expensive."
In the view of Romania, the role of the field economy in the EU and the TS negotiations is ideal for Luxembourg and in the development of economic ties with Europe.
He recalls that the EU agricultural sector's losses from Moscow's sanctions are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the European Commission has now offered only 125 million euros of compensation to farmers.
The President of Belarus may suggest that Brussels work together to minimize the impact of Euro-farms.
This may raise the authority of Lukaschenko in the EU to an unprecedented height.
Non-initiative hospitality
Catherine Eston thanked the Belarusian authorities for the summit initiative.
But the paradox is that official Minsk is opening up from its active role in the birth of the TS+EU format, while the Belarusian leader at a meeting with the Ukrainian colleague stressed that the new form was the initiativer and that Kiev was the whole.
"This was your proposal to gather without having to discuss, not with the boutiques, after the signing of the EU Association Treaty, in the situation in Ukraine at the time," he referred to Peter Poroshenko in front of the cameras.
In addition, observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, which, in the hearing, was significantly opposed to Minska's mediation, which greatly increased its political burden.
In the Belarusian Diplomatic Office, Belarus stresses that Belarus does not pursue useful objectives in organizing EU and TC operations on its ground, but that the ultimate aim is to establish a single economic space in the future from Lisbon to Vladivostok.
"It is absolutely in the spirit of the concepts that, in other areas, in particular in the field of security, promote and promote the leadership of our strategic Union, the Russian Federation," said the Fire in the Middle East, the agency where the words have recently been clustered together.
There may be areas with pay entrance in Moscow

To mention that some decisions have been made in this regard until early," Lixusu said.
Zammera stressed that for the capital authorities, the experience of Asian cities that resemble the structure and load of Moscow is very important.
One of the decisions taken from these countries was that the construction of the central railway was already being carried out by Lixusuto.
The recent construction of the Central Motorway is an example of the failure of all traffic through Moscow.
If there were enough traffic infrastructure, there was no need to have transit traffic in Moscow," he said.
Maxim Lixusuto also stated that the introduction of the flat-rolled parking lot had significantly broken down the capital streets.
And, he said, the capital authorities do not plan to stay on what they have achieved.
Remember, on 26 August, the Russian capital, Sergei Sobyanin, participated in a ceremony for the first launch of the Moscow Central Car Road (CCD) complex.
Shadow Mismatch
The film Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez "The City of Sins-2: The Woman to Kill" did not exactly the revolution that could have been expected of him.
The first “City of Sins” (2005), which was removed with a minimum but symbolic presence of Quentin Tarantino, has carried out a revolution in relations between cinema, comics and literature.
Sikvel is also more revolutionary: in the sense that it destroys the fundamental for modern thought of the "texis-antithesis-synthesis" (if understood under thesis of the universe, and under the antithesis of the cosmos).
From now on, it should read "thesis-antithesis-haos".
"The City of Sin-2" is also a hauttic and in the playwright, and at the philosophical level: he is both a haotish in a foolish sense.
Yes, part of the hero's brand on the first "Hord," though, here, Marv (Micky Rurk), will remember, he spent his life on an electric chair, and here, nothing, only succeeds - in the role of such a popular partner - from the air of a knife and other tanks with arrows.
But the old people literally break up with the stories of the news that hit the city from another film about the meaning and content of which viewers ask no question.
Yes, his story, which was badly equipped by the authors at the most interesting place, is in the superintendent of Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
She's got a hot-blooded Eve Lord (Eva Green) and something dark about her Duyt (Josh Brolin).
But this nonsense, in which Duyta, we say, does not stand out from Johnny -- more than people, like other parts of the body, suffer from unhindered regularity -- no pain, not even death.
They're not people, but we understand that they're zero architecture: a year-old cat, too confident in itself, a game that fits in the middle of the sex of detectives, corrupt senator.
Well, when the archaetype goes down with the archaetype and the archaetype, it's not a movie anymore, but you think it's an abstract book.
And it's just funny to ask an abstract biographies about the logic of the mixture.
And even in this vast world, there is something constant.
The first "Horda" battle shells continue to hold round protection from those who are trapped in their mother-in-law forces of darkness.
Yes, and the look of Detective Hartigan isn't, they're looking at the fire, and Bruce Willis's always nice to see.
The main problem of the City of Sin-2 is one.
Frank Miller was well aware that as a talented artist, he joined comics and zeros, and as a director, he turned the idea of how to transfer comics to the screen.
Comex and zero are two aggressively opposed "realities".
The phenomenon of comics was born at the end of the 1920s, when the Roman Dishil Hammeta "Creed of Blood" (1929), "Maltic School" (1930) and "Steklan Key" (1931) created a cannon of a snake, then called hard-boiled school - a hard-boiled school.
Well, pulp fiction.
The commissions gave Hollywood a lot of ten heroes: from the seabed of Popaya - a fire-firer that gives him the rich power, Superman, Batman and Sicar Dicka Tracy to Halka, Tora, Chelveka-pouka and other "motors".
But any film on the motives of comics was harmful: painted people did not want to handle the screen, remained in their surroundings with their wild, "real" world.
In other words, they were completely out of existence.
On the contrary, the most existential generation of world literature.
After World Wars, the traditional novel, with survival, character, family scandals and a historical background, lost all confidence.
What Forsaits, which Tybo and Rugon-Makkari, which are even the Bolconian and Rostovic ideas after Verden, the Osvencim and Hiroshima?
Such a novel was peaceful in the form of a fine opera, and the criminal was to define the marginal, the novel was elevated to the level of philosophy.
Hammett, on his skin, knew that he was working as a sanitator on the front.
He was a communist.
How, by the way, there were, at least, close to the company and columns such as the writers Horas Macko and Jim Thompson, directors of Jul Dassen, Joseph Louzie, Edward Dmitrick.
That's why the nuisance they gave to the archipelago, the first, the rough and the Chinese, and the second, is social.
It's an American choice of soccrealism.
The first "City of Sins" was remarkable because it was contrary to nature, but organically combined with a nuisance.
At first, the comic book came alive, not with its graphic nature, but with the "current" film.
The darkness of the selling world, where the cardinal ordered the murder, and the senator covered a wonderful son-in-law, was full of honor for Hammett.
And the vivid details of the kind of cut heads that the sadist deduces his nest, through the genius James Elroy, the author of the Black Orchid and the best - he's a declarely sweet-looking Neonura representative.
The City of Sin-2 is not even a departure, but the capitalization of the miller-Rodridges radical stylist before the tradition of comics.
Probably because of 3D technology.
When you look at the second Tower of Sin, you feel trapped in a glass layer inside which the snow melts the playing bell.
Besides, it's not much snow, it's blood clots, but what's the difference?
Let's talk about socialism and talk about something.
It is possible only when, wherever we may ever have, let it be on the face of a terrible plague, but there is a normal world where you can return a girl on the wrong path or say to the innocent parents that her loser is punished.
But when sin entered into the city, sin entered into the city, and the sin entered into it, and the law entered into that man's house.
It's as sweet as any rule.
Haos "The Tower of Sin-2" just jumped.
Justice for the fatherless child brought this immediate sin to a small, but cucumber.
The titres warn: there are harmful smoking scenes in the film.
As for the growth in the vegetarian episode in which man's fingers are broken, it gives him an admiral shock.
The hammeth would like.
French socialists must "stop and bring France into line," said key Unionman Fresua Olland.
Mr. Wall called on the deeply divided left forces to “provide a warm relationship” to the underprivileged president-social attack, which had not been approved by the overwhelming majority of the French people.
The President deserves respect for everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our debt--to stay with him," he said, calling out applause.
In a spirit of reconciliation, the Prime Minister was convinced that his Government would not raise the issue of a controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite the ongoing conflict of proposals, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister for Economic Affairs, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Olland urged his companions on the Socialist Party to remain “unit” with the Government.
However, Christian Tobera, the minister of justice, put the ball in the chair, came to the meeting of members of the Socialist Party, and criticized the Socialist Party for allowing the French to “lost faith in the future”.
Marin le Pé, the leader of the very right National Front, expressed his view of the ongoing internal conflicts among the socialists, saying that she did not think that the new Government of the Wall would last longer than a few months.
France Olland is the king's head, but Prince Manuel Wall is forced to collect a new government when the summer has not yet passed.
"And the new one doesn't stay awake or winter," said Mrs. Le Pen.
She repeated her call on the party to open the parliament, saying that she was convinced that the party could easily win early elections and be ready to run.
The ruling French party survived the March municipal elections, and the final right of the National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
The resurrected Journal du Dimanche found that 76 per cent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of surviving several opposing factions until the end of the presidential term of Mr. Holland in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a politician from the University of Sians Po, warned that the French would lose their patience if the new socialist government could not fix the economy and record unemployment.
"He has little time, but the public opinion needs to feel fast that something changes," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may get worse.
"The City Without Drugs" is out of demand.
The Swedish Arbitration Court has left without consideration of the request for the Regional Ministry for the Management of Housing to the Home Without Drugs Fund.
The building was intended to raise more than 7 million rubs to rent buildings in Ekaterinburg.
However, the defendant did not appear in court twice.
Today, the Court of Arbitration of the Sverdlov region has left without consideration of the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of State of the Region (MUGISO) to the Fund of the City of Drugs (one of the founders, Mr. Ekaterinburg Evgen Roseman).
The representatives of the regional authorities intended to raise 7.3 million rubs to rent buildings.
Today it has become known that the defendant has not appeared twice in court, for which it was decided to refuse the review.
Due to the lack of representatives of the MUGISO Directorate to explain, the Chief of the Legal Division, Maxim Titov, had not responded to telephone calls.
The Fund was also unable to communicate with representatives.
Remember, this is a special case that has taken place in the city centre on the streets of Berlin, 19 on an unprecedented basis since 2011.
Such a decision was taken by the former governor, Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of State of the Sverdlovsk State Property requested the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court to remove the building fund.
According to the request, the Office had been required by the court to recognize an open-ended treaty for the free use of a memorialary.
In the view of the MUGISO Directive, there were no significant conditions for the lease of cultural heritage.
The Swedish Arbitration Court rejected the search, and an appeal was filed in the 17th Arbitration Court, Permi, which was satisfied.
In the same court, the Fund filed a cassation appeal against this decision, which remained unsatisfied, after which the decision was appealed by the Fund in the Supreme Arbitration Court, but the court adopted the direction.
In 2013, a new lease agreement was concluded that the Fund was re-paying rent, which was told by the head of the city of Evgen Roseman.
The rent was set at 300 thousand rubs per month.
The previous administration of the area has given us this building for free use, recognizing our services in the fight against drugs, in a sign of respect for the Fund.
The current administration has decided differently," he said.
Tatyana Drogaeva, Ekaterinburg
Why Mr. Ekaterinburg was offered to leave voluntarily
On July 24th, Ekaterinburg's proud MP Alexander Kosincev proposed that the mayor of the city - the specicer of the pride of Evgya Royzman go away.
As a result, a criminal case was brought against a suspect who was arrested for murder by a retired member of the pride of Oleg China, whom the mayor considered to be a partner.
How Evgja Roizman was convicted
On 1 July, it was reported that a criminal case had been brought to light by the fact that "claws" (page 128.1 of the U.S. F.R.) in the Ekaterinburg blog of Ekaterinburg, Evgen Roseman.
This was reported in the GU IMD on the Sverdlov region, which addressed the relevant statement by Anna Filatov, Director of the Legal Centre for Protection.
In her statement, Mr. Roseman accused her in his blogs of being involved in crimes committed by her ex-husband.
Mr. Ekaterinburg is convinced that "it's a regular attempt to deny the truth."
iPhone is turning into a shell
Before 9 September, when Apple must submit its new drafts, all new runs of what can be expected from the presentation appear in the press.
With reference to American media sources, the sixth generation of iPhones will be equipped with mobile phones as a result of the joint Apple project and the Visa, MasterCard and American Express payment systems.
According to Bloomberg and the dedicated Re/code Internet resource, Apple can also announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express on 9 September on new products, resulting in a new iPhone 6 smartphone.
Companies themselves reject any comments in this regard.
This function enables you to pay for the store cassette with the help of a smartphone.
The identification of the payment will be carried out by the user using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will first set up NFC (ner field communication) technology, which will allow for an unconnected payment using the smartphone and the appropriate cassette device.
The NFC technology itself will be made available through a special microprocessor from the Dutch high tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
The first function of the NFC was also presented in 2004 in cooperation with Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that came into the so-called NFC Forum.
The first NFC phone was issued by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with the NFC - Samsung Nexus S - was submitted in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced Google Wallet to enable users to link bank cards to their Google account and pay with the Android smartphone.
In addition, American experts stress that, despite large investments by high-tech companies in the development of NFC technology, American producers are still careful about innovation and do not spend too much money on the equipment of their stores in such systems.
Therefore, observers now hope that Apple’s entry into this market will still require the producers to accelerate and more actively implement this technology in their trading points.

The Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise operator in the world, is at the conclusion of negotiations on the acquisition of a similar Prestige Cruises International Inc company of approximately $3 billion, according to reports from people who are aware of the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to luxury cruise ships and secured Prestige Cruises customers, as it competes with larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (CL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement may already be announced this week, the sources have been reported on Wednesday, warning that negotiations can still be broken.
Prestige Cruises, a private investment company, Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N.), also owns 20 per cent of Norwegian Cruise shares.
The sources have been asked to remain anonymous, as negotiations are not open.
The representatives of the Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the request to comment while the representative of Apollo refused to comment.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, manages 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.

The forward companies seek to position themselves as cross operators preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered in the United States governing bodies for the initial public placement of shares in January 2014.
Apollo became the principal shareholder of the company after the $850 million deal in 2007.

Activists of the Democratic Movement of Hong Kong cancel the statement by the Chinese representative the following day after the election decision
A group of citizens, loyal to Beijing, stood near the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the Assembly of Peoples of the Swiss Confederation on Wednesday established a procedure whereby two or three candidates would be allowed to participate in the elections of the Hong Kong leadership in 2017.
All candidates should begin to receive support from the majority of members of the Steering Committee, which is likely to be the end of the Japanese lobbyists.
The decision made almost impossible for the democratic opposition to the electoral bill and forced democratic activists to promise again to stop Hong Kong's financial centre by Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as China's party leaders fear that the call for democracy will be extended to other cities.
Following the publication of the Beijing document describing China's control over Hong Kong, in June, democratic activists held an informal referendum on elections in the special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands entered the city business centre and set up a standstill.
Brifing Li is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-President of the Standing Committee of the Assembly of the People ' s Assembly of the Czech Republic, Jong Rongson and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao State Council of Feng Wei, were also to be represented in the briefings series during the day.
Activists said they would meet at the head of the Government of Hong Kong on the second half of the day.
Britain did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last 150 years of its colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to join 400 grams of land belonging to the Palestinian Autonomy
The Israeli authorities declared their intention to join 400 hectares of land on the west bank of the Jordan River, belonging to the Palestinian Autonomy.
According to Bi-bi-si, the decision to join South Wi-Fi is related to the desire to pay for the theft and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
The Ministry of Defence declared the territory occupied by Israel on Wednesday and ordered the military to set up an administrative administration on the west coast.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip Siiba Arica, the world community should call upon Israel to respond to “continued sedentary activity in the West Bank of Jordan and in East Jerusalem”.
Putin calls for Kiev to start negotiations on "State" in eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports on his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for the Government of Ukraine to stop fighting with the separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately start negotiations on the “State” region.
His press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, explained later that Putin had no intention of indicating that the Eastern Ukrainian territory under the control of the separatists was part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needed to be revised to allow the Russian-speaking region to protect its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call on the Government of Kiev to start negotiations with the proselytizers as well as with the obvious strategy to be followed from the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: Help the separatists to remove the territory and force the Ukrainian Government to give the newly declared Newerosian territory the actual independence to approach Russia rather than the West.
During the State First TV channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the return of the detained separatists to the eastern Donec and Lugan areas, which were arrested in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian island of Kram 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the territories occupied by New Rossia, or New Russia, as a name that leads to the revolutionary days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believed that peaceful negotiations would take place in the near future when Ukrainian policies launched a campaign to parliamentary elections on 26 October and while government troops attacked peaceful settlements in the occupied separatist regions, the “illusia pillar” reported ITAR-TASS.
“We must immediately start substantive negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the political system of society and the state status of South-East Ukraine, in order to meet the interests of the people living there,” he said.
Peskov said that the words of Putin on Statehood were in the context of a broader autonomy, which had been discussed for months with the leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fear in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were at risk.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict”.
The involvement of the Secretary-General of Crimea to correct the word “unbelieving interpretation”, Putin stressed the decision of the Russian leadership to conduct itself on a separatist settlement in the east in a way different from the open occupation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million people are ethnically Russians.
Moscow would have to face a much more difficult battle to join even the Danube and the Lugan region of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants were non-Russian, and investigations had shown widespread support for the desire to remain within Ukraine before the start of the conflict.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats had discussed at international forums would give regional Governments in Ukraine the power to define trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, in fact, by transferring Cremulu to actual control over the territory that would combine Russia ' s main territory with the Crimea.
A major Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historical maritime corridors, is located on the Black Island, five months ago.
There are also shops, factories and lithium factories in the regions between the Russian Rostov region and Crimea, which produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Pedro Poroshenko proposed, during his inaugural speech on 7 June, that the Ukrainian legislators, following the new elections, should bring about amendments to the Constitution allowing regions to have greater control over their finances and the status of their languages.
However, his view of autonomy seems to differ greatly from the view of Kremlin and the Separacists, in the arms and in the attacks that have been accused of Moscow.
The last call for Putin to Kiev to deal with the separatists' leaders, as well, followed by the new arrivals of the rebels last week after the Russian army and tanks arrived in eastern Ukraine from the pre-peace area near the Asian Sea.
Russian-supported separatists took control of the city of Novoazovsk, where Ukrainian security officers said they were afraid that it was the beginning of a campaign to capture the strategic coastal territory before Crimea itself.
This has resulted in massive civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a port of steel with 500,000 inhabitants, which is between the Novosavsk and the narrow passage to the Crimean Peninsula.
On Saturday, the European Union leaders were gathered in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which was 23 years old.
"We're approaching the point of the storm," Poroschenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for a more serious sanctions against Russia to be taken in the event of a Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their positions in Ilovakia after two Russian bronchials and 1,000 soldiers had arrived last week in the Danube region to support the challenges of separatists, Colonel Andrey Lisenko, Secretary-General of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, reported to the reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were reportedly detained in Ilovakia as a result of the Russian invasion, were replaced by 10 Russian air carriers arrested in the Ukrainian territory last week, reported to Lisenko on Sunday.
The scandal with recorded photos captures Australia's fames and Gaby Greco
Jeffery Edelstein expressed his rejection of the hackers who may have stolen his young Gabi Greco and the whole list of Hollywood stars.
After several open photographs of Jennifer Laurences, Hollywood, appeared on the Internet as a result of a large hacker scandal.
It is said that the hacker responsible for this has about 60 open photos of the Golden Games star Lawrence and superstars, including Kate Apton and Kara Delevin's models, Rianna, Ariana Grande and Lia Michel and Kirsten Danst's actress.
Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Brahn, Ivonne Strawski and the resident in Melbourne, Greece, have also reportedly stolen photos as a result of the iCloud race.
The names of the names are listed in list 101.
Edelstein, who made a Greek proposal last month, said Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private records and photographs must be kept private.
It is terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greece, which is located in New York, said to the news website that the hacker attack was “slow” and that those to whom it was directed “feel that they have entered”.
It is assumed that the hacker has 30 photos of Palmer with an ex-Skot Spidman bifred, including two cadres, where it is located in a pregnant chest.
Palmer's work in the movie includes love and honor together with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the film "Chuck" Strawsky and the actress from the "Conventional Reception" Brown didn't comment on stolen photos yesterday.
The representative of Laurence said to TMZ: "It pushes private life."
Activist Seth Rogen expressed his disappointment at the hacker's address, writing on Twitter: "The fact is, it's nothing but the sale of stolen goods."
Just from a legal point of view, you can't tolerate the publication of stolen photographs.
A potential way to steal the photos of the entitled names
The mass loss of star accounts may be caused by vulnerability in the Find My Phone application.
The next Web resource was described by the potential development scenario.
The Github resource has been published in the Python language script, which has enabled you to obtain passwords for the Apple Find My Phone service.
This service allows you to track the iPhone location.
For access to it, the same connection is used for the Apple ID and that is for access to Apple iCloud cloud, from which there was a photograph of names.
The script allowed the test method to recognize the password from Find My Phone.
The method is consistent with the possible combination of symbols starting with the most frequently used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that the number of password options entered was unlimited in the Find My Phone service.
When the security system is properly organized after several failed attempts, the account must be blocked and the user informed of the damage attempt.
Because of vulnerability, users have not received any reports of an attempt to sign a password to their account.
hackers learned a password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to user Hackapp on Twitter, the vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and a script program was written to select passwords.
At this point the vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource was linked to user Hackapp and he noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability was of a nature for many services, but noted that there was no evidence that such vulnerability was used for access to the “star” account.
It's not me, plz RT
Foreign records have been issued by the Prime Minister on Twitter
Although there is no solid evidence that vulnerability was used for the purchase of photographs in the Find My Phone, it was already very harmful with the use of this service.
The hackers took over the management of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple stated that the cloud security had not been compromised, but had not conducted investigations into how users had lost their accounts.
In Russia the Prime Minister of RF Dmitria Medvedev was also injured earlier.
If the offenders had access to iCloud as described above, the password could be stored there for the account of the head of government in the microblogging service.
The Next Web resource failed to receive Apple's comments on vulnerability to Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to the Ukrainian Five Borough
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to the famous Ukrainian athlete Anne Burjak.
The relevant order is published on the Internet portal of legal information.
At the beginning of this year, the athlete moved to Russia to a permanent place of residence and called on the Federation of the Present Friday to allow her to speak for the RFF.
In 2013, she won two stages of peace, won a silver medal for a European champion in private, and became a champion of peace in mixed estaphet, which is one of the new types of sport.
It maintains leadership positions and in the current season.
In accordance with the rules of reference to the Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, it will need special permission from the Olympic Committee of Ukraine.
Anna Burjak is not the first Ukrainian athlete, changing citizenship.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to the Shachmatist Ekaterin Lagno, the levova champion of Europe (2005, 2008), the world close to 2010 and fast chess (2014).
Ukraine's Women's Team has become the winner of the Chess Olympics in Turin (2006), the World Championship in Astana (2013) and the European Championship in Warsaw (2013).
SCR terminated the investigation of the Tu-204 disaster in Vunkovo
The Russian Consequences Committee (CRC) terminated the criminal case in the event of the accident of the Tu-204 Red Wings aircraft.
The press office reports on this.
The decision was taken with regard to the death of the command of the aircraft and the shipowner.
The judicial experiment showed that the cause of the disaster had increased the rate of landing, the failure to meet standard landing procedures, and the unintended output of motors on increased straight-line traffic.
Aeroplane Tu-204 of Red Wings, following the Prague-Moscow flight, suffered a fall on 29 December 2012 when landing at the Moscow airport of Vnukovo.
The plane crashed across the airfield and burned.
On the scene, the commander of the aircraft, the second pilot and the shipowner were killed.
Two shipowners were sent to the medical facilities where they were subsequently removed from the injuries received.
Three other carriers who were hospitalized with severe physical injuries were treated long-term.
In addition, serious physical injuries were received by the driver of a vehicle moving at the time of the accident at the Kiev branch.
There were no passengers on the aircraft.
After the disaster, the Transport Office carried out a verification in Red Wings, during which numerous violations were detected.
In February 2013, the airline licence was suspended.
The company resumed its work in 2013.
Alexander Emelianko started training at the SIZO
A well-known Russian fighter of the 33-year-old mixed-style Alexander Emeliyanenko, who is in the SIZO on the accusation of sexual violence against the employer, has been fully relieved of the trauma and has begun training.
That's what the Championship reports.
In May of this year, the Russian Follow-up Committee charged Alexander Emelianco with rape.
The suspect was announced in search on 9 May, detained in Tambo after a road transport incident that resulted in a fatal accident.
Emelianko-young was arrested until 31 August and a sentence was issued on 1 September.
However, the court was transferred, and the result was an extension of the detention period until 30 September.
In the event that a sportsman's fault is proved, he will be sentenced to six years in prison.
What's up, brother?
"Lenta.ru" recalls the most scandalous stories in Alexander Emelianco's career.
His last one was Emeliyanenko in January of the current year, losing the technical scathing of Dmitrio Sosnovsky.
Alexander is the younger brother of the more famous fighter Fedora Emeliyanenko.
The latter is a four-fold World Championship on mixed war art, a four-fold World Championship, and a six-year-old Russian Olympic Championship.
The most universal and functional human emotion has been anger
A person's heart expression is biologically universal to humanity, and not everyone involved in its creation is a body and a group of muscles, but is an additional means of expressing power and threats, which has been explained by Australian and US scientists.
They told about their findings in Evolution and Human Behavior magazine and could read about them in the press release of the California University of Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of a person who is buried and buried beneath the graveyards of the mud line, the noses thrown out in all cultures, and makes him even blind from the birth of a child who has never seen him, is noted by the leading author of the study of Aaron Sel.
In the context of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have found that this emotion has created an effective response to conflicts during the conflict.
The more physical harm a person can cause to another, the more opportunity he has to dictate his circumstances, the more he will bring it to the offender with anger.
The researchers have also found another hypothesis: physically strong people are more concerned and more likely to be caught up in the practice, feel that they have the right to impose the conditions of others, and prefer the violent ways of resolving conflicts in peace.
Apart from the fact that anger is primarily a “trading emotion”, scientists have concluded that the movements of each of the seven groups of muscles that create a person’s heart condition should represent a more powerful and dangerous individual in the eyes of the opponent, and thus suggest how to respond as quickly as possible to his conditions in avoiding conflict.
To test this hypothesis, researchers modeled on the computer of the person where each of the seven elements of the person was present or missing and showed them to the informants.
Although the wounds or injuries that had been inflicted on individuals did not cause the person to act badly, the more powerful physical participants in the study recognized the person with such personality.
Man’s anger, as in animals, poses a threat: an overexpression of his own strength, which requires acceptance and submission.
A man spreads his noses and raises his lips for the same purpose as a lion that is expected, or a queen who demonstrates her feelings.
“Engagement is “empted” by the refusal of the partner to accept the situation, and the person immediately accepts a form that will demonstrate the most effectively contrary to the effect of the refusal.
But the difference is that not one of the components of the angry person is arbitrary, they all express the same thing," notes anthropologist John Tubi.
Minkomwis offered to allocate 250 million rubles to the Crimea Telecom.
Minkomazi was invited to allocate 250 million rubles from the federal budget to the independent non-profit organization "Cream " Telecommunications " in 2014.
This is discussed in the draft Government resolution prepared by the Government, with which Lenta.ru was introduced.
According to the explanatory note to the project, the federal budget grants will be directed “to cover the costs of creating conditions for the wide-ranging disclosure of the socio-economic situation and the development of modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crime, including the acquisition of equipment”.
In particular, it is intended to reassess the equipment-study block, the video, the central equipment and the video server.
It is also planned to acquire a mobile television station and satellite transmitter.
In addition, the company will pay for the use of the VOLS and the maintenance of the energy system.
Grants will be provided within the federal budget for Minkommunication.
The state television company Kerim was created in 1959 and is in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Russian, Russian, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
Today, more than 75 per cent of the territory of the peninsula is covered by a television signal.
In 2011, the "Cream" Telecom was licensed on television in digital format.
