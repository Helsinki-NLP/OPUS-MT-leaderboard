The rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronary infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and in Britain from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The cumulative disease of coronary infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and Great Britain, thus confirming that, despite the various stages of its development in various countries, COVID-19 pandemics are growing rapidly in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care offices, it is necessary to increase the level of preparedness for COVID-19 patients who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive therapy.
On 31 December 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology had been identified in the province of Hobbey, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the infected person is a new species of coronavirus, now known as a serious type 2 severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease called SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronary infection (COVID-19).
According to today's available data, approximately 80 per cent of COVID-19 people are affected by the disease in a light form, i.e. in the form of respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, while most patients are cured.
About 14 per cent of COVID-19 cases develops in a more severe form with the need for hospitalization, and in the rest 6 per cent accept a critical form when intensive therapy is required.
The mortality rate of patients treated with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
This study analyses the trends of COVID-19 cumulative disease in each European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (ECE) and Great Britain, and compares them with trends in the Chinese province of Hobbey.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 diseases in the EU/ECE and in Britain with data on Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/ECE and UK
After the outbreak in China, COVID-19 was spread to other countries, and currently, in the rest of the world, COVID-19 pandemic is developing according to the same dynamic as in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
Mr. Spitteri (Spiteri) and his colleagues reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 disease in Europe, which met the WHO criteria for disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/ECE were registered in France on 24 January 2020, all three patients returned from the province of Hobbey, China.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 infection have been identified in all 30 EU/ECE countries and in Britain, with 39,768 cases of infection and 1,727 deaths, including 1,441 deaths, from 31 December 2019 to that date.
Definition of cumulative quantity and cumulative disease COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates daily at 8:00 a.m. the number of registered cases in each country of the world from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of those countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data are used to analyse the trends of the spread of COVID-19 in the EU/ECE and in Britain and to compare them with the data on Italy.
As an indicator of the spread of active cases, COVID-19 has been estimated to be a reduced cumulative disease of COVID-19 in 14 days, taking into account the normal duration of COVID-19 in each EU/ECE country and Great Britain for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8:00 a.m. on 15 March 2020, compared with Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 Development Trends in EU/ECE countries and Britain
The trends in COVID-19 in the 14-day period in the EU/ECE countries and Great Britain were generally consistent with the trends observed in the province of Hobbey, China (see Figure 1).
COVID-19 cumulative disease in the EU/ECE and in Britain began to grow around 21 February, and a sharp drop of this indicator (additional material) occurred on 28 February 2020.
This was mainly due to an intense increase in the number of registered cases of disease in Italy, but similar trends were observed in all other EU/ECE countries and in Great Britain to increase COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 disease in EU/ECE countries and in Britain compared with the same indicator for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already registered at 8:00 a.m. in 15 other EU/ECE countries and in Britain is estimated to be approximately 3 weeks earlier in Italy.
Our results show the rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 registered cases in the EU/ECE and in Britain.
The observed trends in cumulative disease COVID-19 suggest that pandemics develop at a relatively rapid rate in all countries.
In spite of this, however, different stages in various countries, different responses from national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for the recognition of cases of disease and different patient selection rules for the analysis of the existence of COVID-19, including “inverse” testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10 per cent of COVID-19 patients require intensive therapy, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive treatment offices in these regions had already been completed.
Currently, only 6 % and 1 % of the cases (not reported) are available for patients with COVID-19 in the hospital and/or in the EU/EEC intensive therapy.
However, a systematic collection of such information is needed to complement the current monitoring data for which the number of recorded cases and the number of deaths are recorded.
According to a study conducted in 2010-2011, there is a significant breakdown in the number of cases in intensive care and intensive care offices in Europe: from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in 100 000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12,5 khocs in intensive care and intensive care offices for 100,000 people in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated ECDC report on the risk assessment results of COVID-19 provides a scenario for the modeling of health-care-care-based resources with estimated hospitalization data for infected COVID-19 in each EU/ECE country and in Great Britain where the risk of lack of coke in intensive therapy offices exceeds 90 per cent.
Since at this time cases are grouped across certain regions of the EU/ECE and Britain and hospitals and intensive therapy offices usually serve the population of a particular territorial group, information on the cases of infection and the number of ticks in intensive therapy offices is recommended to provide the territorial unit 2 units for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that COVID-19 pandemics are developing in the EU/ECE and Great Britain.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive therapy should be ready for the SARS-CoV-2, long-term non-degradable treatment scenario and for the increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who need medical assistance and, in particular, intensive therapy, for example, in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the last ECDC report on the results of the risk assessment, the high importance of preventing the spread of SARS-COV-2 is an operational, warning and integrated approach to the subsequent transition from minimizing effects, since, given the predicted rapid increase in the number of diseases in decision-making and patients, it may not be enough to think, adopt and adjust their responses accordingly if such measures are not taken earlier.
The report on the results of the risk assessment also lists measures in the field of public health to mitigate the impact of pandemics.
There is only a short period in which countries can intensify their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, in the coming days or weeks, health systems in other EU/ECE countries will be faced with the influence of patients who will need intensive therapy.
The outbreak of coronary infection in 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the serious type 2 serious respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (SARS-CoV-2) has become a human tragedy: more than 3,000 people have been killed in China and other countries of the world and over 80,000 have been infected.
Like SARS-CoV, which has caused the development of a severe respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from flies and produces similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and lower mortality than SARS, but it is much more infected and affects older people than young men and men more than women.
In response to the intense increase in the number of new disease publications, the article proposes an ongoing and comprehensive review of the rapid development of the study.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, ethology, viruses, diagnostics, treatment, predictation of further circulation and prevention of this disease.
Although answers to many questions are still to be found, we hope that this review will help to understand and eliminate the threat of disease.
The spring spring (China New Year), which fell on 25 January 2020, became an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese people who, in response to the outbreak of a new viral infection, urged to stay home for the whole holiday and for many weeks after it.
In view of the high level of coronavirus (CoV) caused by the outbreak of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) referred to this virus as SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020 and the associated disease as Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Huhan and spread rapidly throughout the country, and then nearly 50 other countries of the world.
More than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were identified on 2 March 2020, more than 40,000 patients were cured and more than 3,000 were killed.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “a long number for society” and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nij.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 publications on COVID-19 have appeared in less than two months, including articles on its virus, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, starting with the first report of 7 January 2020, which identified the follow-up of a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to combine the results of studies in the new and rapidly developing subject areas.
As far as possible, we are trying to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronary disease, the coroner virus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts of the prevention and forecasting of disease at the moment, as well as some other issues that are not less serious.
Coronaviruses were traditionally associated with pathogens that were not mortally dangerous to humans and mainly caused about 15 per cent of total respiratory diseases 4.
However, in this century, we have twice encountered high-patogenic human crown virus, with a serious severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and a nearby respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which caused the outbreak of diseases significantly in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and were soon spread to many other States with terrible levels of disease and mortality.
Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronary infection in the history of mankind.
As indicated in Figure 1.1, the report on the incidences of an unknown phenomenon first appeared in the National Commission for the Health of the CPR since 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first case of death was recorded in Mr. Khanh.
The epidemic then spread rapidly in neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it was known about the infection of workers, which provided for the possibility of human transmission of the virus.
On 23 January, the quarantine was introduced and the city's public transport was stopped.
On 24 January, according to the first clinical study, 21 out of 41 patients with confirmed coronary infection had direct contact with the marine product market in Hughan, which was considered to be the starting point of spreading infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the outbreak of coronavirus was a global emergency in the field of public health.
At the time of the preparation of the report, disease spread throughout China and has already spread to about 50 other countries throughout the world (see Figure 2).
In view of the rapid development of the situation, the final level and the level of emergency risk still need to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre clinical study involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented the following updated development picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHXa1qHA2bbbdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected all age groups, but mainly people between the ages of 30 and 65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years of age, very few of them were 20, and only 14 of them were still under 10 years of age.
Infection of SARS-CoV-2 among men above (0.31/100 000) than among women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 has been distributed by clusteres mainly in the province of Hobbey and in nearby regions.
In the mid-term COVID-19 symptoms were 5 (2-9) days prior to diagnosis.
The incubation period was on average 4.8 (3.0-7.2).
From the time of symptoms until death on average, there were 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The baseline production rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
As of 23 January 2020, there has been an exponential increase in the number of infected persons who, in time, have been driven by mass transport to celebrate the New Year of China.
The mortality rate among patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate among patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were gender (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a sub-family of major obese viruses that contain neither a specific RNA nor a specific RNA.
They can be divided into four types, namely alpha, beta, gamma and deltoids, of which alpha and beta-coronoviruses, as well as people, of course, are affected.
In the event of a recurrence of SARS and METS glucoproteins of schipolitic growth (S), the congenital receptors of type 2 angiotensin-transverting plant (ACE2) and dieptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) are associated with the cell receptors of type 2 (ACE2) and, accordingly, the membrain synthesis.
The cytoplasm is released by the gene of the viral RNA; after the replication of the viral gene, the gene RNC, together with the glucoproteins and nucleopagide proteins, generates the virus-containing vesicles that are then released from the membrane cell by releasing the virus.
The first gender sequence reports of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be a new type of betaconavirus, with 99.98 per cent corresponding to 10 consecutive samples collected in the first eye of the outbreak of the disease on the Huanan marine market in Hughan.
Genetic SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With the benefit of an electronic microscopy of the SARS-CoV-2 component, the ultrasonic human respiratory epithet was discovered.
It has been established that the ACE2 human plant is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, S-protein SARS-CoV-2 is associated with ACE2-manifer than in SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients less difficulty than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also generate an previously unknown short-term white coded orf3b and a secret white coded orf8.
The Orf3b virus virus SARS-CoV-2 may play some role in terms of the pathogenicity of the virus and increase IFNB's expression; however, the Orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, a collection of authors, together with Zhou (Zhou), submitted reports on the full-scale CCE2 structure of a human-size plant, with 2,9 Å in a B0AT1-consumer-consumer.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed condoms, collected as diameters and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S-proteins, which served as evidence of the identification and infection of coronavirus.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic mixture when performing a medical screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate holdings
It is known that both the source and the SARS-CoV, and the MERS-CoV, were the flies from which the virus was transmitted to humans through the tissues and ribs respectively.
By a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was established that the first SARS-CoV-2 holdings were flies, since the new virus was 96% identical to the SARS-CoV-2, namely the coronavirus of the SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown what kind of intermediate business has become, which has enabled the virus to overcome the type barrier and to affect the human being; the way of transfer is also to be clarified.
Mr. Zzi (Ji) and his colleagues suggested that the transmission of the virus from flying mice to humans became a snake in which a homologous recombination occurred in S-protein.
As a result of their study, Chinese researchers from Guangzhou suggested that pangolins, long-nosed milk that are consumed by mice, often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are potential intermediates SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99-percent genetic similarity between the pangoline virus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference in 1 per cent between the two genes is still very large, so it is considered that the final results have not yet been obtained with specific evidence (see section 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 in most are still unknown.
In laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may live within 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 40 to 50 % humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It is known that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and burning up to 56 °C in 30 minutes; effective blocking of the virus activity may be epher, 75 percent of ethyl alcohol, chlorine disinfecting agents, peroxidant acids, chloroforms and other esters, but not chlorohexidine.
Human populations in general do not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to a new virus.
There are currently no detailed studies on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coroner viruses, primarily SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (see section 4.4).
As a rule, the virus has begun to recognize the immune system that has fallen within the body of the holding, including C-type, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors.
By means of various mechanisms, the virus causes the expression of burning factors, the formation of dendritis cells and the synthesis of Type I interferons that inhibit the spread of the virus and speed up macrophages against virus antigens.
However, due to SARS-CoV, N-white, immune reactions can be avoided.
An adaptive immune response is soon included in the fight against virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in the protection of the body.
CD4+ cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and CD8+ cells directly kill infected cells.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help protect cells.
However, coronavirus may inhibit the T-cell function by causing their programmed death.
Domestic immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, also plays an important role in the fight against viral infection.
For example, the antibodies from the treatment patient were neutralized by MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the hyperactivity of the immune system would result in the local education of a large number of free radicals, which could result in serious harm to the light and other organs, and in the worst scenario it would lead to a polyurethane deficiency and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, for which there is a high likelihood that old people with congenital pathologies and pregnant women will be affected.
The risk of infection is higher for people who are affected by a large number of viruses or who have immunosuppression.
According to the study of the first 425 cases of infection in H. Hughan, the average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mainly from 3 to 7 days.
However, the study of 1,099 cases showed that the average period of incubation was 3 days, with the explosions ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A later described above study based on the demographic data of 8,866 cases showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the time limits for quarantine measures, taking into account the precise duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of infection to infected subjects in which the disease is spread unsympathetic.
The general practice became a 14-day quarantine for persons who had contact with the virus or infected virus.
Should the quarantine be extended until 24 days?
The main and primary symptoms of COVID-19 are often high temperatures, which may be the only occurrence or accompanying other symptoms, such as dry throat, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, headache, pain in the throat, itching, chest pain, diarrhoea, cough and rhyme.
In some patients a week after the beginning of the disease, spleen and/or hypoxia were observed.
In severe cases, the disease has progressed rapidly, and patients have developed severe respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with high temperature and/or symptoms of respiratory disease and severe leukaemia should check the virus for early diagnosis even if there is no pathology in the breast cell photos.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed the following symptoms prevalence rates: 98% high temperature, 76% dry cough, 55% dry and 3% diarrhoea; 8% of patients required an artificial ventilator.
Similar results have been obtained from two recent studies of family injury and the transmission of virus from non-sympathetic infections.
Similar results were obtained in 2012 in studies of patients with MERS-CoV, with major symptoms also high temperatures (98 per cent), dry cough (47 per cent) and dryness (55 per cent).
However, 80 per cent of them required an artificial ventilator, which is much higher than among patients with COVID-19 and corresponds to a higher mortality rate than MERS than COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also experienced diarrhoea (26 per cent) and pain in the throat (21 per cent).
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high temperatures (99–100 per cent), dry cough (29–75 per cent), nausea (40–42 per cent), diarrhoea (20–25 per cent) and pain in the throat (13-25 per cent), and artificial ventilation is required for 14–20 per cent of patients.
On 14 February, deaths from COVID-19 were 2 per cent, and the world's total number of confirmed cases reached 66,576.
In comparison, the mortality rate from SARS to November 2002 was 10 per cent of 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed a death rate of 37 per cent of 2,494 confirmed cases.
As a result of the earlier study, the baseline product (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at level 6.47 at 95% confidence interval (CI) within 5.71-7.23 while R0 for SARS-CoV was in range only from 2 to 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV on symptoms, mortality level and R0 is shown in Table 1.1.
The above indicators show a higher capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to be distributed compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate in the case of a new virus lower than the latter.
Therefore, keeping the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will be much harder than the MERCS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The classic event often takes place within one family or group of people gathered together for any reason or occurred together on a transport, such as a cruise line.
Patients often traveled to Hughan or other affected regions, lived there or contacted infected or sick during the last two weeks before the outbreak of the disease.
However, according to the data provided, people may be infected without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and treated patients from the hospital may re-enter the virus, and this is a alarming signal for the extension of the quarantine period.
In early stages, patients had normal or low leicocyte counts (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 had lymphomas with leicocytes < 4×109/L, including leicocytes < 1×109/L, and increased asparagin aminotransferase and virus levels.
In some patients, elevated levels of bees, muscle enzymes and myoglobin have been found in the blood, and in most patients, elevated levels of C-reactive white and urethrocytes have been observed.
In patients with severe D-Dimer disease, the fibrine drop product present in the blood has been increased and the number of lymphocytes has steadily decreased.
In most patients with COVID-19, pathology was detected in the X-ray study of the breast cell, characterized by uneven darkness with both sides or cloudy cloud types of “mastic glass” in light.
Patients often develop typical pneumonia, severe pain and severe respiratory disease (ORD).
In the development of the ODA, uncontrolled burning, fluid loss and progressive fibrosis have led to significant damage to the gas supply.
The dysfunction of type I and II tyres reduces the level of surface-active compounds and increases the surface load, thus reducing the ability of the light to increase and increase the risk of light drop.
Thus, the worst results of the X-ray study are often the most serious cases of disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the depletion of pneumonia, the formation of hyalinous membranes and intermittent lymphocyte infiltration, and multi-synthetic cells in patients who died from disease, according to pathology of viral infection and OCR and similar findings in patients with SARS and MERS.
As the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19, RNC SARS-CoV-2 was used by a polymeric core reaction with reverse transcriptase (PCR with reverse transcriptase).
However, given the high level of false-progressive results that could accelerate the pace of epidemic development, from 13 February 2020 in China, diagnosis was started on the basis of clinical manifestations (not relying solely on the CPC with reverse transcriptase).
The situation was similar to the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, it is critical that the history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and the results of the X-ray study should be compiled to ensure effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Group of Experts under the direction of Mr. Feng Zhang described the protocol for the application of the SERLOCK methodology based on CRISPR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2; this methodology allows the detection of synthetic RNCS SARS-CoV-2 fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/l up to 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10–100 copies per microlitre of the original sample) with the aid of indicators less than without the use of the complex equipment.
This new methodology, if it is successful in checking clinical products, can significantly improve the sensitivity of the tests and their performance.
Because of the lack of experience in the treatment of an unknown coronary virus, doctors may primarily provide patients with COVID-19 with only supportive therapy, while trying to apply any therapeutic methods used or proposed in the treatment of other coronary viruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2.2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of healthy patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was suggested that even plasma should be used for treatment in healthy patients.
The pharmaceutical companies will attempt to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
At the initial stages, SARS-CoV-2 is primarily easily attacked and may be less likely to attack other ACE2-expressive organs, such as ice-cream and dust.
Nevertheless, the violation of the work and rejection of the respiratory organs are the main threat and cause of the death of patients.
Thus, support for respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high levels of oxygen concentration, invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, which are intended to be linked to the burden of disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extra-corresponding membrane oxidation (ECMO), modified method of extrapulmonary blood treatment used to treat a life-threatening risk of heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, the main concern for patients with SARS-CoV-2 is the maintenance of aqueous balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as the protection of vital organs.
It is known that cytokine fever is the result of hyper reaction to the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine storm is a form of a system fueling process that develops in response to a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IFN, IFNB, IFNG and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immunities in the emission of large amounts of free radicals, which are the main cause of the development of the ODA and the polyurethane deficiency.
In the treatment of cytokine fever, particularly in patients with severe conditions, immunity is of primary importance.
For the treatment of cytokine fever, corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monoclonal antibodies served as an interleicin-6 inhibitor were used.
Other methods of treatment of cytokine heat based on immune pressure include the modulation of immune response to T-cell control; the blockade of the production of cytokines IFN-g, IL-1, and TNF; yanus-quinase pressure; the use of blinatomab, cytokine signals 4 and hystondeacetalas inhibitors.
In order to reduce the severity of the effects of explosives on the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as immunity providers.
However, steroids in large doses do not benefit from the treatment of severe injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially osteoporosis, which significantly undermine forecasts.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium doses are recommended with caution in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in critical conditions.
No effective anti-virus therapy was confirmed at the time of the preparation of this document.
However, the internal introduction of rhedesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was an effective treatment of an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a recently developed antiviral preparation originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
The latter, however, demonstrated the possibility of transmission of other viruses from the same start-up RNA, including MERS and SARS.
Based on these data, the Gilead company has provided China with this medicinal product to conduct male studies in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are expected to be long-term.
In addition, baricitinib, a-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been proposed as possible options for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhoea, cough, vomiting, vomiting and other side effects.
Caution should be exercised to monitor the interaction of these medicinal products with other medicinal products designated by patients.
The plasma of healthy patients and the development of an antithesis
The collection of blood in patients treated with infectious diseases has been used for a long time to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect the health of the population.
In fact, the blood of healthy patients often contains a relatively high number of antibodies to fight pathogens.
The antibodies are in immunoglobulins produced by B-limfocites to fight pathogens and other innovative objects; they recognize individual pathogens molecules and neutralize them directly.
Based on this premise, plasma was administered from the blood samples of the COVID-19 group of patients treated with COVID, which then placed 10 heavy patients.
Over 24 hours, their symptoms improved, increased the intensity of burning and viral load, and increased the flow of blood oxygen.
However, in order to propose a mass application of this method before the specific therapy is carried out, it is required that no checks and explanations be made.
In addition, some plasma-related deficiencies should be carefully studied, taking into account the therapeutic effect.
For example, antibodies may stimulate the immune system too much and cause cytokine emissions syndrome, which, taking into account toxicity, poses a potentially life-threatening threat.
The incidence of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the plasma to treat patients in critical conditions is very low.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat the global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and practical to assign B-cells to healthy patients and define the genetic code of active antibodies or to use a screening to find active antibodies to critically important whites of the virus.
That's how we can move to the mass production of an antithesis immediately.
For thousands of years, Chinese people have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends largely on the combination of many components of the formula, which differs from the diagnosis of disease based on Chinese traditional medicine theory.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or have inexhaustible activity, as it is difficult to assign and verify these components or their optimal combination.
In the current absence of effective specific therapy COVID-19, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative methods for treating patients with mild and moderate severity of symptoms or for patients who develop after a severe stage of illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were recognised to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The largest proportion of patients with COVID-19 have been reported in a number of Chinese provinces, where 87 per cent of Chinese traditional medicine was used in treatment, including in Ghana (63.7 per cent), Nina (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while in the province of Hobby, where Chinese traditional medicine was used only about 30% of patients with COVID-19, the lowest percentage of patients (13 per cent).
However, this is a rather serious comparison, since the evaluation should take into account many other factors of impact, such as the number of patients and the severity of their disease.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang (Boli Zhang) and his colleagues published research materials that compared treatment exclusively to Western medicine and combined treatment in Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the normalization of body temperature, the elimination of symptoms and the provision of medical assistance under the station was less felt in patients treated with a combination of methods of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in patients treated only by Western methodologies.
The most surprising is the fact that the proportion of patients who began to suffer from symptomatic (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the group treated by combining methods of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in the group treated only by Western methodologies (7.4 per cent compared to 46.2 per cent), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8 per cent compared to 39 per cent).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more closely controlled studies conducted on a larger scale and in a larger number of regions.
A particular interest is also to obtain, where possible, a mechanism of action and to explain the effectiveness aspects of the components used in Chinese traditional medicine methodologies or their combination.
Patients who suspect or confirm the existence of COVID-19 are primarily under severe and even fatal conditions, while people who are confined to quarantine also experience shock, loneliness and extreme shock.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as lichorrhea, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects such as corticosteroids, may cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
Early stages of the outbreak of the disease caused by SARS have been reported with a number of psychiatric diseases, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotological alertness, psychotic symptoms, deliries, and even suicidal behavior.
Compulsory monitoring of contacts and quarantines, including measures taken by health authorities to prevent the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase people's concern and sense of guilt related to the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric assistance should be provided to patients with COVID-19, suspects and contacts with them, as well as to all the other people it requires.
In the context of psychological support, multi-professional psychiatry brigades should be developed, clear and accurate information on SARS-CoV-2 epidemics and treatment plans and use electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in stopping the cycle of transmission from infected animals and infected people to susceptible holdings and are often used in addition to antiviral therapy used to prevent outbreaks caused by new viruses.
Work has been undertaken to create vaccines based on S-protein, with the aim of producing long-term and high-acting neutralising antibodies and/or protection immunity to SARS-CoV.
In animal studies, live weakened infections from SARS virus have been developed.
However, prior to the initiation of clinical studies, the effectiveness of these potential vaccines should be determined in a natural way when used in adult patients, the model of maternal infection and the degree of protection from zone virus infection.
Perhaps the reason is that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and since then it has not been reported any new case.
At the same time, there continue to be cases and categories of diseases caused by the MERS virus born in the Middle East and spread in other regions thanks to the conservation of ozone sources in the area of endemic habitats.
In order to combat MERS, vaccination strategies have been developed with the use of an inactivated virus, DNA plasma, viral vectors, nanons, virus-like particles and components of recombinant proteins, and some of these strategies have been evaluated on animals.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for persons who do not have immunity is an urgent and critical task that requires a solution to prevent an epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long-term (mean 18 months) required for the development of vaccines and the dynamic visualization of coral viruses.
In the absence of an unknown disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show a full picture of the clinical duration of the disease by thousands of patients.
In most cases patients can be gradually cured without any difficulty.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with high frequency of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
In this regard, it is critical for health authorities to draw up a prognosis model to determine the priority of the measures they have taken, especially in areas where resources are inadequate.
Based on clinical data submitted at the time, the following factors may affect the forecasting of disease in patients with or related to COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the disease caused by SARS virus, which was also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 is mainly affected by patients aged 30 to 65, 47.7% of whom are over 50 years of age, according to the above study, 8866 cases.
In patients who required intensive therapy, the incidence of underlying diseases and complications was considerably higher than those who did not require such treatment (mean 66 versus 51 years), which showed that age was a progenitor factor for patients with COVID-19.
Paul: Infection of SARS-CoV-2 among men above women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Disease and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive therapy are more likely to develop acute myocardial infarction and arrhythmia.
Cardiological events were also the main cause of the death of patients with SARS.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 could also be associated with ACE2-positive Holangiocytes, which could lead to a breach of pay in patients with COVID-19.
It is noted that age and underlying diseases are closely interrelated and can distort results.
Reactions found in laboratory studies: C-reactive white blood levels reflect the severity of the burning process or tissue injury and are proposed to be considered as a potential prognosis factor, treatment response and final treatment.
It was also proposed to take into account the relationship between the C-reactive protein level, the severity of disease and the forecasting of COVID-19.
In addition, the results can also be expected to increase lacticadehydrogenase, asparagin aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and creatinine.
These plants are widely distributed by various bodies, especially the heart and the liver, and their emissions are caused by tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of heart or print function.
The main clinical symptoms: data should be taken into account for predicting results and difficulties in the treatment of COVID-19, along with other factors, in the X-ray study of breast cells and in the development of clinical symptoms over time.
The use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immunizers widely used in infectious diseases as additional therapy to reduce the severity of the burning process.
Since the use of corticosteroids has been widely used to treat patients with severe SARS forms, many of the survivors have developed osteoporosis, resulting in life-threatening disability and low quality of life.
Therefore, when needed for the use of steroids to treat patients with COVID-19, these preparations should be prescribed in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: as described above, many patients suffer from unforeseen stress, as they often have long periods of quarantine, high levels of uncertainty, and monitor the death of their relatives and other patients.
In order to reduce stress in such patients and to help them return to normal life, psychological advice and long-term support must be provided.
According to the present demographic studies, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to the low respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as other coronary viruses that cause ordinary respiratory diseases, may be successfully multiplied in upper respiratory tract and cause weak symptoms or not to cause symptoms at the early stage of infection.
For this reason, patients who have suffered from a disease or who have not completed an incubation period may be able to spread the virus to a large extent, which is a major challenge for epidemiological control.
It was, however, believed that the transfer of SARS-CoV virus occurred when patients were seriously ill, while in most cases it was not in the early stages of infection.
Thus, the present COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it is more difficult to control.
There is now a great work in China, which has been announced by the general quarantine in Hughan and neighbouring cities, as well as the quarantine regime has been extended practically to the entire population, which has been introduced to halt the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
While these measures have a significant impact on the economy and other areas of the country's life, the number of new patients identified has been reduced, which refers to slowing down the rates of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March, and the rate of inflammation will be 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter (Paul Hunter) and his colleagues thought that the outbreak of COVID-19, which seemed much more vulnerable than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from the group headed by Ira Longini (Ira Longini) set up a model to predict the end of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could defeat two thirds of the world's population.
The Panel of Canadian Specialists reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in the nose and throats taken in patients who had recovered and died two weeks earlier, indicating that a new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to a flu.
However, the reduction in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that the current strategy may have had an impact.
According to the initial estimates, Ebola’s leukor had to be beaten to a million people and killed by a half a million patients.
But with strict quarantine and disease isolation at the end of the end, it was possible to take control.
It is likely that, like SARS-CoV virus, the infection capacity of SARS-CoV-2 may weaken and, over time, it will disappear or become less pathogenic in humans.
The comparison of COVID-19 epidemics with SARS and MERS epidemics (ris. 55) is shown below.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through cough or shingle, and possibly through direct contact with the materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also detected in the circle, which meant that it could also be an oral method of transfer.
According to one of the most recent studies, 41 per cent of 138 patients were probably infected in the hospital, including 17 patients with other diseases identified earlier and 40 patients.
Thus, serious precautions should be taken to protect the population, particularly health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even those outside the community that contact patients or infected.
The first line of defense to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of masks for the person; and surgical masks and N95 respirators (Section No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
The surgical masks do not allow fluids from potentially infected people to fly into the air and sit on the surfaces from which they can be transferred to the environment.
However, only Class N95 (Serial No. 1860s) masks can protect against the breathing of viruses of 10 to 80 nm, leaving only 5 per cent of viruses; SARS-CoV-2 virus of the same size as SARS-CoV, and both of which are approximately 85 nm.
Since the particles can detect even five surgical masks, combined with medical personnel, directly contacting patients, it is mandatory to carry N95 masks (series No. 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to the mask, medical personnel should wear a protective helmet on the figure in order to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also fall into the body through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, the doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing a Class N95 mask; the virus may have fallen into his body through the burning eyes.
Medical personnel should therefore also wear transparent facial scars or protective glasses of a closed type.
All populations in affected or potentially threatened regions are urged to wash their hands more often by disinfecting drugs, to try not to leave home by self-sustainment, and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
The acceptable distance to the patient is estimated to be approximately a meter.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus had not previously been identified to humanity, its high level of similarity to SARS-CoV reported on 7 January 2020 should have been a disturbing signal for China, taking into account the experience they acquired during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, only after 19 January 2020, the Director of the Center for Disease Control, Hughan, calmed the citizens, reported that the new virus had low contaminants and limited reproductive toxicity when transferring from human to human beings and that prevention and control of disease would not be a problem.
This statement has significantly reduced social tension, particularly during the period when all countries were preparing for the New Year's celebration, and was given critical time when the disease could be kept within Mr. Hughanh with minimal losses.
The health authorities of China can take this serious lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more public statements as each word is taken into account and may affect their relationship and decisions; (2) monitor and respond to unusual information coming from the clinic rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and workers; (3) take more decisive measures to prevent the potential epidemic at early stages of its development than to discourage the public; and (4) more targeted and effective education to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and regular checks and improvements of society's response systems.
The outbreak of COVID-19, caused by an previously unexplained coroner virus of heavy type II respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), began at the end of December 2019.
More than two months of disease covered all of China, and at the time the document was made available in 50 countries of the world.
Since the virus is very similar to the coronavirus of a severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to symptoms of a severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), COVID-19 has had a feeling of relapse.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important in terms of the prevention of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than youth and men more than women; the proportion of cases and mortality among older people is also higher than among young people.
Deaths resulting from SARS were higher than in COVID-19 (10.91 per cent compared to 1.44 per cent).
Patients with COVID-19 are spreading the virus even when the disease is unsympathetic, whereas patients with SARS are usually affected by the environment only in cases of serious disease, so it is more difficult to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 is widely distributed faster and larger than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative conventional tests with SARS-CoV-2.
On the other hand, patients treated may again show positive samples of the virus.
All of this significantly increases the risk of virus spread.
As a result of such rapid progress, COVID-19 still remains some important issues, i.e.:
What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of 96 per cent noise between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronaviruses, we cannot yet claim that SARS-CoV-2 infection was caused by flies.
What has become an intermediate form of transmission of the virus from the original holding, such as flying mice, to man?
Without the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot safely stop the transmission process, and the epidemiological situation can be compounded at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is related to ACE2, but how is the virus introduced into respiratory cells and causes subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also associated with the ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot ensure the rapid and precise determination of diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic take?
How does the virus genetically evolve in human transfer?
Will it be the cause of the global pandemic, will it also disappear like SARS or will it reociliate periodically like a flu?
These aspects are of primary importance, but time will be needed to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.
Aeronautics of human crown viruses
Motivation and adaptation have stimulated the evolution of coronavirus (CoV) and their carriers, including people, for thousands of years.
By 2003 it was known that two human crown viruses (HCOVs) were causing a mild disease, such as a common cold.
The outbreaks of a severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our view of how catastrophic and life-threatening can be a human coronary virus.
At the end of 2019, the occurrence of a serious type of respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in central China has refocused on coronary viruses and has struck us with a high prevalence but a weaker pathogenicity of this virus compared to the SARS-CoV virus.
Coronavirus infection is a zone, and the understanding of its zone origin will be very useful.
Most human coral viruses come from flying mice for which they are not pathogens.
Intermediate reservoirs of certain human crown viruses are also known.
The definition of animals directly affects the prevention of human diseases.
The study of the interaction of animals carrying coronaviruses can also shed light on the pathogens of coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we present available data on seven human crown viruses, focusing on the history of their discovery, as well as their geographical origin and intermediation.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing various human crown viruses from the point of view of virus evolution and genetic recombination.
In this context, the present disease epidemic caused by the crown virus detected in 2019 (COVID-19) is also addressed in this context.
In addition, the conditions needed for the successful exchange of carriers and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are noted.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of obese viruses with one positive polyarthritis RNA.
These viruses, with the largest of RNC-containing viruses, have been identified from 26 to 32 thousand nucleotides, thanks to its form, which reminds the region of the region when it is considered by the microscopic.
From the perspective of the structure, coral viruses contain unsembled genes from the identical organization.
About two thirds of the genes contain two large, partially-open, cross-recombined (ORF1a and ORF1b), translucent to polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins marked by nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains an open range of calculations for structured proteins, including symphony (S), lipid protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Other lines of coronavirus also contain a number of linear accessory whites.
Based on differences in the sequences of the white\ coronaviruses, four species (alfa, beta, gamma, and deltacoviruses) are included in most human coronaviruses and are divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There are philogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha and betaconaviruses is the fluid of mice and gratis, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma and deltaconavirus.
For thousands of years, coroner viruses have been constantly overcome by intermediate barriers, and some of them have evolved into dangerous pathogens.
Today, seven human crown viruses are known.
These include HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The remaining five betaconanoviruses include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Coronavirus of heavy respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Coronavirus of heavy heavy respiratory syndrome of the second type SARS-CoV-2 type.
Human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually present symptoms of mild form, e.g. shortness and/or diarrhoea.
Unlike them, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV viruses and recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogens, causing severe low respiratory infections compared to a higher number of patients with higher risk of developing acute respiratory disease (ORD) and external symptoms.
The first or the human coronavirus HCoV-229E, B814, was obtained from a sample of the perforated patients in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive studies have collected more detailed knowledge of HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 viruses that cause local infection.
Indeed, prior to the outbreak of a severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a general concept that the infection of the human crown virus was considered to be totally worthless.
The outbreak of SARS in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in current history; more than 8,000 people were injured, and the overall mortality rate was about 10 per cent.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a long epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease spreading slowly in the rest of the world.
The new human crown virus (2019-nCoV) discovered in 2019, subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, was the cause of the current epidemic of coronary infection in 2019 (COVID-19), which, as of 3 March 2020, had more than 3,120 lives and more than 91,000 people had been infected.
The alarm signal has been received, and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human crown viruses have a zone origin, and their sources are flies of mice, mice, or domestic animals.
Many data sets testify to the evolutional nature of all human coral viruses from flying mice that have been well adapted to organisms in which they do not display pathogens but demonstrate a broad genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has exposed China and the world to serious medical, scientific, social and moral challenges.
The study of the zone mechanism for human crown viruses will allow them to understand their natural history, the forces of their evolution and the factors that limit intermodal transmission.
It may also indicate or accelerate the search for a reservoir, intermediate and amplifier SARS-CoV-2, which is very important to prevent the spread of disease in the future.
This review provides general information on the origin of the zone, inter-mediation and pathogens of human crown viruses.
In particular, we note and consider the following common feature: the original viruses from which human coral viruses are usually not pathogenic to their reservoirs, but are acquired pathogens after intermediation to the new carrier.
We are also analyzing the trend towards the evolution of human crown viruses, which often leads to the weakening of the pathogens.
The same context is also considered as a result of the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 HCoV-229E strain was first obtained from a sample of patients with mild disease, various coronaviruses were found in various infected animals, including pigs, pigs, pigs, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human crown viruses have been identified in recent decades.
Table 1 presents a brief history of the detection of human crown viruses in chronological order.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was obtained from tests taken from the respiratory tract of patients with the infection of upper respiratory tract in 1966; the virus was further adapted to the proliferation of WI-38 blood cells.
In patients infected with HCoV-229E, mild symptoms, including headache, nausea, general discomfort and pain in the throat, were observed in 10 to 20 per cent of cases of high temperature and cough.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was removed from the organic culture and the subsequent series of passports into the brain of mice.
Clinical signs of infection with HCoV-OC43 are similar signs of infection with HCoV-229E, symptoms that are not different from other pathogens of respiratory tract infections such as A influenza virus and rinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have a global spread in the world and, generally, are transferred in winter to moderate sizes.
During the main incubation period, these two viruses will last for less than a week and will have approximately two weeks of illness.
According to the study of volunteers, normal simplicity has been developed in healthy people infected with HCoV-229E.
Only a few patients with weakened immunity experienced severe low respiratory infections.
The outbreak of SARS, also known as “atypical pneumonia epidemic”, was the first in all history of mankind to be well documented pandemics caused by human corn virus, and the outbreak of the disease was the virus SARS-CoV, the third of the identified human crown viruses.
The first case of SARS disease was found at the end of 2002 in the Chinese province of Guangdong.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases of disease and 774 deaths were documented and disease spread in many countries and on various continents.
Without regard to the overactive distributors, it was considered that each patient could affect about two more people; the incubation period was between 4 and 7 days, and the virus load was 10 percent of the disease.
In patients infected with SARS-CoV, pain in the muscles, headaches, high temperature, general lack of support and symptoms, and later symptoms include pain, cough and respiratory failure.
The spread of laboratory deviations from the norm in SARS is lymphopy, in print tests and the increased level of creatinine.
Patients with SARS are also monitored for the diffusion of alveoliar injury, the proliferation of epithelial cells and the increase in macrophages.
Approximately 20-30 per cent of patients are subsequently required in intensive therapy and mechanical ventilation.
In such severe cases, in addition to low respiratory tract infections, other organs, including the bodies of the cold, cold and cold trachea, can usually be infected with cytokine fever, which may be fatal, especially for patients with reduced immunity.
The first virus was released from an open biopsy of the mild relatives of the patient who arrived in Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to study human crown viruses.
At the end of 2004, HCoV-NL63 was assigned to a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
It was first established that it was mainly affecting young children, elderly people and patients with impaired immunity and respiratory diseases.
For HCoV-NL63 diseases, symptoms such as nausea, conjunctivitis, high temperature and bronchialitis are present.
A second independent study described the same virus from the nasal material taken by an 8-month-old boy from the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
The virus was detected in the Netherlands, but in fact it was spread everywhere.
According to estimates, HCoV-NL63 is the cause of approximately 4.7 per cent of widespread respiratory diseases, and the outbreaks of the disease occur at the beginning of summer, summer and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is related to the design laryngitis, which is also called the mass.
HCoV-HKU1 was assigned to Hong Kong in the same year from 71-year-old men treated with pneumonia and bronchialitis.
In addition to extraboldial pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is associated with the spread of asthma.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 virus, causing respiratory diseases in a light form, have been found worldwide.
All of these four human coronary infections have been well adapted to people and their mutations, leading to highly pathogenic diseases, usually minor, although their causes have not been known, as often as with a more viral subtype HCoV-NL63, which, according to recent reports, has caused serious infections of low respiratory tract infections in China.
Usually, the acquired capacity to effectively transfer and remain in the human body is reduced by the virus or pathogens.
Coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first assigned in 2012 to Saudi Arabia from a 60-year-old patient with severe pneumonia and initial insufficiency.
Most of the laboratory confirmed cases were located in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia, cases of detention and distribution were recorded through epidemiological second-party infections in close contact.
Another second outbreak of 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
Clinical manifestations of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) call to mind the symptoms of the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) — a progressive acute pneumonia for both infections.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed a serious initial deficiency, which, in the meantime, is different from the remaining diseases caused by human-transmissible coronary diseases.
More than 30 per cent of patients experience cold-kiss symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases of a high mortality respiratory syndrome (34.4%) were recorded, therefore MERS-CoV is considered one of the most deadly viruses known to humans.
From the middle of December to the end of 2019, in the province of Hobbey, a group of patients with pneumonia has been identified, which is now being examined in the past, linked to the infection caused by a serious type 2 acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization has announced that the continuing outbreak of low respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global emergency in the field of public health, and the same disease has been known as “Coronavirus 19” (COVID-19).
As at 3 March 2020, 90,053 confirmed cases were registered worldwide, with deaths of approximately 3.4 per cent.
It should be noted that death in the Chinese province of Hobbey was 4.2 per cent and 1.2 per cent at its borders.
SARS-CoV-2, such as SARS and MERS, is a serious respiratory infection characterized by increased temperature, bone and individuality.
Some patients also have diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly pass into severe respiratory failure.
Despite the similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, taking into account the high gomology of nucleotide sequences (82 per cent), these viruses, however, form a variety of plant species of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has a greater ability to transfer compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of unsympathetic infection SARS-CoV-2 have been recorded, which demonstrates the ability to spread the virus rapidly throughout the world.
The comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other six human crown viruses reveals significant similarities and differences.
First, the human transmission of coronavirus has a similar period of incubation and the duration of the disease caused by it.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the same trend as the remaining six human crown viruses.
Second, the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms is found between SARS-CoV and four human crown viruses that cause inflammatory infections (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is similar to that seen most often when human coronary infections occur, including non-specific manifestations, mild symptoms, or even lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subgroup of serious cases of COVID-19 can be identified, although the ratio here is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 also highlights the interesting legality that is both for human crown viruses that are caused by infectious infections, as well as for SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transferability of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human crown viruses that cause communicable infections.
On the other hand, there is still a need to check whether SARS-CoV-2 is reduced with each subsequent transmission of the virus (i.e. infection of each of the following persons), such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other human crown viruses that cause communicable infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in rock samples.
We still have to answer the question whether the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 is as important (at least in some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
It is also of particular interest to ask whether SARS-CoV-2 may be present, which is characterised by human crown viruses that cause communicable infections.
Nevertheless, the future development of COVID-19 will depend on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transferability, pathogenicity and sustainable distribution after transition.
All four human crown viruses, causing communicable infections with mild forms of symptoms, were well adapted to humans.
On the other hand, these people may have been well adapted to these four human crown viruses.
In other words, those and others could be referred to as the only survivors after the pandemics of human crown viruses in the past.
Human crown viruses that cause serious diseases in humans and people in which human crown viruses cause serious diseases have simply not survived.
In order to do so, human coronaviruses should be repatriated in the human body sufficiently in order to produce appropriate mutations that are contrary to the factors of the carrier's limitations.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the more people will be infected, the more chance that the virus is fully adapted to humans.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to stop human transmission by means of quarantine or other activities to control infectious diseases.
For many years, the population has been circulatory infections that are common to healthy immunosuppressants.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
The high-patogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been adequately adapted to humans, and their transfer to humans cannot be supported.
They need to remain and multiply in their zone reserves and to seek the case of disasters in acceptable human missions, perhaps through one or more intermediate or strengthening carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV, and four extracellular HCoV viruses.
It's very easy to transmit, like the extrapolated HCoV, at least at the present time.
But he's more pathogenic than non-problem HCoV and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it is fully adapted to human beings and whether it will be circulared in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate animal carrier.
Before discussing the origin of HCV viruses, it will be useful for us to consider the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, intermediate, strengthening, and reservoirs of HCV viruses.
The animal serves as an evolutionary carrier of HCoV if it carries a close family advance with the same high level of neucleotide sequence.
The previous virus is usually well adapted and unsatisfied in this carrier.
In the same way, the container is constantly transferred to HCoV over a long period of time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are the natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV was only taken into the intermediate carrier just before or around the time when it was taken by a person, it was not properly adapted to the new carrier and was often pathogenic.
This intermediate carrier may serve as a zone source of human infection and play the role of a strengthening carrier, allowing the virus to be re-repetitious and then transmitted to its people by increasing the level of human injury.
HCoV may be transferred to a vacuum infection if it is not possible to maintain the internal transmission of the intermediate carrier.
On the contrary, HCoV viruses can also adapt to the intermediate carrier and even establish long-term anaemia.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural reserve carrier.
Epidemiological data have shown retrospectively that a zero patient in SARS has been in close contact with the pet food (child).
Further studies showed that the IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV virus were higher than the population in general.
The Himalayas (Pagua larvata) and the entovisive dog on the markets of live animals were the first to be identified by virus carriers such as and almost identical SARS-CoV.
This was consistently confirmed by the fact that no further reports were reported after the destruction of all civilians on the SARS markets.
At the same time, it was reported that, in both natural and non-marketed types, there was no determination in most cases, that it was possible to conclude that gladiators could serve only as an intermediate booster rather than a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that because 80 per cent of the various animals on the Guangzhou market have an antibodies to SARS-CoV, it cannot be ruled out that intermediate boosters can also serve a wide range of small dairy products.
They're all said to be the dumb carrier of the SARS-CoV virus.
The next search by SARS-CoV has identified a nearby CoV flying mouse, which is known as a typical sub-region of HKU3 flying mice (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is present in Chinese flying flying mice.
These mice are positive for SARS-CoV antibodies and the genetic consistency of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other coronaviruses are 88 to 92 per cent of the same carbon sequences as SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the basis for a new concept that flies became carriers of new human pathogens.
A number of SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been detected in flying mice, but none of them, except one that is identified as HIV1, cannot be isolated as a live virus.
It is known that SARS-CoV receptor is human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It has been shown that WIV1, obtained from the testing of flakes of flying mice, uses ACE2 flies, civets and human beings as a receptor for entry into the cell.
Interestingly, sarcoidosis of patients with SARS could neutralize HIV1.
Today, the WIV1 represents the closest family front of SARS-CoV in flying mice, with 95 per cent of the nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high gomology between these two viruses, it is generally considered that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus SARS-CoV, and that flies are not directly reserved for SARS-CoV.
The philogenetic analysis refers to the same group as the CoV-HKU4 flyers and the CoV-HKU5 flyers.
CoV-HKU4 flies and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, diptylpideptidase-4 (DPP4) to detect viruses.
The follow-up of the RNC-dependent RNC-polymerase of the MERS-CoV virus is philosophically close to the follow-up of the bacteracronic virus detected in Europe and Africa.
Until then, no live MERS-CoV virus was found in the wild flying mice.
The neucleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its close relative CoV-HKU25 flyers are only 87 per cent.
That's the fly mouse could not be the direct reservoir carrier of the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that one-fold vertebrates are sero-positive to neutralising antibodies, specific to MERS-CoV, as well as vertebrates of Middle East origin in many African countries.
The live MERS-CoV, an identical virus found in humans, was identified from the nasal fats of one worm, which further confirms the role of the worms as the true reservoirs of the METS-CoV.
It is also noted that there have been minor symptoms, but massive viral exposure, in the vertebrates, experimentally infected MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that infected red blood cells have been administered not only by respiratory means but also by faeces, which is also the main way to treat the virus in the larynx.
However, questions remain, as many confirmed cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome have not been identified in contact with pre-symptoms and are likely to be related to human transmission or transfer of unknown channels including undetected species of animals that are carrying the MERS-CoV.
The saris-CoV-2 nucleotide gomology is 96.2% similar to the CoV RatG13 flying mice allocated to the Asian subcontinent Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the discrepancies between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 are too large to subscribe to parental relations.
It is a fly of mice that could not be directly reserved for SARS-CoV-2 unless nearly identical coronaviruses of flies are found in the future.
It is assumed that SARS-CoV-2 direct animal carriers should be among the wild species that sell and die on the marine optimum market for marine products that have been linked to many of the initial cases of COVID-19, which is evidence of a likely case of human transfer.
A number of recent studies on the basis of metagenic sequencing concluded that the group at risk for the destruction of small dairy products known as pangoline (Manis javanica) could also transfer the parent betaconavirus, a family strain SARS-CoV-2.
The homology of the traceability of these new pangoline coronovirus genes is 85 to 92 per cent consistent with SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely related to RatG13, with the identity of the nucleotide sequences is about 90 per cent.
They are classified in two areas of differentiation of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, in a phylogenetic tree, one of which is closer to SARS-CoV-2, with the traceability of amino acid at 97.4 per cent.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 strains are more diverse, despite the higher level of homology of consistency in all genes.
In the earlier study of pathogens, it was also reported that viral contaminants were identified in simple tests, which were similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Other methods of collection and manual processing were used in this study to achieve the consistency of the gene, which included approximately 86.3 per cent of the full-scale virus gene.
It is not possible to exclude that Pangolin has become one of SARS-CoV-2 intermediate carriers.
However, due to the divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangoline beta-coron virus, family SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 of pangolon.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 is more than between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-coronovirus related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolution path of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been established in flying mice, pangolins and other dairy products.
At the time, the highest tracer homologous was found in RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronoviruses of pangoline, family SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13, the highest traceability of all genes.
Very theoretically, high level of similarity between the beta-coV-pangoline virus, family SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 is linked to parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal is based on the combination of the beta-coronavirus with the family SARS-CoV-2, and the RTG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As the driving force of evolution, the recombination is widely spread among beta-acrenoviruses.
The final decision on the direct zone origin of SARS-CoV-2 still does not exist.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV viruses, zone origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 are also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence shows that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may occur from coronaviruses of flying mice, while parental strains of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are found in grison.
It has been reported that the coronavirus of flying mice called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and identified in the North American triangular neighboring community demonstrate a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to other corona virus known as Hippoderos/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that its intermediate carrier could also be vulnerable.
For the sake of clarity, current knowledge of the origin of certain bovine animals is summarized in Figure 1 and in Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has shown the effects of the intermediate transfer of HCoV into the anemone.
When HCV-OC43 was transmitted by intermediate transmissions of HCV-OC43 and people were infected with domestic animals, the pandemic was registered.
The history of the intermediate transmission of HCoV-229E is not so clear.
Alfacoreviruses have been detected in flies near HCoV-229E.
Among them is alphacoronovirus alpacas.
Some data support the direct transmission of viruses from flying mice.
First of all, people, not alpines, could contact flying mice in a common environmental nest.
At the same time, people are in close contact with alpines.
Second, avian influenza virus, family HCoV-229E, is diverse and pathogenic in humans, while alfacoron virus alpacas has caused respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpacas alpine alpacas were not detected in wild animals.
Thus, it is not possible to exclude the likelihood that alpacas received alphacoronavirus, the family HCoV-229E, from humans.
In fact, flies are the direct source of infectious human viruses, including hepatitis, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is not surprising, therefore, that flies could be transmitted directly to people HCoV-229E.
On the other hand, while the alphacoronoviruses of flying mice could serve as a gene virus of HCoV-229E, alpacas and one-armed worms could become intermediate carriers that transmit human viruses, just as in the case of MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of the interstellar transfer from flying mice to one ear and from one ear to the other.
The evolutional origin of the MERS-CoV virus from flies is known for its initial identification and was subsequently confirmed by the following studies.
It is evident that flies provide rich pools of viruses for the exchange of gene fragments and intermediation.
The long-term, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and flight capacity are made by flying mice “ideal distributors”.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced by a single tumor decades ago.
It was well adapted to these valves that were converted from the intermediate carrier into a stable and natural reservoir.
These animals have been infected with MERS-CoV very easily and have a relatively low frequency of mutations.
Its epidemiological transmission is an accident, and the person remains a dumb carrier of MERS-CoV, as its transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of the verbs in the transfer of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transfer of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In particular, pangoline betacona virus is highly pathogenic in pangoline.
They may be top-up carriers of beta-coVs, relatives of SARS-CoV-2, as well as civilians in SARS-CoV.
In future studies, a number of possibilities for the intermediate transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals should be confirmed or removed.
First, flies can be a replacement carrier for the virus, family SARS-CoV-2, almost identical SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can make the nest with flying mice by looking or dividing the nests of these animals.
Secondly, pangolins can be one of the intermediate pushers in which the family SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently collapsed.
People are infected by the virus through the distribution of tobacco and the consumption of meat of wild animals.
It is quite possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
The investigation of domestic animals and wild animals on the antibodies has been justified.
Thirdly, as indicated above, the combination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could occur in a third type, which has been associated with flying mice and Pangolins.
SARS-CoV-2 continues to search for animal origin.
In addition to the various types of animal carriers, three main factors of the virus have also contributed to cross-border barriers.
First of all, their relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other viruses with the same-time RNA, the calculated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered to be “mean-high” with an average replacement of approximately 10-4 times a year in one area 2 depending on the adaptation phase of Coronavirus to new economies.
Coronaviruses have an adjustment of exorabonoclase, which has resulted in an extremely high frequency of mutation and weakness or even incompatibility.
It is interesting that the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir has caused the replication of coronavirus through the induction of this exorbonic acid and RNC-dependent RNC polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising drugs against SARS-CoV-2 that should be tested during clinical studies.
Nevertheless, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is nearly a million times higher than their carriers.
In addition, the frequency of mutations can often be even higher if they are not properly adapted to the carrier.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high frequency of mutants, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 mutations is shown below, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
The virus is likely to have been adapted to another human carrier.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, well-adapted to one ear.
It is theoretically unlikely that vaccines and anti-virus agents from SARS-CoV-2 will quickly lose their effectiveness as a result of the genetic drive.
Secondly, the large gene of the RNA in the coronavirus is leading to increased plasticity in the genetic modification of mutations and recombination, thereby increasing the likelihood of inter-species evolution that is favourable to the emergence of new coronaviruses under the appropriate conditions.
This contributes to a wide range of unique open frameworks of counting and functions of whites coded in the direction of the 3′ end of the gene.
Thirdly, due to the unique mechanism for the selection of matrices, coronaviruses are randomly and often replaced by matrices during the RNA replication.
During the transcription of DNA coronavirus in the carrier, which serves as a mixed trial, it is often replaced.
High-gemological full-scale and subgenome RNAs can combine and create new coroner viruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found both in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 flies.
Interference of the virus—transmitter
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, another key factor that is important for intermediate transmission is the interaction of the virus with the carrier's receptor.
In this article, the SARS-CoV recombination is also shown as a typical example, which also demonstrates the positive selection in the event of an intermodal transfer.
On the basis of a comparative analysis between SARS-CoV human and civilian strains, it is considered that SARS-CoV is undergoing rapid adaptation to various carriers, particularly with regard to white S S STS mutations.
In general, RSD white S coronavirus interacts with a cell receptor, and the carrier's response is intensively selected.
The SARS-CoV RSD is a amino acid from 318 to 510, to S1 fragment, which is linked to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (APF2) human and its receptors for the introduction of the virus into the cell.
SARS-CoV virus RSD is able to identify receptors of different animals, including flies, mice, mice and entovisive dogs, making possible the transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues, which are different from human and civilian strains, have been detected in the RSD, 4 of which are in the receptor-related motivation for interaction with APH2 receptors.
SARS-CoV has mutations K479N and S487T in the RSD, which can increase the affinity of schipobic protein interaction with human AFP2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes can be particularly important to adapt the virus to humans.
It is noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30 per cent difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in segment S1 white S leads to a change in the related white S to human AFF2.
In fact, a study using a CRI-electronic microscope says that the ratio is 10 to 20 times higher than that between AAF2 and S.S.S.S.R.-CoV.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other contractors are required to transfer SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 is also linked to APF2 but with another segment of white S.
There are many other HCoV receptors such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetyl acid for HCoV-OC43.
They can also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coral viruses to humans after the intermediate transfer from animal carriers.
In addition to cell receptors, the results of the intermediate HCoV transmission are also controlled by other factors of dependence and limitation of the carrier.
The differentiation of these protein carriers between humans and natural reservoirs of HCoVs, such as flies of mice, single shells and graffiti, can be a barrier to intermediation.
For the successful intermediation of HCoV viruses, the factors of dependence have to be confused and the factors of the restriction of the carriers.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier are still needed for identification and classification.
Good results can be provided by an unpredictably full range of dependence and resuscitation factors for SARS-CoV-2 with the help of new CRISPR technology.
New HCoV: Back to zero note
The diversity of coronaviruses of flying mice provides a wide range of opportunities for new HCoVs.
In this sense, the coronaviruses of flying mice serve as a genetic disease for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also the driving force of HCoV evolution and serve two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new white-coding genes has the potential to radically modify virus phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV accessories are considered important for human adaptation to ORF8, such as the virus of flying mice, the SARS-CoV family has been isolated, but it has been established that they are coded with different ORF8 proteins.
The 29-nucleotide delegation was identified in the stamps isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This delegation divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and considers it an adaptive mutation that accelerates the change of carriers.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible combinations with alpha and gamma-coronovirus lines where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in the RNC-dependent RNC-polymerase.
The location of the combination was also determined in non-structured white nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
In a similar way, the epidemiological MERS-COV has been shown to be a combination of events between different lines, which took place in one of the summits in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCoVs in which HCoV was recombined with other animal coroner viruses in its inorganic genes.
It is also necessary to warn that artificial selection can contribute to unforeseen changes in viral genes, which is most likely due to the removal of the virus from the selective pressure, such as from the carrier's immune system.
The example of these effects is the loss of full-scale ORF4 in the prototype HCoV-229E by a two-cellged delegation.
At the same time as an interactive opening of the ORF4 count, it can be observed in mice and vertebral viruses derived from HCoV-229E, an alphacoronovirus of the alpacas demonstrates a single nucleotide input that leads to a speeding of the frame.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also due to the pressure of the selection of their reserve carriers.
The signs or absences of those symptoms were reported by the fluorescent coronaviruses, which referred to a mutual adaptation between the coronavirus and the flying mouse.
It has been said that muscle fluids have been chemically and physically adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, failure to activate the oral response in flies effectively reduces the pathology caused by coronavirus.
In addition, the natural activity of the killer cell in the flying mouse is affected by the abruguing of the inhibition receptor of the NKG2/CD94 and the low level of the molecular of the major class of histoscisity complex.
Moreover, the high level of active acidic acids, which provides high metabolic activity of flying mice, may contribute to the replication of coronavirus, at the same time affecting exhrobonic acid count, thereby creating a choice for the generation of strains of the virus that are highly pathogens when it comes to the new carrier.
More pathogens of coronavirus can also evolve as a result of recombination, resulting in new whites or white properties to adapt the carrier.
Thus, it is not coincidence that in the last twenty years, three new human crown viruses have appeared.
Coronaviruses are pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoirs, such as flies of mice or worms.
They are likely to respond without a strong immune response to the carrier.
This is a secret to why we see unsympathetic carriers and what causes serious cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly associated with the hyperactivity of immune response and cytokine fever, with a stronger immune response, making it easier to detect.
On the other hand, non-sympathetic carriers have no immune response to the replication of coronavirus.
The same strategy of non-relating immune response may have beneficial effects in the treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
A particularly strong interferon response in flying mice.
Thus, the type I interferon must have a positive effect in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, NLRP3-inflammase activation has been destroyed in flying mice.
Based on this induction NLRP3-inflammase with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The establishment of SARS-CoV-2 is followed by a common scheme for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While a beta-coronovirus was found, a 95 per cent nucleotide gomology corresponds to SARS-CoV, there is also a coronavirus of the fly mouse, and a nucleotide gomology of 96 per cent is equivalent to SARS-CoV-2.
Although it was found that civilians and other animals on the market carried viruses, the SARS-CoV identifiers were not directly established for SARS-CoV-2.
Bactacoroneviruses of pangoline have been found, rather homologous SARS-CoV-2, which indicates that the pangolins could serve as one of the intermediate carriers, or that the gene gene segments of pangoline pangolins could be added to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by man.
Coronaviruses drew attention to themselves due to recent outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronavirus in flying mice and other animals has radically changed our understanding of the importance of zone origin and of HCOV conservation in human transmission.
Evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are from flying mice and have been transmitted to humans through intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between people and cities on the market, closing the markets and destroying the tissue on them could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the opening of different lines of pangoline beta-coVs, neighbouring SARS-CoV-2, it is necessary to remove pangolins in order to prevent zone transmission of infection from the product markets.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other milk-producing agents and how this can continue to be the subject of future studies.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has existed for a long time in one root worm.
These scrolls serve as an important vehicle, as well as as the main source of meat, milk, skin and products from the grass for the local population.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and in Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to offer all the surveys for control over MERS, as this has been done on Chinese wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the periodic outbreaks of MERS, an integrated approach should be taken to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV in combination with other infection control measures.
Because we can't eliminate these viruses, new genotypes that cause outbreaks of disease may occur.
In the world, various ozone-depleting viruses are circulating.
In particular, there are an extremely diverse variety of coronaviruses of flying mice with zone potential.
There is a large number of possibilities for the evolution and recombining of these zone-based crown viruses, which will lead to new crown viruses that are easier to transmit and/or more deadly to humans in the future.
In order to reduce the number of long-term contacts between humans and animals, there should be a decline in the culture of feeding wild animals in some areas of China.
After severe trials such as SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plan are needed.
In fact, many viruses existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reserves until it is possible to capture new territories.
While many of the properties of flying mice are beneficial for the spread of viruses, learning to stay away from them can minimize the likelihood of contact with flying mice and other wild animals.
In order to better understand the environment of coral viruses and their natural carriers, permanent epidemiological surveillance is required for lactating people, which will be useful in preventing the transfer of coral viruses from human beings and future outbreaks of diseases.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent the virus zone is to keep humans away from the environment of the natural reservoirs of the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 is still missing some fragments.
First of all, if the flies have been transferred to the SARS-CoV-2 pangolins, it is interesting to see the conditions in which the flies and pangolins divide the same environmental node.
Secondly, if flies play a more direct role in the transfer of human beings, it is necessary to determine how people have been contacted with flying mice.
Thirdly, if the role of the true intermediate carrier is to play a third milk-producing role, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with various types, including human, flying mice and pangolins.
Finally, since many dairy people, including domestic animals, can be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
It is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its precursors will be identified in their natural containers.
Further studies in this area have led to the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update diagnostic criteria for “supposes of disease” and “certified cases” COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our group published a brief guide on diagnosis and treatment of new coronary infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information on our experience and recommendations for combating this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronary infection in 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our understanding and knowledge has increased gradually as a result of current research and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and introduced new diagnostic criteria for “supposes of disease” and “certified cases” in accordance with the COVID-19 recommendations (seventh version) issued by the National Committee for the Health of the CDR.
In December 2019 the outbreak of a new coronary virus 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially renamed COVID 2019 (COVID-19), and the same virus has been called “a severe acute respiratory syndrome 2” (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our group developed a short reference guide and published it on the website of Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
This publication drew great attention to itself.
Noting that COVID-19 is a new disease, our understanding and knowledge has been gradually increased based on current research and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been constantly updated.
For example, from 16 January to 3 March 2020, seven issues of the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Recommendation were issued, published by the National Committee for the Health of the CNR (http://www.hhc.gov.cn/), with significant changes in the content of some of its provisions.
Recently, comments on our recommendations were made by Zhou (Zhou) and were made on the basis of simple diagnostic proposals based on existing clinical experience.
This work has added to our recommendations new practical evidence and has provided valuable background information on this pandemic, covering the world.
We acknowledge the high importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest edition of the “COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Recommendations” (test seventh version) and the results of the current studies, their work needs to be updated.
In accordance with the seventh edition of this document (from 3 March 2020), for a comprehensive analysis of the disease, it is necessary to combine any element of epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of movement or presence in H. Hughan and its surroundings or other public sites where cases of COVID-19 have been recorded during 14 days prior to symptoms; (2) history of contacts with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test based on nuclear acid); (3) history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from H. Hugh and its severity or other population sites where cases of COVID-19 disease have been recorded during the last 14 days; and history of contacts with patients with COVID-19 prior to symptoms; and (3) history of contact with patients with high-temperature or respiratory symptoms with COVID symptoms; and other public sites where cases of COVID-19 cases have been recorded; and cases of COVID-19 cases have been recorded during the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (2) contacts with patients with SARS-CoV-2 (sees of type of type of patients; 2)
Clinical manifestations: (1) high temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) the presence of external symptoms of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of leukocytes is normal or reduced with a reduced number of lymphocytes at the early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis for the confirmed disease should be based on a suspicion of disease with one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence, namely: (1) the IgG PCR test in real-time is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the complete sequence of the virus shows high homogenous relative to new coronary viruses; (3) the positive results of the serotype for specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies IgM and IgG; or the change of the test from positive to positive to positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies IgG, or the age of the virus at least 4 times.
It can also be noted that on the second (18 January 2020) and on the third (22 January 2020) issues of that document, the CPC test was added in real-time for nucleotide acids in respiratory pathways or blood tests.
The pathogenic blood test diagnosis was added on the fourth (27 January 2020) and on the fifth (8 February 2020) issues; then the seventh edition added the need for serological evidence.
These changes are based on the continuing work of researchers who sought the optimal collection of nucleoline acids for rapid diagnosis, as well as the analysis of samples taken from respiratory pathways, including the selection of blood samples, which enhances the availability of various samples and facilitates the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the disease testing criteria.
However, more and more evidence of the need to exercise caution in the treatment of patients with atypical symptoms and patients with no known symptoms is available.
Thus, the road map presented in Zhou and etc. should be updated, as persons with no clinical symptoms are classified as a “low risk group”.
The evaluation system also requires clarification in further clinical practice and studies.
Finally, we note that we hope to obtain more direct evidence and call on readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “disquieting cases of disease” and “certified cases”, we urge readers to follow up and follow closely the latest recommendations made in the countries in which they live.
Our group will also update its recommendations on time for effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 — daily maximum
Last night, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 per day.
It's the largest number of deaths from the virus per day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Epidemiology, Control and Disease Studies (IEDCR) reported that 114 cases of infection were reported and 33 patients were present at home.
There were 17 deaths.
In the online briefing, director of the IEDCR, Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora, told that the victims had become four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two were over 60 years old, two were from 51 to 60 years old, and one was from 41 to 50 years old.
She also reported that the two dead were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
A clinical staff member reported to the local news agency Anadulu that Jill Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at the Metri Kuwaiti clinic, was one of the victims.
On Saturday, in the online video release, the Minister of Car Transport and Bridges of Bangladesh Obidul Qader stated that the public transport work would be terminated longer than planned to be scheduled until the following Saturday.
The public transport work was resumed on 26 March and was to be resumed on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of first needs — medicines, fuel and food — was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection were recorded in Bangladesh on 8 March in two persons who returned from Italy and one of the women.
By March 19, these three people had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has exceeded the millions of cases of infection worldwide
According to the University of Johns Hopkins, in the fourth quarter, the number of cases of viral infection by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide increased by one million.
Of the coroner COVID-19, at least 52 thousand people have been killed.
The first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi on the same day as the first case of infection in Zambia, and the first case of the death of Coronavirus in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that on Thursday it was one of the few countries in which cases of infection had not been established.
As yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed injuries, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours prior to 10:00 in Central-European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244 thousand cases of coronary infection have been recorded, of which at least 5,900 have been reported.
CBS News, referring to data from the University of Johns Hopkins, reported that more than 1,000 deaths caused by coronary infection had been recorded in the United States.
Countries around the world have announced a wave of measures to prevent the spread of disease.
In Moscow's fourth mayor, Sergei Sobyanin extended the civil self-determination regime until 1 May.
Former President Vladimir Putin stated that growth throughout the country, despite self-sustainment, would be paid by 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of the extension of the emergency situation for 15 days; the results of the vote: 215 votes to ten, with one abstention.
Saudi Arabia extended the time of command in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina throughout the day, while the time of command lasted only 3 hours until 6 o'clock in the morning.
Thailand planned to enter a command hour from 10 a.m. until 4 a.m.
The Governor of Ohio, Mike Dewain, announced that the domestic self-determination regime in the State territory was extended by order until 1 May.
Stores in Australia are limited to the quantity of toilet book packages that can be purchased once
On Wednesday and Saturday evening, the Australian Woolworth and Cole stores networks have reduced the number of toilet books packages that can be purchased once in all shops of the country, up to two and one packs, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also limited one package.
These restrictions have been reported on the lists as well as on the Facebook web page.
It is reported that citizens have begun to make extra savings because of the fears that COVID-19 might result in the introduction of a common self-sustainment regime.
In the middle of the network, Woolworths also limited the number of toilet books purchased to one package.
Earlier, 4 and 5 March respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already limited this number to 4 packages.
In its press release of 8 March, the Coles reported that with restrictions on four packages “in many stores, the toilet book is still too fast – one supply over time”, and called this “unprecedented”, while ALDI, published on Tuesday, called this trend “unexpected”.
According to the representative of Woolworths, a sharp increase in sales last week was observed.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited this number to two packages last week.
In order to meet the deficit, Cole ordered larger parties to suppliers and increased supply rates, Woolworths ordered additional parties, while ALDI made spares for a special action prior to the sale of the environment.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Ritual Association, reported that the Rituals are trying to fill stocks, but this is difficult with regard to the restrictions of local authorities on the registration of freight cars.
He expects the increase in the worth of the products, as suppliers are trying to satisfy the demand, but there are still less favourable proposals available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that some stores could not take action on the environment due to their savings.
In the report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a trade expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said that stores were filling stocks every night.
He noted that the toilet book was a commodity, so the quantity of warehouses was small, and after the sale of all the goods, a number of long sections remained empty, strengthening the sense of lack of stocks.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if the fields could be filled and goods such as toilet books and hand-drawn tools could be placed on these fields in large quantities, buyers would probably not be so panicked,” says Russell Zimmerman.
In the past, the manufacturer of the processed toilet book Who Gives a Crap reported the end of the stocks.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the company manufacturer of the toilet books Kleinex and Solaris Paper, as well as Sorbent brands, reported that they were working around to ensure a sufficient quantity of goods.
Domain.com, the real estate sale site reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne was reduced due to the absence of buyers on the week of work, some real estate sellers began to offer the first auction participants a free toilet book.
The fourth edition of the daily NT News printed in Darwin included an eight-page tab for drawing and using as a toilet book.
According to the ABC Australia report of 3 March, the beginnings of stores have imposed unduly restrictions on the number of goods acquired, stating that they are not planning to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also used with increased demand, including medical masks, hand-drawn, gallanter, hand-matching and pain-free.
Similarly, in addition to the events in Australia, it was noted on Wednesday evening that the British supermarket online stores of Ocado also limited the sale of the toilet book Andres by two packages of 12 scrolls.
World Health Organization announces the COVID-19 pandemic
In the middle of the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Health Organization announced a pandemic of COVID-19 infection caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Although the term “pandamia” is limited to the extent of disease, rather than the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that Governments need to take action:
“All countries are still in a position to influence the development of pandemics”.
This is possible if countries are to identify, test, treat, isolate the sick, follow-up to cases of illness, as well as to mobilize their citizens,” said Mr. Tedros Adam Gabrielus, Director General of WHO.
“We are deeply concerned about both the alarming level of spread and the severity of the disease and the alarming level of inactivity”.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic is “unpredictable”.
In his interview, transmitted by CNN in February, he said that “we have not followed another respiratory virus other than influenza since its emergence to the continuous global spread”.
Mr. Gabrielus made a similar point of view, saying that “we have never observed pandemics caused by the crown virus.
We have also never seen pandemics that can be controlled before."
Initially, in January, WHO announced the outbreak of this emergency situation in the field of public health, which was of international importance and then introduced a new status as a pandemic.
The director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infections, Dr. Anthony Fauchi, said: “This is just beginning to get worse.”
According to the Associated Press, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
Coronavirus Pandemic 2019-2020 – is currently present at the time of the 2019 Coronovirus pandemic (COVID-19) caused by a severe severe respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Hughan, China, in December 2019, and on 30 January 2020, the international emergency situation in the field of public health was announced, which was subsequently recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 disease have been recorded in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people were cured.
The mortality rate in China is 4 per cent, while it varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include liqueur, cough, and difficulty breathing.
The potential complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory stress syndrome.
The time from the first symptoms to the outbreak usually consists of about five days, but it can also vary from two to fourteen days.
No vaccine or special treatment has been found.
The recommended preventive measures include handwashing, drying of the neck, monitoring of the distance between people, identification and self-insinuation of people suspected of infection.
Governments around the world have responded to the situation by imposing restrictions on travel, quarantine measures, time-limits, risk control at work and the closure of various facilities.
The pandemic has led to serious global social and economic consequences, transfer or abolition of sports, religious, political and cultural activities, as well as a wide-ranging lack of goods that are undermined by panic procurement.
Schools and universities were closed at national or regional levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4% of students worldwide.
In the Internet, there were cases of Xenophobic and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other Eastern and South-East Asian citizens, or people who had forgotten them outside, as well as other groups of people living in areas where significant cases of virus spread have been identified.
As a result of the decrease in travel and closure of heavy industries, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities of the city of Huhan (the capital of the province of Hobbey), China, reported the occurrence of pneumonia for an unknown reason, and the situation began to be investigated early in January 2020.
The cases of infection were mainly related to the Hughan sea product's optimum market, so the virus, as they believe, has a zone origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a recent open virus that is similar to the coronavirus of the fly mouse, pangolon virus and SARS-CoV. It was subsequently found that the first outbreak occurred on 1 December 2019 and that the infected did not visit the market after that date.
Two thirds of the damages recorded in December 2019 were related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, the publication of the South-China newspaper Morning Post, which had not been verified, suggested that the first case of torture had occurred with the 55-year-old resident of the province of Hobbey on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new cases of infection in China had decreased, but the number of new cases outside China had suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea.
The number of cases of illness may be significantly reduced, in particular due to the number of cases with mild-expressed symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases of young people were recorded, with patients 19 years of age and younger, less than 2.4 per cent of the world's population.
The statistics include cases of injury of persons tested in COVID-19 and whose test was positive under official protocols.
As at 23 March, no country was able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, official policies were adopted that did not require testing to be performed with only minor symptoms.
A study published on 16 March showed that 86 per cent of COVID-19 infections were not detected in China until 23 January and that such unregistered diseases were the source of injury for 79 per cent of registered cases.
The statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of cases of actual injury in Italy was significantly higher than the number of recorded cases.
The initial evaluation of the baseline reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
In a study published by the United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, it is estimated that this figure could be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 are getting better.
In other, more complex cases, the time from the beginning of symptoms to the time of death was 6 to 41 days, the most partial period of 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, some 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
As at 5 February, about 80% of deaths occurred in China, while 75% of those who died of congenital diseases, including heart disease and diabetes, usually include deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic, with positive results from COVID testing performed under official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher because official figures may not take into account dead people who have not passed tests — for example, in the case of deaths at home, in the homes of the elderly, etc.
The incomplete data on Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded official COVID rates 4-5 times.
The U.S. Secretary-General for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledges: “We know that [the number of dead] is lower than actual”. His words are confirmed by reports of some isolated cases in the United States, such as the outbreak of the H1N1 swine flu in 2009, and the first confirmed death was recorded in Uhana on 9 January 2020.
The first death was registered outside China’s motherhood on February 1 in the Philippines and outside Asia on February 14 in France.
By 28 February more than 10 deaths were recorded outside China's motherhood: Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, countries and regions in all continents, except Antarctica, reported deaths, and several methods were used to assess mortality.
All indicators vary depending on the region and the time of spread of disease; they also affect the levels of testing, quality of health systems used in treatment schemes, from the beginning of the outbreak of disease and population parameters such as age, gender and overall health. The death/disease factor is the number of deaths due to the number of diagnosed cases during the time period.
According to statistics from the University of Johns Hopkins, as of 10 April 2020, the global number of deaths and injuries is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204).
Data vary from region to region.
In China, mortality rates decreased from 17.3 per cent (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include the determination of the percentage of death resulting from disease (CFR) — the percentage of patients diagnosed who die from disease and the percentage of death from infection (IFR) that reflects the percentage of patients infected ( both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not linked to a specific period of time and reflect the indicators of certain population groups from the time of injury to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these indicators by specific groups of people.
According to the assessment of the Oxford University Medical Centre, the mortality rate of this pandemic is between 0.1 and 0.39 per cent.
The above figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first permit test at COVID-19 in Germany, as well as with a statistical study that analyzes the impact of CFR assessment.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the exact duration of the shock are not defined and may vary depending on the location.
Mace Boni, a staff member of the University of Pennsylvania, claims that “uncontrolled infection outbreaks usually go to bed and then, when the number of available carriers is over, they start to burn.
In the present situation, however, it is virtually impossible to predict any reasonable forecast as to when this will happen.”
The senior medical adviser of the Chinese Government, Zung Nanishan, claims that “all can end by June”, if all countries can mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 “will be circulatored for perhaps a year or two”.
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College under the direction of Nila Ferguson, “until a vaccine (may be 18 months or more) is established”, physical distance measures and other measures will be required.
William Schaffner, a staff member of the University of Vanderbilt, says: “I do not think that this corona virus will ever disappear from us, because it is so easily transmitted”, and that it “may become a seasonal disease, winning every year.”
The validity of new advances will depend on collective immunity and degree of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific, and some infected people may carry disease without symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are increased temperature (88 per cent) and dry cough (68 per cent).
The less common symptoms include stiffness, dyskinesia (sitis), loss of consciousness, pain in the muscles and joints, pain in the throat, headaches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, or cionosis. WHO claims that this is a serious form of respiratory problems for about six people.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists such immediate symptoms as respiratory distress, persistent pain or chest depression, sudden unconsciousness of consciousness, difficulty in awakening and healing of the person or loss.
Some infected people may suffer unsympatheticly, without any clinical evidence, but the results of the analyses confirm the severity of infection, so doctors recommend that patients be placed in close contact with patients whose diagnosis is confirmed, under strict control, and investigate infection.
According to Chinese scientists, the number of cases of non-sympathetic disease ranges from several units to 44 per cent of all cases.
The usual incubation period (time between infection and symptoms) is from one to 14 days; it usually consists of five days. Until there is no full light on the symptoms of inflammation: at initial estimates, the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed the symptoms was 30 per cent and then fell to 15 per cent.
Some details of how the disease is spread are still unknown.
It is considered that the disease is primarily transmitted during close contact, as well as through small capillaries that are given in the air together with a bowel, chicory or during conversation; contact is understood to be in the radius of 1 to 2 meters (from 3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, capillary can be extended from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
There are assumptions that the virus may also be transmitted through small caps issued in the air during conversation that can remain in the air for longer periods. Respiratory caps can also be formed at exits, including during conversation, even though the virus is not normally transferred to the air.
The capillaries may fall into the mouth or carry a number of people, as well as into the light.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiac resuscitation (SLDs), may lead to the spread of respiratory products and therefore to the spread of air viruses.
It can also penetrate the body if a person is affected by contaminated surfaces, including skin, with subsequent irritation to his eyes, nose or beard.
There is also a threat that the virus may be transmitted through failure, but the risk of such transmission is low.
The Government of China rejects the possibility of sending SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most infected within the first three days of symptoms, although its spread may occur both before symptoms occur and at later stages of disease.
There have been cases when tests were positive in the three days prior to symptoms, and this suggests the possibility of transmission of the virus to the expression of symptoms.
There are only a few reports of laboratory confirmed cases of non-sympathetic disease, but studies on contact monitoring in some countries have also identified cases of transmission of disease from non-sympathetic carriers.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) claims that until it is clear how easily the virus is spread, however, it is known that it is usually infected by 2 to 3 other people.
In particular, it was found that the virus can live up to three days on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on a running table (304), on a cardboard surface for one day, and on a soft surface for up to four hours.
However, these data vary according to humidity and temperature, and positive results have been obtained from domestic and other animals at COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus on to humans, although British authorities advise to wash their hands after contact with animals, just as after contact with other surfaces to which infected people could be subjected.
The severe severe respiration syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the new virus first identified in three people with pneumonia from the group with severe respiratory diseases recorded in Hughan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the natural environment of the family corona virus. The virus can be destroyed with the aid of a domestic emulsifier. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is assumed to have a zone origin.
The genetic analysis of Coronavirus showed that it is genetically classified with Betacoronavirus, Sarbecovirus (cellular line B) along with two other strains of flying mice.
At the full-genome level, it is 96 per cent identified by other models of the coronavirus of the fly mouse (BatCov RatG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in the amino acidity of certain parts of the follow-up to the gene of pangoline and human viruses.
The overall gender ratio today showed that the largest percentage (92 per cent) of pangolon virus is between the coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate stores of viruses.
The virus infection may be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although in the end it should be confirmed by analysis of a polymeric core reaction with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) of infected secret or computer Tomography.
The results of studies comparable to the PCR and CT methods used in Hughan have shown that KT is much more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions are similar to other pneumonia and disease-related processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or to test the first line in the COVID-19 diagnostic method”.
WHO published several RNA testing protocols on SARS-CoV-2 and the first of them was published on 17 January.
A polymeric core reaction test is carried out in real-time (RT-PCR).
It can be performed on respiratory tests and blood samples.
The results are usually ready for a period of several hours and several days.
The test is usually used as a bone marrow, although the bone marrow can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, none of them had been adequately qualified for universal application.
In the United States, a serial test developed by Cellex was approved for use in exceptional cases only by certified laboratories.
The characteristics of the symptoms of X-ray and computer Tomography (CT) are asymmetric peripheral disturbances by the type of stem cell and the absence of pleural fluids.
The Italian radiological society is involved in the development of an international picture of alleged violations.
Because of other infections such as adenovirus, when identified by COVID-19 images, not confirmed by PCR tests, there is a limited clinical specification.
A large study was conducted in China that compared the results of the CT breast cell and the testing of the PCR, and it was found that although the images were less specific in the case of infection, they could be encrypted faster; they were more sensitive and therefore could be considered as a screening tool in the affected areas.
In order to diagnose the virus using X-ray and computer Tomography, circuit neural networks have been developed on the basis of artificial intelligence.
The disease prevention strategies include the maintenance of a general personal hygiene, handwashing, the avoidance of eye contact, the nose or the shape of the hand, the use of a knife or the spread of a napkin that should be removed immediately after use.
Those who may have been infected should wear a medical mask in the public area.
In order to prevent the spread of disease, it is also recommended that people be physically separated from the public, that many Governments refrain from any immediate journey to the country and areas affected by outbreaks and restrict the movement of civilians.
Nevertheless, the virus could spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spread among the population, some members of whom are not aware of where and how it has been infected. Medical workers who are suspected of being infected are advised to use standard precautions and precautions when contacting other people and the means of protection of the eye.
The use of data on the location of citizens through their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about compliance with confidentiality, such as Amnesty International (International Amnesty), as well as more than 100 other organizations, with statements to limit this type of human observation.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use were developed and proposed; as of 7 April 2020, more than 10 expert groups were working on the development of decisions to ensure confidentiality of personal data, for example, the registration of users' access to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If the mobile phone user has been in close contact with the person whose COVID-19 test has been positive, he will receive the relevant notification. There are also false versions of how to prevent infection, such as nose and mouth, which is actually ineffective.
At this point, COVID-19 vaccines do not exist, although many organizations are working on it.
In order to prevent the spread of disease, it is recommended to wash your hands.
CDC (Center Control and Prevention of Diseases) also recommends more often washing hands with milk and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting toilets or during severe hand pollution, as well as in front of food, after drying, cough or coughing.
This is necessary because, in the presence of the human body, the virus is destroyed by a domestic virus that blinds its protective eye.
In addition, if flour and water are not available, CDC recommends the use of disincentives to treat hands on a spirit basis at least 60 per cent.
WHO recommends that people avoid injuries to their eyes, noses, or toes.
The surfaces may be affected by a number of solutions (at the surface of the running device, the disinfecting device starts to operate a minute after application) containing 62 to 71 per cent of ethanol, 50 to 100 per cent of iopropanol, 0.1 per cent of sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 per cent of hydrochloric acid and 0.2 to 7.5 per cent of iodine.
Other components, such as benzalconic chloride and gluconeate chloride, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, in the event of doubt about the COVID or its confirmation in the institution, such as the office or daily station, all the spaces of such premises, including cabinets, toilets, general use facilities, electronic equipment, such as plans, sensory screens, keyboards, remote control pools and ATMs used by sick people, be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend that the mouth and nose cover the back of the back of the bed or the ceiling and immediately extract the hygiene items used.
Those who may have been infected are advised to use medical masks, as the use of masks may limit the volume and range of output products that are air-induced in conversation, shingles and coughs.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Steven Griffin, a professor at the University of Lids, “the use of a medical mask can reduce people's exposure to their individuals, and the addiction to their hands is a major means of infection”.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, for example, for people who are treating COVID-19, although it also recognizes that using masks actually reduces the number of injuries to the person.
Several countries have begun to call for public health masks.
CDC centres, the United States, recommend wearing tissue masks for non-medical purposes. China has stressed the importance of using one-off medical masks for healthy people, especially if they are in close contact with other people (1 m (3 ft) or less).
In Hong Kong it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or in public places.
Health officials in Thailand invite people to make personal clothing masks in their home environments and to burn them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from entering the street without masks closing their nose and legs.
On 16 March, the Government of Viet Nam requested all citizens to wear masks in public places in order to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria has committed all visitors to the product stores to hope for medical masks.
The Government of Israel has also requested citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, in Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks were produced daily from mid-March, medical masks were prescribed for all passengers on travel and on international buses.
In Panama, residents are required to wear a medical mask on the street; therefore, it was recommended that people who cannot afford a mask should be put on their own under domestic conditions.
Medical masks are also widely used by the inhabitants of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is a measure to combat infection aimed at slowing the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Protection measures include quarantines, travel restrictions, school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can use social isolation measures, staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding people’s places, using uncontacted greetings and physically distance from others.
Many of the Governments of the regions, especially those who have suffered from drought, are currently either prescribing or recommending social isolation.
The maximum number of people who could be gathered in one place according to the recommendations of the United States Government and health organizations was rapidly reduced, ranging from 250 (in regions where there were no COVID-19) to 50, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibited the collection of groups involving more than two people. Older people and persons suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertonia and weakened immune system are at increased risk of serious infection. CDC recommended that they stay home if the outbreak of disease occurs in the region. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began to replace the term “social distance” with “physical distance” as a result of the use of the term “responsibility”, thus setting out the purpose of this approach, which is to draw up a set of measures for this purpose.
The use of the term “social isolation” was understood to mean that people should be completely isolated, rather than remaining in contact with other people in alternative ways. Some agencies have published guidelines on sexual health that should be used during the pandemic.
Among other things, it has been recommended that only your permanent partners with whom you live and that you are convinced that there is no virus and its symptoms.
Individuals with diagnosis COVID-19 and those who suspect that they are infected are recommended for self-insolation under domestic conditions.
Health institutions have published detailed self-sustainment instructions, and many governments have also imposed obligations or recommended that all affected areas themselves be placed on quarantine.
Persons at high risk groups had a higher quarantine rate.
Persons who may have been in contact with COVID-19 infected or recently visited a country or region, in a significant extent affected by the epidemic, have been advised to be on quarantine within 14 days of the last possible contact.
Emergency strategies include preventing, suppressing or mitigating the spread of disease.
The prevention of the spread of disease is in early stages and is intended to monitor and isolate infected persons, as well as to include other measures to control infection and vaccines in order to stop spreading disease among the rest of the population.
At a time when the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to mitigate the effects: measures are being taken to mitigate the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on the health and social system.
Measures to prevent and mitigate the effects of the spread of disease may be taken simultaneously.
The outbreak requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic, with the basic number of cases of infection below 1. Part of the emergency management effort is aimed at lowering the epidemic peak known as epidemiological bleeding.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overloading health services and provide more time for the development of vaccines and treatment methods.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help to cope with shock include personal prevention, such as healthy hands, use of medical masks and self-sustainment; public measures aimed at physical isolation, such as closing schools and eliminating mass activities; community involvement in the promotion of such measures and participation; and environmental protection measures such as surface clearance; after the more serious outbreaks were made in China, there were more serious actions aimed at preventing seizures, such as closures of cities.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at restricting the spread of viruses.
In South Korea, mass screenings and localized quarantines have been introduced, as well as the work of the information system on the movement of infected persons.
In Singapore, financial support was provided for infected persons on self-insolation and imposed large taxes on those who did not.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks and gravitational tapes has increased, and the United Kingdom and the United States modeling has shown that there are serious problems with mitigation (sustaining but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and stress (sustaining the growth of the epidemic).
The optimal policy to mitigate the effects of the spread of disease can reduce the peak load on the health system by 2/3, and mortality is double, but still leads to hundreds of thousands of deaths and collisions of health systems.
The injection may be preferable, but it should be used until the virus is circling among the population (or until the vaccine is developed if it occurs earlier) as the spread of the disease will be restored rapidly when measures will be weakened.
Long-term intervention to put the pandemic in place leads to social and economic costs.
Antiviral preparations approved for treatment with COVID-19 are not currently available, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing of existing preparations.
Taking non-receptive medicines from the mouth, drinking sufficient fluids and rest may help alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the patient's illness, oxygen therapy, internal fluid intake and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids can only harm.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also reported that some “traditional and domestic resources” could facilitate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO considers improving the capacity and adaptation of health to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a major response to the outbreak of disease.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health care services to help redistribution of resources at several levels, including the focus of laboratory testing on COVID-19, the elimination of immediate procedures where possible, the detection and isolation of patients with approved COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as the expansion of intensive therapy by training and increasing the number of available HIV/AIDS devices.
There are different theories about where the first case of infection could occur — the so-called ‘noble patient’.
The first reported outbreak of a new coronary infection was likely to take place on 1 December 2019 in the city of Hubai Province, China.
During the month, the number of cases of coronary infection in the province of Hobbey was gradually increased.
They were mainly linked to the optimum market of Huananian marine products, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus has spread into the human organism of one of these animals; in other words, the virus has a zone origin. On 26 December in the province of Hobbey, the case of massive pneumonia of unknown origin was recorded by Dr. Zjan Tanazin, reporting on this case in the Center for the Control and Prevention of the Disease in the City of Shanghai on 27 December.
On 30 December, the medical team of the city’s central clinic warned its colleagues about “coronavirus similar to SARS”.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Venlan, were warned by the police about the responsibility for spreading lies, and Dr. Ay Fen received an answer from his superiors for the panic.
Later, on 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission published a public notification and informed WHO of the situation.
The Hughan health authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which had been greater enough to initiate the investigation in early January, and at early stages, the number of cases had doubled about every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread in other Chinese provinces, which contributed to the Chinese New Year’s Festivals and the fact that Hughan was a transport and a major railway failure.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new cases of infection in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Schengen.
According to later official data, by 20 January 2020, 6,174 people had been infected by the disease; as of 26 March, China and Italy had reported the highest number of reported injuries in the world; more than 1,61 million had been reported worldwide on 9 April 2020, more than 97,000 had been killed and more than 364,000 had been cured.
About 200 countries and territories had at least one registered offence.
Because of the pandemic, many European countries in the Schengen area have limited their freedom of movement and have established border controls.
National response measures included measures to prevent the spread of disease, such as quarantine (known as mandatory housing, house-to-house or isolation), as well as time-limited. As of 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the United States's population, were in some form quarantine, more than 50 million people were on the islands of the Philippines, about 59 million people were on the island of South Africa and 1.3 billion people — in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later that figure grew to 2.6 billion people — about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 disease was registered in Hughan on 1 December 2019; according to another report, the reliability of the information was not verified on 17 November.
On 26 December, Czysin's doctor worked with the case of a massive pneumonia disease of an unknown type, and on 27 December her clinic informed the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the city of Ohanh.
The initial genetic testing of patients' samples, held on 27 December 2019, showed the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
On 31 December, the Hughana Municipal Health Commission issued a relevant public notice.
WHO was notified on the same day.
With regard to such notifications, the police had warned doctors in Hughan about the responsibility for the “sustaining of hearings” of the outbreak.
The National Commission for Health in China initially claimed that there was no “public evidence” of the ability to re-discovered virus to transfer from human to human.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign to curb the spread of the virus, later referred to by the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Si Cisin ' s National War.
The events of “the same large-scale quarantine in the history of humanity”, on 23 January, had been announced on the Sanitary Cordona and on the ban of entry into the Ocean and, on the other hand, the measure had subsequently spread to a total of 15 cities in the province of Hobbey and affected about 57 million people in total.
In the city, the use of personal transportation was prohibited.
In many places the New Year's celebration was cancelled (January 25th).
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital in Hoshüşan, which was completed in 10 days.
A second hospital was subsequently built, Leyschüşan, which was adopted by other progressive patients.
In addition to the newly built Chinese hospitals, 14 other institutions in the Hughan, such as conference centres and stadiums, have also re-financed temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government took additional measures to halt the outbreak of COVID-19, including the release of health reports for travellers and the extension of the New Year ' s holiday period.
University and schools were closed throughout the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have taken a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In a number of regions, the Chinese authorities have introduced a remote working regime.
In the province of Hobbey and beyond, travel restrictions were imposed.
Public transport work schedules have been changed, and museums throughout China have been temporarily closed.
In many cities, a movement control regime was introduced, and some 760 million people (more than half the population) were considered to have been confronted with some form of air-borne restrictions, and after a global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the “import” virus from other countries.
For example, 14-day compulsory quarantines were introduced in Beijing for all international passengers entering the city, and as a matter of 23 March in China, only one case of transmission of infection within the country that occurred five days earlier was recorded in this case from the person returning to Guanchoro from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, China's Prime Minister Lee Ketten reported that the spread of disease in the country had been largely halted and the outbreak in China had been controlled.
On the same day the restrictions on travel to Hobbey, other than Huhanya, were lifted, which occurred two months after the closure of the province of Karantin. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that on 28 March the entry for persons with a visa or type of residence would be suspended.
Those wishing to come to China should make applications for visas in Chinese missions or consultations.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government invited businesses and factories to resume their work and provided companies with a package of financial and credit incentives. On 4 April, a national three-minute silence “minute of silence” was held, which opened the day of the tragedy on the victims of Coronavirus, announced by the State Council and associated with the holiday of Quinn, but the central government requested a citizen to pay tribute to the deceased online, in accordance with physical distance to avoid the recurrence of COVID-19.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have been deployed to the territory of South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases of disease, which took place because there was a large number of followers of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shinchong.
The Shinchongi investigators arrived in Tagu from Ohanya, which is apparently a source of shock.
As of 22 February, 1,261 (about 13 per cent) of the 9 336 followers of the church reported their symptoms of illness. The highest level of anxiety was announced in South Korea on 23 February 2020.
More than 2,000 confirmed injuries have been recorded in Korea on 28 February, and the rate has risen to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases were placed on quarantine after three soldiers had been confirmed by the virus.
As a result, the travel schedule for airlines has been changed, and South Korea has launched a program for the screening of the population on the presence of viruses, tracking contacts and organizing quarantine measures for persons with disabilities, which is considered to be the largest and best in the world's view of its organization.
The screening methods included mandatory information on their symptoms through the mobile application of all visitors from abroad, criminal testing of the virus, which has already been prepared the following day, as well as increased testing opportunities that have allowed up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
The South Korean programme is considered successful in combating the outbreak of disease, despite the fact that the entire city has not been isolated.
Many Koreans have signed requests that have been endorsed by the President, or have called upon Mr. Munu to make an impression that the Government's response to the outbreak of the disease is inadequate.
On 23 March, it was reported that the lowest number of cases of torture in South Korea had been recorded within four weeks.

The first measures introduced by the Government included the abolition of concerts and other cultural and sports activities, Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has distributed five trillion rials to combat the virus.
President Hassan Ruhani stated on 26 February 2020 that the Government is not planning to subsidize quarantines throughout the affected areas, but only individuals will be placed on quarantine.
In March, plans to limit international travel had been announced, but intense movement between cities prior to the New Year of the Persian year continued.
The Shiite shrines in Kume remained open for palm trees until 16 March 2020, and Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China in February.
On 28 February, more than 10 countries reported cases of outbreaks with Iran, indicating that there could be more than 388 cases recorded by the Iranian Government.
The Iranian Parliament was closed and 23 of its 290 members, as reported on 3 March, the virus testing results were positive.
On 12 March, Human Rights Wotch (“On Human Rights Protection”) called on the Iranian prison leadership to release human rights defenders who were detained for the sake of peace, as well as to temporarily release all prisoners eligible for this category.
The organization states that there is an increased risk of the spread of viruses in closed institutions, such as prisons where there is insufficient medical assistance.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths in one day — the largest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak.
By 17 March, at least 12 active or former Iranian policies and government officials had been eliminated.
As of March 23, 50 new cases of coronary disease were recorded in Iran each time, and every ten minutes — one new death from the coronary virus.
According to the WHO representative, the level of disease in Iran may be five times higher than that reported at the official level.
It is also assumed that US sanctions against Iran could affect the country ' s financial capacity to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights required the freezing of economic sanctions against countries most affected by pandemics, including Iran.
On 31 January, it was confirmed that the disease had fallen to Italy when two Chinese tourists tested SARS-CoV-2 in Rome had a positive result.
The number of cases of injury has grown sharply, which has prompted the Government of Italy to stop all flights to China and China and to announce emergency situations.
A non-accompanied class of COVID-19 was later discovered. It all started with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardi on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree on the detention of torture, whereby more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were placed in quarantine.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: "Entering the disease emergency zone and leaving it will be covered.
In those areas, it was already ordered to stop business and cancel sports activities.” On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered that all schools and universities be closed throughout the country, as 100 deaths had already been fixed in Italy at the time.
All major sports activities, including the A football matches, had to be held outside the closed doors by April, but all sports activities had been postponed for at least one month by 9 March.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte arranged to stop almost all commercial activities and close businesses with the exception of supermarkets and appetizers.

As at 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases of coronary infection, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 health cases, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardi region.
One CNN report notes that this high level of mortality in Italy can contribute to the combination of two factors — the large number of elderly citizens in that country and the lack of access to information on those who are more chronically ill today.
The United Kingdom responded to the virus most peacefully from all affected countries, and by 18 March 2020, the British Government did not oblige citizens to comply with any form of social isolation or quarantine measures.
As a result, the Government was criticized for the lack of rapid and serious response to the threat posed by the people of the country. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement recommending that all travel and social contacts be avoided without priority, offering people to work from home and avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment facilities, such as pubs and sports clubs, should be closed as soon as possible, and promised workers to pay up to 80 per cent of their salary, but not more than 2,500 pounds per month as measures to support the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced that there were more social-distance measures, preventing more than two people from gathering and restricting the travel and active air-flows only with extreme needs.
In contrast with the previous measures, these restrictions were imposed by the involvement of the police, the introduction of taxes and the spread of people.
Most companies were required to close, except those that provide “people’s vulnerability”, including supermarkets, appetizers, banks, economic stores, auto repair stations and garages.

Nevertheless, the testing of the population in the United States has not begun immediately, and the actual outbreaks of the disease have been hidden during this period.
The testing was difficult because of the absence of tests issued by the Federal Government in February, by the end of February of the federal government's authorization to use non-State testing sets developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics, as well as restrictive criteria prior to the beginning of March that would allow citizens to undergo testing (this could only be done only on the appointment of a medical doctor).
The Washington Post reported that less than 4,000 tests were conducted in the United States on 27 February.
The Atlantic reported that less than 14,000 tests were conducted on 13 March.

WHO noted the clear differences between the situation with the outbreak of atypical pneumonia, which took place between 2002 and 2004, during which the Chinese authorities were accused of sensitizing information that was preventing the prevention of disease and the prevention of its spread, on the one hand, and the current crisis when the central government “regularly provided updated information on the situation in order to prevent panic attacks on the Chinese New Year”.
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to prohibit the movement of transport in Hughan, the representative of WHO Goden Galea noted that, although “this measure was specifically recommended not for WHO”, it was also “an important confirmation of the implementation of the obligation to prevent the epidemic in the most widespread place”, and called it “unprecedented in public health history”. 30 January, after the possibility of human transmission to China and the increase in number of infected countries in other countries was confirmed.
WHO Director-General, Mr. Tedros Adan, said that the PHEIC declaration was due to “a risk of global distribution, especially in low and medium-income countries with no reliable health systems.
Commenting on the restrictions on travel, Mr. Tedros stated that “there is no reason for measures that are too restrictive against international movements and trade”, and that “WOC does not recommend restricting trade and movement”.

Mr. Tedros also stated that “the indicator of our readiness is to be prepared for the epidemic of our own weakness”, and called on the international community to “select: invest today or pay in the future”. At the press conference held on 11 February, WHO established the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
On that same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterrich agreed to provide “the capacity of the entire United Nations system to respond to the problem”.
As a result, the UN Panel on Crisis Management coordinated all United Nations response measures, which, according to WHO, will allow “to focus on health response, while other agencies can use their experience to combat the outbreak of disease in a broader social and economic plan”.
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated the establishment of a joint special group, which provided international experts and WHO staff on the ground in China to assist in addressing the situation within the country and to assess “the severity of disease and infection”, organized seminars and meetings with leading national agencies, as well as on site to assess “Effective response measures at the provincial and rural levels, including urban and rural areas”. On 25 February the WHO said that “the world should do more to prepare for the potential pandemic, and to assess the severity of the disease and its vulnerability”, he noted that “the country is still in need of more response than ever before”.
When the outbreak broke out in Iran, WHO sent a joint group to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the likelihood of global spread of coral virus would be increased from “high” to “high” to “high” – the highest level of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Emergency Health Programme, warned in his statement: “This is a check by every Government on the planet on the basis of a real situation: to act.
This virus may already be on your way to your country, and you need to be ready, and it also stressed that the correct response can help the world avoid the “missing scenario for events”.
Ryan also stated that the current data was not a basis for declaring the global pandemic to officials in the field of public health, and added that the pandemic declaration would mean that “we are actually acknowledging that every person on the planet would be at risk of being infected with this virus”.
On 11 March, WHO announced the outbreak of coronary pneumonia.
The Director-General of WHO stated that WHO is “deeply concerned at both the high level of spread and the severity of the disease and at least the alarming level of non-effects on this issue”. WHO is critical of the view of an inadequate approach to the understanding of the pandemic, including the subsequent announcement of the emergency situation in the field of public health and the classification of viruses as pandemics.
Mr. Tedros Adanoma, the Director General of WHO, responded to a negative response to the situation, was asked to withdraw 733,000 persons on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, ten UN human rights experts stressed the importance of respecting the rights of every human being during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone had the right to apply life-saving measures to him and that the Government was responsible for the organization of such measures.
The Panel stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should not at all serve as a justification for discrimination against any particular group of people.
The experts stressed that everyone had the right to health, including persons with limited means, representatives of minority groups, elderly citizens, internally displaced persons, homeless people, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other disadvantaged groups in need of public support.
International government organizations consider the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The organization of economic cooperation and development has established a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as information and recommendations.
The digital clock contains information on the political measures of various countries (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health and the world economy, address the effects of quarantine and travel restrictions in order to help countries learn from one another and promote coordinated global responses to the fight against coral virus.
The Government of China has been criticised by the United States, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Michael Goova and Eduardo Bolsonar, the son of President Jaira Bolsonar of Brazil, for the anti-pandemi action that began with the Chinese province of Hobby.
A number of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CCD) levels of provinces were released for the quarantine measures they had taken in the central part of China, and these exemptions were evidence of a failure to respond to the political instability in the region.
Some commentators believe that this step was aimed at protecting the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China, Si Cisin, from the anger of the public over the outbreak of the crown virus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lizzian, have disagreed with an earlier statement that the outbreak of the crown virus began in Huhana, but have taken sides in the theory of the conspiracy that the COVID-19 is originating in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. President Donald Trumpa called the crown virus “Chinese virus” or “Uhanya virus”, saying that “Cenzura in China only improves the situation with the virus that has now become a global pandemic”, and this statement has been criticised by some commentators who claim that this approach is a racist approach and “reduced from the inability of the U.S. President to prevent the spread of disease”.
The Daily Beast has access to the U.S. government telegram, which contains the communication strategic speed, as is apparent from the National Security Council; at this point there are references to the strategy: “All cases in China.
We are asked to disseminate this information in any way possible, including press conferences and television lectures." Such organizations as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg said that China's efforts to help countries suffering from the virus are part of the “propagandist effort” to achieve global impact.
The Head of the EU Foreign Policy Bureau Joseph Borrell warned of the presence of “a geopolitical component that includes the fight against peer influence and so-called generosity policy”.
Borrell also said that "China is constantly promoting the idea of its role as a responsible and trusted partner, unlike the United States."
China also called on the United States to abolish sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while some reports indicate that assistance was being provided in the last two countries.
The sacrifice of Jacob Ma, 100,000 health masks, Cuba, fell under ban in connection with the United States sanctions imposed on 3 April.
The United States authorities are also accused of transferring the aid intended for other countries to their own country.
There have also been disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has allocated hundreds of IVL equipment intended for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian Government had criticized the lack of support from the European Union regarding the infection of Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Ambassador of Italy to the EU, said that "China only responded bilaterally.
This does not necessarily prove European solidarity.”
On 22 March, following a telephone interview with Prime Minister Josephe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin organized a shipment to Italy of Russian military sanatoriums, specializing in disinfection transport and other medical equipment.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous “political high level” as claiming that 80 per cent of Russian aid was “valueless or little useful for Italy”.
The source accused Russia of attempting to exert a positive influence on the world community at the “goopolitical and diplomatic” level.
President Lombardi Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Mayo rejected the attacks on the media and expressed their gratitude for the assistance.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical assistance to the United States.
Press Secretary Cremland Dmitry Peskov stated that “by providing assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American medical equipment and materials producers are in the process of production, they will also be able to provide a response if necessary”.
NATO Defence 2020 military training, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, the largest NATO military training after the end of the cold war, will be carried out in a reduced format.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, described the training of Defender 2020 (Protector-2020): “In a crisis that has taken place today in the field of public health, the implementation of these lessons poses a threat not only to the United States and many European parties, but also to the inhabitants of the countries where such activities should be carried out.” The Government of Iran has been seriously affected by the virus, and it has been infected by about two dozen members of the parliament as well as five other current or former political actors.
On 14 March 2020, Iran President Hassan Ruhani addressed the world leaders in an open letter asking for assistance, reporting that his country was experiencing difficulties in combating the lack of access to the international market in relation to sanctions imposed against Iran. The epidemic brought appeals to the United States for the adoption of social policy, which was distributed in other developing countries, including the introduction of a single health system and care system for children paid for family leave and increased public health funding.
Politicians expected that this could adversely affect Donald Trampa's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential elections, and the pandemic had eroded diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.
South Korea has criticized Japan ' s “unmarked and passive quarantine measures” after Japan declared that any citizen coming from South Korea will be placed on a two-week quarantine in specialized locations.
South Korean society was divided significantly because of President Mun Jae-ina's reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed requests that were either endorsed by the President or called upon Mr. Munu to make an impression that the Government's response to the outbreak of the disease was inadequate, and the pandemic forced countries to adopt emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators are concerned that this step would enable Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, the Parliament voted to grant Prime Minister Victor Orban the right to rule without delay through orders, to suspend Parliament's work, as well as to make elections and to punish those who will be accused of spreading false information about the virus and government measures to combat the crisis.
Coronavirus outbreaks have been called a number of cases of supply deficits with regard to the global increase in the use of equipment to combat epidemics, the purchase of goods under panic and the collapse of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Department of Food and Drug Control has issued a warning of lack of medicines and medical equipment, resulting in increased consumer demand and problems with suppliers.
There were also panic procurement in several public places, which led to the loss of first-time supplies, such as food products, toilet books and bottled water, which, in turn, led to the loss of stocks.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanoma, the demand for individual protection has grown 100 times.
This leap has led to a double-fold increase in prices compared with the usual price, as well as delays in delivery of medical supplies for four to six months.
It also called for a lack of resources for individual protection worldwide, and WHO warned that health workers would be affected by this.
In Australia, due to the pandemic, the system buyers had a new opportunity to sell Australian goods in China.
This activity led to a lack of child food in some supermarkets and was subsequently prohibited by the Government of Australia, despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Huhan region, and the high demand for food, both areas were able to avoid severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation of stocks and illicit trade by critically important products that have been successful have helped to prevent the sharp food shortages expected in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, which has small agricultural production, has not experienced significant declines, but it is believed that industry representatives believe that prices for agricultural production can grow.
Several food stores remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Hughan, while China's government officials provided dog stocks to provide adequate food for the population.
Similar laws, which require food producers to keep food stocks in emergency situations, exist in Italy.
The damage suffered by the world economy was reflected in China: According to the media on 16 March, China's economy suffered a severe injury in the first two months of 2020 due to measures to combat the spread of the virus taken by the Government, resulting in a 20.5 per cent decrease in sales volume.
China is a major economic and productive centre, which is therefore considered to be a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
According to Agate Demari, a member of the Economist Intelligence Unit, market flexibility will remain until there is a clearer picture of potential outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts believed that the economic consequences of the current epidemic of global growth could affect the epidemiological epidemics for the years 2002-2004.
According to one estimate made by an expert from the University of Washington, St. Louis, the world supply gap could exceed $300 billion and the negative impact could last for two years.
It is reported that the oil exporters' Organization (OPEC) has begun to take “serious measures” after a sharp reduction in oil prices due to demand from China.
On 24 February, the world funds markets fell because of a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside China.
On 27 February, due to increasing threats to the outbreak of coronavirus, the various funds indexes of the United States, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 index and the Dou-Johns index for industrial companies' actions showed the most recent decline since 2008, with the Dou index at 1191, the largest one-day fall after the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indexes showed more than 10 per cent fall.
On 28 February, the Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating but maintained a negative forecast.
The actions were rebounded because of the threats to the spread of cornavirus, and the most serious fall occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is a likelihood of economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian commended the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks respond faster than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors with regard to the movement bans, the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and the Government ' s recommendations that no travel be undertaken.
As a result of all these measures, many airlines have abandoned flights due to a sharp reduction in aircraft demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Kandas, and the British regional airline Flybe has ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise line industry has never been strong.
A number of railway stations and ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chung-yung, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year's celebrations.
National and regional Governments have abolished a number of activities involving large numbers of people, including the annual annual festivals; private companies have also closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many new-year activities have been cancelled and tourist attractions have been closed in order to prevent mass massacres; for example, in Beijing, the prohibited city has been closed and traditional temple lamps have been removed.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and areas of China, the authorities extended the new annual Canyon until 10 February, indicating that the majority of enterprises were not open until that date.
There were 80 per cent of GDP in these regions and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong authorities have raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and have announced an emergency situation, closed school by March, and cancelled the New Year's celebration.
A 40 per cent decline in the travel point of trade in Europe and Latin America.
In North America and the Middle East, retail companies reduced sales by 50 to 60 per cent.
As a result, in March, the presence of commercial centres fell from 33 to 43 per cent compared with February.
Trade centres around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improving health conditions, setting up facilities to check visitors' temperature and cancel activities. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession in Latin America, caused by pandemic, can be reduced to 14-22 million more people than it would have been in the same situation, but without pandemics.
In January and February 2020, in the outbreak of the epidemic in Hughan, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and turned to the Government for help.
According to the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, an increase of 47 million people in the United States may be unemployed, and the unemployment rate may reach 32 per cent. The self-insulation measures introduced in India leave ten million Indian migrant workers paid daily. A study conducted by the Institute of Angus Reida showed that 44 per cent of Canadian households have suffered from unemployment or otherwise. Almost 900,000 Spanish workers have also lost jobs since the 20th anniversary of the 20th anniversary of the earthquake in Spain.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers responded to a single social payment, and nearly half a million companies in Germany transferred their staff to the government-subsidized government ' s reduced working schedule — a day of lack of work.
The German working day pay scheme was also introduced in France and Great Britain.
The fields of art and cultural heritage have also suffered greatly from the pandemic, which has affected the activities of organizations as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, throughout the world.
Cultural and Cultural Organizations have tried to support their (often funded by a State) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society by ensuring the safety of their staff and the public and, as far as possible, by supporting the people of art.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions were closed throughout the world for an unlimited period of time or access to them, and exhibitions, events and presentations were cancelled or transferred to other dates.
There was an active effort to provide alternative services through digital platforms, and yet another recent and ongoing traffic has been affected by the spread of the virus — the abolition of religious services, large sports events and other public activities such as musical festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion exhibitions.
The Vatican announced the abolition of the Easter Week in Rome, which took place in the last week of the Christian period — the Grand Post.
Many Europeans recommend that older Christians stay home and do not visit services after the resurrection; in some churches, church services began to be broadcast over radio, e - mail, or television, while the leaders of some churches offer to perform public service.
The Roman Catholic Church closed to visit its churches, churches, shrines and shrines of St. Peter, where there were no more Christian temples, and later other religious organizations also abandoned services and restricted access to public services in churches, synagogues, synagogues, temples and shrines.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the abolition of five prayers in areas affected by the outbreak of Coronavirus, while the saints were later closed; Saudi Arabia prohibited the access of foreign peasants and their inhabitants to the sacred places of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sports events since World War II.
Most major sports activities have been cancelled or transferred, including the WEFA 2019-20 Championships League, the Prime Minister 2019-20, Euro-2020 WEFA, the 2019-20 NBA season and the NHL 2019-20 season.
The crown virus also destroyed plans for the 20th Summer Olympic Games, which were to be launched at the end of July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be “transmitted to the post-2020, but not later than the summer of 2021”.
This has resulted in a significant increase in the number of new subscribers, and the entertainment industry has also been affected by the fact that different musical groups have stopped or cancelled concerts.
Many large theaters, such as the shipyards, have also abandoned all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional offline activities, some artists and musicians have been able to explore options to continue their activities and exchange their results on the Internet, organize live online concerts or websites; this helps creative people to continue to perform, perform or publish their productions.
The network has seen a number of Internet memes on the topic of coronavirus, many of which are horoscopes and reflect worrying attitudes that are characteristic of periods of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 appearance, there has been a marked increase in preoccupation, xenophobia and racism in relation to Chinese and people of East Asia, as well as to the people of Europe, the United States and other countries.
The causes of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
In the February briefings (when most cases of injury were still limited in China) the racist attitudes expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who had both deserved the virus or received a fair compensation for anything.
In some African countries, there is also an increase in anti-Chinan attitudes.
Many of the people of Ohanya and Hobeya reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
The citizens of China, as well as their inhabitants living in affected areas, were supported both online and online.
The epidemic has begun to spread in new countries, in particular in Italy, the first country in Europe faced with a serious outbreak of COVID-19; in this respect, these regions can also begin to feel the impact of suspicion and xenophobia, such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea at an early stage of the petition to prevent China's citizens from entering their countries with a view to preventing the epidemic.
In Japan, #ChineseDontComeToJapan has taken leadership positions in Twitter.
China's citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States, report on the growing level of racist attitudes and even attacks.
U.S. President Donald Tramp met with criticism that he called the crown virus “China virus”; critics considered this to be racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protests against buses transported to the New Singapore by Ukrainian and foreign nationals evacuated from Ohanya.
Students arriving from the border with China, North-East India, and trained in major cities of India reported cases of persecution related to the outbreak of Coronavirus.
Dilip Ghoš, president of the State Party of Bwartia Jananta, West Bengali, stated that the Chinese destroyed nature and "that is why God rejected them."
Later, these statements were condemned by the Chinese council in Calcutta, which called their "disgusting". In China, because of the pandemic, Xenophobic and racism were re-examined with non-Chinan citizens: foreigners became referred to as a "foreign muse" and objects worthy of "utilization".
Many newspapers with access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all areas affected by the virus.
Many scientists have published their scientific articles on the outbreak of corona virus in open access.
Some scientists have decided to provide short-term access to the results of their studies on print servers such as bioRxiv.

The laboratory testing of the 2019 Respiratory Coronavirus (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and methods of detection of antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by the OT-PCR, which recognises the RNC coronavirus.
This test is specific and is intended only to detect SARS-CoV-2.
It is used to confirm sufficiently recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used both for diagnostics and for population control.
Analytics indicate the number of people who have been infected, including those who have been too poor to deal with in the hospital or who have not been at all.
The exact level of mortality from this disease and collective immunity can be determined as a result of this test.
As of March 2020, there was no reliable data on the spread of the virus among the population due to limited testing opportunities.
By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and the number of tests carried out in various countries was very contradictory.
Such differences in data are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates that can be significantly exceeded in some countries.
A test may be carried out using a polymeric core response of a real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) test using different respiratory pathways, including bone marrow or molluscs.
The results are usually available for a period of up to 2 days.
OT-PCR test carried out on the bones taken from the throat is effective only during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear from the throat, but it continues to multiply in ease.
In infected patients tested on the second week of the disease, alternative substances may be taken from the lower respiratory tract using a cooling catalytic cataract or may be used for decarcination (mocrine).
One of the early PCR tests was developed at the Sharite Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020, using a polymeric core reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) and was based on 250,000 packages that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As of 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenbiotech developed a set to detect SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of the clinical level CPC (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
It identifies the gene “E”, common to all beta-coron viruses, and the gene RdRp, which is specific to SARS-CoV-2. China's BGI Group has become one of the first companies to be authorized by the National Drug Management Authority of China for the extra-use of SARS-CoV-2 based on the CDC. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are disseminated through the organization of the International Reagent Resource to carry out the RT-PCR in real time (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel in public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests from older versions of the test sets produced incomplete results due to married reactors and the dry test area of CDC in Atlanta, resulting in an average of less than 100 tests per day during February 2020.
The two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020 and only after that date were allowed to be tested by public and local laboratories.
The testing was approved by the Office for the Monitoring of the Quality of Food Products and Medicines in the framework of an external application authorisation.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing COVID-19 infection on the basis of RT-PCR throughout the country.
Quest Diagnostics began testing at COVID-19 throughout the country from 9 March 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been made; the collection and processing of analyses must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia a COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Centre for Viruses and Biotechnology.
The test was registered by the Federal Health Authority on 11 February 2020. It was reported that on 12 March 2020, Mayo’s client developed a test to detect COVID-19. On 13 March 2020 Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test, which could be conducted within 3.5 hours of a large test, allowing one vehicle to process approximately 4128 tests for 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted exclusive authorisation to Abbott laboratories for the testing of Abbott m2000; earlier FDA issued a similar authorisation for Hological, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepidhe also receives USA from the FDA for about 45 minutes.
The FDA has also approved a test using the technology for the amplification of isothermal nuclear acids instead of the PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of cycles of ambient temperatures, this method can detect positive results in five minutes and negative in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests a day. At present, a test is being developed in Taiwan with a monoclonal antibodies specifically linked to the new nucleop acid white (N-white) crown virus, and there is hope that results will be obtained within 15-20 minutes, such as a flu test.
A review of the specialized literature in March 2020 concluded that “the X-ray of the breast cell has a small diagnostic value at early stages, while the results of the CT [computer Tomography] may be of such value even before symptoms occur”.
The typical features identified during the CT include the two-dimensional multi-dimensional sub-pleural performance focuss of the matte glass type with peripheral, asymmetric and aposterior distribution.
Subpletive domineering, the symptoms of bulimia and consolidation are being developed as the disease progresses.
The results of studies comparable to the PCR and CT methods used in Huhan at the time of the current pandemic have shown that CT is much more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions are compatible with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or to test the first line in the COVID-19 diagnostic method”. As of March 2020, CDC recommends using the CPC method.
The partial immune response to infection is expressed in the preparation of an antidote, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in humans after 7 days of symptoms, to determine immunity and to control population.
In many clinical laboratories, these analyses will be able to perform high-producing automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each system.
CLT usually uses one peripheral blood sample, although serious samples may also be used to monitor immune response.
In PoCT, one sample of blood is usually obtained by passing through each envelope.
Unlike the PCR methods, no blood collection phase is required for sampling. On 26 March 2020, the FDA referred to 29 organizations that have passed all the necessary registration procedures and can now distribute their tests on the antibodies.
As of 7 April 2020, the FDA approved only one test for the use of an external authorisation. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics obtained European authorisations for the use of their test kits, which can be found in the samples of IgG and IgA antibodies capable of fighting the virus.
The productivity of testing consists of several hundred samples over a few hours, and therefore this method works much faster than the normal PCR-analysis of the viral RNA.
The antibodies can usually be detected within 14 days of infection, and in early April, Britain found that none of the collections it acquired to analyse the antibodies were satisfactory.
In Hong Kong, a scheme was developed that allows patients with suspected virus to stay at home: “the emergency relief department sends the patient a sample sample,” the patient floats back, and sometimes receives test results. The British NHS announced the launch of its pilot test of suspected cases under domestic conditions that removes the risk of injury to other patients, or the need to dissipate the machine if it was used for the patient’s transport. In the case of a COVID-19 test, the test case was considered.
On 2 March, the National Medical Medical Association in Germany said that it was ready to carry out approximately 12,000 tests per day in ambulance conditions, and only 10,700 tests per week could be performed on Sundays.
If the investigation is directed to a doctor, the costs are covered by medical insurance.
According to President Robert Koha, Germany's overall productivity for testing consists of 160,000 tests per week.
As at 19 March, several large cities were proposed to be tested.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests in Germany was unknown as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that according to the calendar week 12/2020 at SARS-CoV-2, at least 483,295 analyses were carried out until Sunday 12/2020, including 33 491 samples (6.9%) were positive. Israeli researchers Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested the method of simultaneous testing of samples taken in 64 patients, combined samples and performed further analysis only if the combined model showed positive results. In the case of 5 February 2020, BGI’s 10th edition was opened for the period of laboratory testing.
The construction of the laboratory was organized by the founder of BGI Van Zian and completed in 5 days; the model showed that, if the laboratory was not implemented at such a rapid rate, the cases of disease in Dubai would be 47 per cent higher and, respectively, the costs of quarantine would also be twice as high.
Immediately after the opening of the laboratory in Hughan, Huo-Yan's laboratory was opened in Shanghai, Thailand, Beijing and Shanghai, in the 12 cities of China.
Up to 4 March 2020, the daily overall performance indicators were 50,000 tests per day. A multi-plex Origami Assays scheme was opened, which could test up to 1,122 patients with only 93 tests using COVID19. Such balanced structures could be used in small laboratories, except for the use of robotic fluid manipulators.
In March, due to the lack of and insufficient number of reactors, mass testing in the EU, Great Britain and the United States became a problem.
As a result, some authors have referred to test samples protocols, which provide for the burning of samples at 98°C (208°F) within 5 minutes to release RNC genes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the level of testing on the coronavirus currently carried out by the United Arab Emirates on the soul of the population exceeds the indicators of any other country, and that most of the population will soon be tested.
This was due to the possibility of experimentation, along with the acquisition by Group 42 and BGI of the laboratory for mass testing of the population (based on their laboratory for emergency detection of Huo-Yan in China).
This laboratory, which was launched in 14 days, is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests every day and is the first in the world to be so large a laboratory operating outside China.
Various testing options for various parts of the genetic profile of Coronavirus were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted a German version of testing kits that are sent to low-income countries with no resources to develop their own.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol, developed by the United States Sanitary and Epidemiological Centres, was not available until 28 January, which led to the absence of testing teams in the United States. In fact, in China and the United States, there were problems with confidence in testing teams, and those countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient amounts of health experts.
And here in South Korea, as experts say, extensive testing has helped to reduce the spread of a new corona virus.
For several years, the Government of South Korea has been working on the possibility of testing, mainly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the development of testing programmes as a better way of slowing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the increased demand for testing resulting from the rapid spread of the virus, many United States private laboratories, with hundreds of thousands of samples of analysis, were overloaded, and the storage of fat and chemical agents was rapidly restored.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The U.S. testing sets developed by CDC were “missing” and therefore the Government removed bureaucratic barriers that involved private testing, and Spain obtained testing sets from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of these collections were incorrect.
The company explained that the lack of results could be an unsuccessful sample collection or misuse of collections.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would reject and replace the collections of the other collections of Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80 per cent of the tests that Chechia obtained in China were incorrect. 1.2 million of the tests received by Slovakia in China were also recognized as incorrect.
Prime Minister Matovic proposed that they be removed to Dunya. Atesh Kara, a member of the Ministry of Health of Turkey, claimed that the tests acquired in China had “high level of errors” and the Ministry “did not use them”. The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but at the beginning of April 2020 it was declared inappropriate for use.
Quarantine measures for those whose analyses had a positive impact on SARS-CoV-2, as well as the monitoring of people with whom such patients had been contacted, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, where the first man died from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two cycles of testing of the whole population of approximately 3400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed disease were placed on quarantine.
The entry into the territory of the population has been closed and this measure has completely halted the spread of infection.
In the context of intensive monitoring of contacts, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures of the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic in Singapore, there was much less pressing than in other developed countries, and there was no need to impose extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and shops.
Many activities were cancelled, and Singapore began to urge residents to stay home on 28 March, but schools that ended on 23 March opened up on schedule.
A number of other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also faced pandemics through intensive monitoring of contacts, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, but their restrictions have been less aggressive.
Statistics have shown that in countries where more tests were performed compared with the number of deaths, mortality rates were significantly lower, probably because these countries were able to identify more patients with mild-expressed symptoms or lack of symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative analysis results to COVID-19 in one of 16 WHO laboratories to confirm testing.
7 of these 16 control laboratories are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
The following graph refers to the ‘ positive results’ test policies adopted in a specific country.
The country in which only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive percentage than the country in which all citizens are tested, regardless of the presence of symptoms of the virus, under other conditions.
My hand, also known as a “hygiene arm,” is a process of cleaning hands with a view to removing contamination, iron, microorganisms or other harmful substances.
A regular wash-out arm at certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted on a falsified basis.
A person may also be affected by respiratory diseases, such as flu or usual sneezing, for example, if he is injured by eyes, nose, or mouth (that is, his or her eyes) with unobtrusive hands.
Five critical moments during the day after which hands should be held with the mill: before and after the failure, after the child's age or change of gear, before the child's belly, before the eggs, and after the preparation or processing of raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and honey are not available, the hands can be cleaned using the sun.
Until, in time and after preparing food.
Even after the procedure for treating a sick person.
After changing the trailers or subduing the child who went to the toilet.
After the snoring, cough, or chicania.
After attachment to animals, worms or wastes of animal origin.
The medical hygienic arm is related to hygiene related to medical procedures.
Hands before medication or medical procedures can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to wash hands from pathogens (bacterials, viruses or other microorganisms capable of causing disease) and from chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who are preparing or working in the medical field, but it is also important for all others.
Its hands are very useful for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronary disease and other infectious diseases, prevents infection of diarrhoea, and reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
and reduces infant mortality in households.
The 2013 study showed that a higher quality of arm can lead to a relatively slow growth of children up to five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoea diseases can be reduced by adopting simple habits such as soft hands with hair.
This elemental procedure is able to reduce mortality from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular reminders about the benefits of hand washing can reduce the number of cases of diarrhoea by approximately three, and this will be compared to the benefit of low-income regions.
The reduction in the number of cases of diarrhoea by 48 per cent can be associated with breast cancer. It is the only effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhoea and severe respiratory diseases (ORDs) in order to develop appropriate habits in each home, in schools and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major problems of the IRI, is the main cause of mortality among children up to five years of age, which affects the lives of about 1.8 million children a year.
As a result of diarrhea and pneumonia, nearly 3.5 million children are killed annually.
The United Nations Children's Fund reports that breast-feeding and breast-feeding can save more lives than any individual vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce the mortality from diarrhoea almost twice, and death from severe respiratory infections is fourth.
It is usually accompanied by other health activities carried out under water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
My hand also prevents the occurrence of an impeccable disease that is transmitted directly to the physical contact.
The small negative effect of a common finger is that it can lead to skin excretion and, therefore, damage to it.
The 2012 data study showed that too often the hand can lead to drying and drying of the skin, a disease known as an exacerbation or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health workers.
Too often the arm can also be regarded as one of the symptoms of obsessive and Compulsive Disorder (OCR).
There are five so-called “critical moments” during the day when hand washing with milk is important to reduce the risk of falsified transmission of the disease: post-carriage (duty, defect), post-mortem ageing of the child (mortem change), before the child’s feeding, before food and before/after preparing or processing of raw meat, fish or birds.
Some other cases where it is necessary to wash your hands in order to prevent the transmission of disease: before or after the treatment of a wound or wound, after schizophrenia, cough or sneezing, after touching the waste of the animal or the animal, after touching the mouse.
In many countries, hand washing is quite widespread.
A study on hand washing, conducted in 2015 in 54 countries, showed that the average of 38.7% of households with breast cancer is generally accepted. The 2014 study showed that the highest rate, 97%, was established in Saudi Arabia; the United States is closer to the average, their rate is 77%; the lowest rate was established in China – 23%. There are currently several methods of changing behavior and developing the practice of hand washing in breast-feeding. In developing countries, the group arming of students has been established for a period of time.
“An emergency health assistance programme”, carried out by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines, is an example of extensive activities to promote child health and children's education.
The national programme is based on degelminization, which takes place twice a year, as well as daily wash hands with a mill and daily cleaning of teeth with a fan.
The same programme has been successfully carried out in Indonesia.
The removal of micro-organisms from each cover is more effective if the mill is added to the mill or power plant.
The main action of lead and mine is to remove barriers to soluble and improve its level.
Water itself is not considered an effective means of cleaning the skin, as fat and protein components of organic contamination are badly dissolved in water.
A sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the cleaning process.
A solid honey may also contain bacteria that may fall on it during previous use.
A small number of studies involving the fall on each surface of the bacteria from the contaminated hard clay shell point to a small probability of such a fall, as bacteria are laughing at the penis.
The CCC still claims that “a hand-held mill is a preferred option for hand washing”.
Antibacterial furniture is actively announced in communities that are concerned about their health.
Today, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, the antibacterial mill contains scattered antibacterial agents, such as triclosane for which many resistant strains of organisms are sustained.
Thus, even if strains that are resistant to antibiotics are not selective in relation to antibacterial mellitus, their effectiveness may not be consistent with the announced.
In addition to the surface-active substance and the means to protect skin, complex compounds may contain acids (excessive, ascorbinic, milk) as regulators, as well as antimicrobial active gasoline acids and other wastes (aloe faith, vitamins, mantalol, plant extracts). A complex analysis conducted by the University of Oregon University of Public Health has shown that in order to prevent skin diseases and bacteria from being removed from the skin, simple diversity was as effective as normal antibacterial honey containing triclosane.
The hot water is comfortable for human skin temperature is still not enough hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria are rapidly spreading at 37°C.
However, in order to remove natural pollutants and bacteria, hot cool water is more effective than cold.
In spite of the widespread view, research has shown that the use of hot water does not affect the reduction of the mic load on the hands.
A hand healer or an antiseptic for a hand is a hygienic arm that does not contain water.
At the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century, the population of healthy hands was collected on a non-water basis (also known as self-definition tools, antiseptics for hand disinfection or sanitizers).
Most of these products are produced by an isopropyl spirit or ethanol with the addition of amplifiers such as carbomers (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of a gel, or in the form of glycerin in a liquid or penic form which facilitates the use of these substances and reduces the effect of skin excretion.
Adding the diluted water distribution increases the antimicrobial activity, and disincentives containing at least 60 to 95 per cent of the spirit are effectively destroying the microbes.
Injectives kill bacteria, including bacteria with multiple drug sustainability (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, as well as some viruses (including HIV, Herpes, RSV, rivirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and influenza.
The disinfectants containing 70 per cent of breath kill 99.97 per cent of bacteria (a decrease of 3.5 equivalent to 35 decibels) in hands over 30 seconds after application and 99.99 per cent of bacteria (a decrease of 4 to 5) in hands over 1 minute after application. The disincentives are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Injectives are practically ineffective against the virus virus (or Norwalk) of the type, most often due to the infection of the host. A sufficient number of antiseptics or spraying agents should be used to treat and wash the skin thoroughly with both sides.
The surface of both layers, as well as the length of the fingers, extends for about 30 seconds until the fluid, pen or gel is fully absorbed.
The end of the arms on both hands should also be closely broken, and the U.S. Center for Control and Prevention of Diseases recommends that you choose for the benefit of your arms rather than for the use of disinfectants, especially if your hands are severely damaged.
The increase in the popularity of such disincentives is due to their simple use and rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but they must not be replaced by a fully-assessed arm if there is a possibility of using water and lead.
Often the use of hand-drawn equipment may cause dry skin if it does not contain sweetening agents and/or skin-matching agents.
The effect of drying skin may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other sweetening substances to the composition of the device.
In clinical trials, hand disinflammation, which contained sweetening components, resulted in a significantly lower discoloration and dryness of the skin than honey or anti-immunic acid.
Allergic contact dermatitis, connective tissue syndrome or hypersensitiveness to breath or additives present in disinfective agents are not present in practice.
The lower probability of causing disincentive contact dermatitis has become a factor in the selection of disinfectives compared to honey and water.
Despite its effectiveness, non-water resources do not wash hands from organic matter but simply dissipate them.
For that reason, hand disincentives are not so effective as to prevent the spread of many pathogenic microorganisms, such as common salts and water, as pathogenic microorganisms are still on their hands.
The effectiveness of the uncontained hand is largely dependent on components and components, and has historically been much lower than that of the wind or spray.
It has recently been shown that the preparations in which Benzalconic chloride is used have a steady and cumulative anti-immune activity other than alcohol, which, as has been shown, is losing effectiveness after multiple use, probably due to progressive side reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford to be soft and replace it with green or yellow.
Yellow or yellow may be more effective than water, but they will always be less effective than honey.
One problem with this approach is that if the soil or soil are contaminated by micro-organisms, it may, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
As with honey, the gold is a disinclined instrument, as it is formed in contact with water.
If it is not available, WHO recommends using gold or sand as alternatives.
To prevent infection, the Center for Disease Control in the United States recommends the use of hand washing techniques, including the following steps:
Wash your hands under hot or cold water.
Water is recommended because standing water may be contaminated, and there is no need for water.
Help your hands with a large amount of lead, including the back of the legs, as well as between your fingers and your legs.
Microbes removed from the skin, and studies have shown that people tend to wash their hands more closely when using milk (not just one water).
Three hands at least 20 seconds.
The tendon helps remove the skin from the skin, and as long as you keep your third hands, the more the microbes are removed.
Get your hands really dirty under the water.
Hand washing in steady water can cause re-injury.
Wash your hands with clean soap, or let them lift themselves up.
The soft and soft hands are easily contaminated, and most often people leave such areas as large thumbs, sands, between fingers and under legs.
The artificial legs and the damaged leg can contain many micro-organisms.
It is often recommended to use a swab to prevent skin rash, which may cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If water is not available and honey is not available, there are many different ways to wash hands: the selection of water from the upper constituencies or bottle-cubic tube with made openings and/or the use of gold if necessary, such as in developing countries, where limited water supplies (e.g. in schools or rural areas in developing countries) are available, such as foot-and-mouth products and other options.
A knife with a knife is a simple structure consisting of a coating attached to a rope and a knife that is to be attached to the hands of water; it is to be used as a hammer.
The effective dry hand is an integral part of the hygienic process, but there are some disputes about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing number of studies show that the storage capacity is much more hygienic than the electric shocks for hands that have been placed in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster in London, with the sponsorship of the European Symposium for the Production of Stock Laundry and Cottons; this study compared the level of hygiene of stockpillars, hand dryers with hot air and more modern airflow dryers.
It was found that the total number of bacteria on the fingernails is increased by 194 per cent and 254 per cent on the thighs after drying and drying hands in hot air.
It has also been found that the total number of bacteria on the fingernails is 42 per cent and 15 per cent on the thighs after drying and drying hands in the air.
After butter and drying, the total number of bacteria on the fingernails is reduced to 76 per cent, and on the sheets up to 77 per cent. Scientists have also conducted tests to determine the possibility of cross-examination of several toilet rooms and toilet facilities in each type of shower.
The air-drive, which emits air at an estimated speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 km/h), is capable of generating micro-organisms from its own block and potentially harming other users of the toilet room and sansula at a radius of up to 2 metres.
The use of dry air-hands spreads micro-organisms in the radius up to 0.25 metres from dry air.
In 2005, TÜV Product und Umwelt conducted a study on the assessment of different dry hands.
The following changes are observed in the number of bacteria depending on the dry hand method:
There are many different manufacturers of hand mills, and hand mills are similar to those of stockers.
Washing hands using disinfectants can be an alternative solution during travel when there is no flour and water.
The hand-drawn instrument shall contain at least 60 per cent of the spray.
The medical method of hand washing became mandatory after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Zemmelweis discovered his high effectiveness (1846) in preventing disease in situ conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget about it.
According to one study, the use of such devices actually helps to reduce injury.
At least 15 seconds of medical intervention, large amounts of flour, water or gel are used to wash and wash each part of the arm.
The hands should be firmly attached to each other by bending their fingers.
If there's a hole under the legs, it can be used for removal.
Since microbes can stay in the water that is present in their hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them out by washing them clean.
After drying hands, closing the crane, and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors, the storage capacity should be used.
This enables us to avoid further contamination of hands from these surfaces.
The aim of hand washing in medical institutions is to remove and prevent the spread of pathogenic microorganisms (microbes).
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing remains unacceptable in most medical institutions: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before administering them to patients and thus spread microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other essential procedures could reduce the level of blood clots related to catalytic use by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization published a paper on the standard washing and handling of hands that should be used in the health sector.
The WHO manual on hygiene is also available on its website and will open for public discussion.
The related review was conducted in Whitby.
Where confirmation of compliance with the regulatory requirements is required, the manual may be used for measuring the indicators and checking the hygienic devices.
The World Health Organization designates “five moments” when it is necessary to wash your hands:
after contact with blood or biological fluids,
before use of antipsychotics, as well as
After treatment procedures, adding antiseptic chemicals to the bone by hand (“medical” or “antimicrobial”) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary before performing surgical operations or in the environment with high levels of organisms resistant to antibiotics. For “cleaning” hands are required before surgery, which can be included and excluded without touching their hands; and a little chlorogexedin or iodine water should be used to wash hands, sterile gloves for dry hands after a meal, sterile shower for training and other sterile cleaning tools.
All stolen items must be removed.
This procedure is usually required to wash your hands and towels within 2 to 6 minutes.
There's no need to hold hands too long, for example, 10 minutes.
In the dry season, water with moisture should not fall back on the liquids.
After the butter is finished, the hands dry the sterile tissue and hope for a surgical Halat.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic before and after treatment with a sick person.
To combat staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the biggest benefit from breast cancer was the first 20 per cent of breast cancer, and that very little additional benefits were obtained when the frequency of breast cancer was increased by more than 35 per cent.
Compared to an antibacterial powder, the oral oral powder results in more than threefold increase in the frequency of bacterial infections transmitted through food. The proportion of the oral oral oral solution and the oral antibacterial powder, on average, in 30 seconds per procedure, showed that the treatment of the oral solution reduced the bacterial contamination by 26 per cent compared to the antibacterial powder.
However, honey and water are still more effective than hand ventriloquists, in order to reduce the number of influenza A H1N1 viruses and to fight Clostridium difficile. Hand development activities in medical institutions may include training of handshake personnel, increased access to hand-holding solutions, as well as written and oral reminders of the need to wash hands.
Additional studies on the most effective types of measures are needed at various medical institutions.
In developing countries, breast-feeding has been recognized as an economically efficient and important means of improving health and even nutrition.
However, the lack of stable water supply, furniture or tools to wash hands at home, in schools and at work makes it difficult to wash hands regularly.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, not far from each private or public toilet there are places for hand washing, although there are also ways to organize hand washing in such areas.
However, a lack of hygiene may also be caused by tired habits, not by lack of flour or water.
The propaganda and the promotion of arms with lead can affect political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of arms and bring about long-term changes in the conduct of the population.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of such measures, monitoring and evaluation of results should be carried out.
A 70-year study found that, in order to improve the health situation in countries with low income income, effective health care is effective as public marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of propaganda about breastfeeding in schools is the United Nations Children's Fund ' s “Three Star Approach” approach: it advocates implementation in schools of simple economic measures that encourage breast-feeding by students, as well as the implementation of other health requirements.
By ensuring compliance with minimum standards, schools can increase their levels from one to three stars.
The installation of gloves is one of the possible measures implemented in the framework of the health information campaigns to reduce the level of disease and child mortality.
The World Hand Washing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 World Children's Fund, the United Nations Children's Fund promotes the use of handwashing emotives.
Some studies have considered the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared to the DALYs (life-saving years without disability).
However, one study suggests that the promotion of hand washing is much more economical than other health measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health — especially for vulnerable categories such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was first recognized by two medical practitioners in the mid-19th century: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Sammelweis (Ignaz Semmelweis), who worked in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale, English nurse and “the founder of modern care for the sick”.
At the same time, most people still believed that the infection was caused by poisonous gases called miasma.
In the 1980s, due to outbreaks of foodborne diseases and health-related infections, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention became more active in promoting healthy hands as an important measure to prevent infection.
As a result of the outbreak of the swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become better aware of how important it is to wash hands with a needle to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany a number of gloves in public toilets, as well as in office buildings and airport toilets, were provided with “right hand washing machines”.
The phrase “smoothing hands” means a refusal to take responsibility for anything or to be a participant.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate “swallowed his hands ” when he decided to crush Jesus Christ; then this phrase became more widely used in some English communities.
In the Song of Macbeth, Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth is not allowed to wash his hands in an attempt to clean up the perceived Friday, a symbol of an unclean conscience, because of the crimes she committed herself and encouraged her husband to do.
It has also been established that people who remember or observe any non-ethnic conduct tend to be more prone to take hands than others, and are more important to them.
It is also less likely that people who have the opportunity to wash their hands after seeing them will participate in any other “cleaning” compensating activities, such as voluntary activities.
In the false religion the hand has a hygienic purpose, as well as a symbolic significance. The symbolic washing of hands with water, but without milk, is part of the ritual prescribed in many religions, including bahism, India, tevilah and netillat Yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religion also prescribes hygienic washing hands, especially after certain actions.
India, Judaism, and Islam are required to wash their hands after visiting the toilet.
In India, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after each meal.
Control of production factors in relation to COVID-19
The control of production factors related to COVID-19 implies the use of methods for working safety and health in order to control risks and combat the 2019 crown virus (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk control at the workplace depends on the location and task, based on the assessment of risks, the seriousness of the epidemic in the community and the risk factors for individual workers that may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The United States Office for Labour and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) reported that low-risk posts had minimum professional contacts with the public and colleagues, and, in such cases, basic measures were required to combat infection, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home with signs of illness, compliance with the respiratory label, and day-to-day treatment and job disinfection.
Inter-risk duties require partial or close contacts with persons who do not have COVID-19 confirmed or suspected diagnosis, but are likely to be affected by the current spread of disease in society or during international travel.
This category can be addressed by public workers, such as schools, high-level working environments and some large retail shops.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to the basic measures to prevent infection, include the use of high-efficiency air filters, the use of protective screens and the availability of personnel protection in the case of a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA believes that medical personnel who contact a person with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 are at high risk; thus, the risk increases to a high level in conducting such aerosol-based procedures or collecting/processing samples from a person with approved diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk control measures for such personnel include the use of technical and engineering equipment, such as ventilating rooms with negative pressure, as well as protective personnel suitable for the purpose.
COVID-19 can be used for various types of impact on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because of their own illness, the need to care for other persons or due to the fear of possible injury.
Commercial patterns can be changed in respect of the types of goods on which there is demand and how to acquire such goods (e.g. purchases in non-compliant periods of delivery or service without leaving the machine).
Finally, it is possible to prevent the delivery of goods from the geographical regions affected by the COVID-19. In the organization of protection, a plan for the preparation of the epidemic and for the implementation of the response can be used.
The plans address risks related to different workplaces and tasks, including pollution sources, risk factors arising from home and in communities, as well as risk factors for individual workers, such as live age or chronic diseases.
The plans also provide the means of monitoring necessary to address such risks as well as plans for emergency situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Plans to prepare for and respond to the epidemic may be guided by recommendations at the national or state level.
Some of the objectives of responding to the epidemic are to reduce the spread of HIV among personnel, to protect people at a higher risk of serious health problems, to maintain business operations and to minimize the negative impact of other organizations on their delivery chains.
Responses affect the severity of the disease in the community where business is located.
Risk control funds are a structure that is widely used to ensure safety and health at work, for the collection of such funds according to efficiency.
When the risk of COVID-19 disease cannot be resolved, the most effective engineering and technical means of security are then administrative measures and, finally, the means of personal protection.
The technical security means imply the isolation of workers from workplace-related risks and are not dependent on the behaviour of the worker, which may be the most economically beneficial solution.
Administrative measures require changes in the working policies or procedures required by the employee or staff member.
Staff protection (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but may help to address some risks.
All types of personal protection should be selected depending on the threat to the worker, to be applied to the size (e.g. respirators), to use regularly and properly, to check regularly, to maintain and to replace as necessary, as well as to remove, clean and maintain or to protect from injury.
The Office of the United States Department for Labour and Industrial Health (OSHA) considers that the minimum risk posts are in contact with the public and its colleagues.
The basic measures for combating epidemics recommended for all workplaces include frequent and tight hand-to-hand, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, compliance with the respiratory label, including closure of the hand in case of cough and shingle, the provision of refrigerators and containers for butter, willingness to remove or change work, where necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, as well as daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of persons who may be potentially affected is a critical step towards the protection of workers, clients, visitors and others at work.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that staff with severe respiratory diseases stay home until the end of the year, the absence of increased body temperature and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of anti-pharmaceuticals or other anti-psychotic medications, and also prescribes the flexibility of health care policies, allowing staff to stay home for care for a sick family member and to inform staff of such policies.
According to OSHA, high-risk positions require partial and close contacts at a distance of not more than six feet (1.8 m) with persons with no COVID-19 confirmed data or suspects of infection, but there is a likelihood that SARS-COV-2 will be infected with disease in a community in the territory where business is located, or with recent visits of such a person at the COVID-19 site.
These categories include workers who have been in contact with the public, for example in schools, working in the environment with high population levels and some large variety of shops. In engineering and technical safeguards for such groups and groups with higher risks include the establishment of high-efficiency air filters, the increase of ventilation, the establishment of physical barriers such as transparent plastics, and the installation of anyone for service without leaving the car. Administrative measures for such groups and groups of major types of security include sanctions for higher-risk groups, sanctions for setting high-risk air filters, increases the intensity of ventilation, installation of plastics, etc.
In rare cases, workers from such a group may need to wear respirators.
If a person is ill in the aircraft, such measures as isolation of a sick person from other people at 6 feet, appointment of a crew member for the care of a sick person, delivery of a sick mask or treatment to such a person with a request to cover his or her nose and mouth with a knife or a knife.
Secondary crew members shall carry one-off medical stamps when approaching a sick passenger or when compared with physical fluids or potentially infected surfaces and may be additional personal protective means if they have a sick fever, regular cough or difficulty breathing.
The belts and other single items should be placed in a biologically safe place, and the infected surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected. In the case of commercial navigation, including cross-liners and other passenger ships, safety measures are involved in the removal of travel in the event of illness, self-insolation and immediately informing the medical centre of the ship when there is a noise or other symptoms in any ship.
Ideally, medical examination should be carried out in an isolated cage of such a person. In the case of schools and childcare facilities, CDC recommends short-term closures for treatment or disinfection if the infected person is in school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
In the presence of a minimum or average level of infection in the community, social exclusion strategies such as removal of income for personal meetings, assemblies and other mass activities such as physical or mental drinking, eating in the cafeterias, increasing distance between parties, controlling time of arrival and care, restricting unnecessary visits, using a separate location of health facilities for children with flu symptoms.
In addition to social exclusion strategies, measures can be considered for long-term visits to schools, and for law enforcement officials carrying out their daily duties, direct health risks are considered to be low in the opinion of CDC.
Law enforcement officers who are obliged to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 are advised to follow the same instructions as are prescribed for emergency relief workers, including the use of appropriate personnel protection.
In the event of close contact during the detention of workers, the staff shall clear and disinfect their formal tyres and casings prior to re-use using domestic clean aerosols or by protesting, comply with standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of disease and toss the use of personal protective equipment, as well as the use and use of clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of health and maritime workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk posts include medical assistance, support, laboratory and medical transport personnel, who contact patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19.
They have a very high risk of injury when conducting aerosol education procedures or when collecting/processing samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
Aerosol-based procedures include evaporation, cassation, bronchoscopy, some stomatological procedures and surveys or sampling of invasive methods.
Seafarers with high-risk personnel are treated with COVID-19 confirmed disease or suspected of infection at the time of their death; if such personnel are exposed, they are at a very high risk. Additional engineering and safety facilities for such groups include the use of isolated facilities for patients with confirmed COVID-19, including in the conduct of aerosol education procedures.
In some health and maritime institutions, an effective measure may be applied to special ventilation with negative pressure.
Efforts should be made to comply with the precautionary measures envisaged for the level of biological safety 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the distribution of advanced patients in the restricted waiting zones depending on the presence of suspects of COVID-19. In addition to other personnel protection measures, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for up to 6 feet of patients with confirmed disease or suspicion of SARS-CoV-2, as well as those conducting aerosol education procedures.
In the United States, approved NIOSH respirators for a N95 filter or higher class must be used in the context of an integrated written programme for respirator protection, which sets out requirements for individual collection of funds and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort for the staff. WHO does not recommend using special care because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not through physiological fluids.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for staff performing screening at the patient reception point.
WHO recommends that individuals who collect samples from respiratory pathways in patients with COVID-19 or carriers of this disease without aerosol education procedures should wear a surgical mask, glasses or a protective screen for the person, the halo and the perforator.
In the course of procedures for aerosol education, the N95 or FFP2 shall be replaced by a surgical mask.
In view of the insufficient availability of individual protection funds worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the need for such protection through the use of remote medical facilities, physical barriers, such transparent surfaces, access to the patient infected with COVID-19, only those who provide direct care, use only those personal protection funds that are necessary for the specific task, the continued use of one and the same respirator, without being able to deal with a few patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of staff protection arrangements, and not using names and recommendations.

THEMA: [Covid-19] Facilitation of load and preparation for the future
DATE/YYYY REVISION: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
DESCRIPTION: CC0: No protected rights
In this month, we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that shines light on the relationship between people all over the world and our responsibility to each other.
We had no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our actions depends on the ability to feel, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is based on such an organization.
We have observed friendly and caring relations between all our colleagues, as reflected in the electronic record, telephone calls and chats — a remarkable testimony to the fact that, fortunately, we are working with them.
I am very grateful and proud to speak of you as colleagues.
Last week, I was informed of the high estimate of our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to approach Wikipedia right now and how useful it is for everyone to have access to this key resource online.
And this may be due to your work, whether it is to ensure the ability of websites, to pay our colleagues or to protect the security of the community.
I need information from Wikipedia, and this is more important today than ever before.
In order to achieve significant results for the world, it is important not only what we do but how we do it.
With regard to the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make significant changes in our joint work, starting from next week.
Correction of our work schedules and schedules
As noted earlier by Robin, the c-team team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In the course of the community, we have considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during that period.
Most of us wanted to cut off tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to quit, let's do it.
For staff, contractors and staff:
According to our expectations, we will need to work about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week before the next order comes.
We do not announce the dates of departure: if you can work properly for more hours, this will be allowed for our mission.
However, we do not expect peace now; no matter what your needs are, be concerned about your relatives, buying food or going to a doctor’s office, your welfare is our number one priority.
We're not following your working time.
If you're sick, you shouldn't work.
That's understandable and unambiguous, but we're talking about it.
There is no need for a medical letter or reply: simply inform your manager and help the team review the calendar and work schedule to ensure that key areas are covered.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, contact Brian from the T&C Ops Unit so that T&C can provide support and appropriate attention from the guidance to your situation).
The fees will be paid in full.
We have already declared and confirmed our intention to comply with our obligations to our contractors and staff with a respectable rate of payment.
Each person shall be paid in accordance with the usual rates of attendance applied under normal circumstances.
This means, in particular, periods of illness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use their work as a means of bringing their efforts into the world around us.
What we do can bring surprising results, especially at such times.
And again, it's about self-help.
We invite you to talk to our guide so that we can know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered essential.
We must always support such activities.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety and Fundraising (except for others) teams are doing critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating the process for all units to assess the current objectives and focus on providing support, which is very important for our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we are just focusing on the most important projects.
The delay today does not have a negative impact on the future.
We are not planning to work "two more to raise the missing" after the end of the pandemic.
You will not need to work too long to meet the unrealistic deadlines for the current period.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and we will work on setting new goals and deadlines as soon as possible.
What is happening to the APP (annual plans)?
In order to adjust to the new reality and expectations of the daily working time, we intend to adjust the time limits for the implementation of our Annual Plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of the time frame for our 2019-2020 plan, thus providing more time for budgeting, which will allow staff to give critical priority to work, self-help and care for the near and all who need or want to work, a reduced schedule will be provided for the next few weeks.
Such an extension of time would significantly reduce the current load on planning and pressure throughout the organization.
The next week, we will submit our proposal to the Council, the representatives and the teams, as soon as possible after the relevant confirmation.
I thank the APP team for its leadership role in this work.
Status of office, risk and discharge
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues from San Francisco could be infected with COVID-19.
However, in addition to many precautionary measures, we have made a counter-rescue team to dissipate all surfaces in the office in San Francisco.
They have used countermeasures of the medical class to dissipate all surfaces, as well as for acceptable and elevators, through which access to our roofs can be obtained.
The buildings shall apply their own rules of caution with the use of products that ensure the safety of their buyers.
We feel that the office will be well prepared until we decide to return.
Our branch in Colombia (DC) is located on the WeWork network, which has been shared with us and with all the staff in the DC with their COVID-19 rules.
Last week, our office in the area of Colombia had completely moved to remote work in accordance with the instructions received in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues from New York know, we have also discussed the rent in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are at first working away.
Our old colleagues working away know about the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended to limit the duration of the meetings to one or two hours.
In the case of longer sessions, consider the possibility of breaking them up in a course of several days.
The purpose of the meeting, the agenda and previously the various information materials are clearly defined.
In quiet mode, use videos to facilitate interaction and communication, such as Google Docs and Zoom.
To facilitate the appointment of a coordinator, a person who will monitor the arrival of issues in tea and control the list of speakers, as well as the one responsible for conducting notes (or joint views).
If necessary, please contact the Service of Technical Support by e-mail.
Enjoy your benefits under the Wellness Reimbursement programme when you buy breakfast.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to colleagues about the assigned work.
The HR Operations team is studying the urgonomic guidelines available in the form of web sites to facilitate the effectiveness of the distributed work across the organization.
Last week, we asked all the beneficiaries of the community to cancel the mass activities funded by Wikimedia, such as "editathons", until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may result in the inability to carry out agreed activities on borders, and no one will be excluded from the delays or change of such objectives.
In the coming week, we will conduct follow-up activities with additional instructions on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general attitude of the global community is not only a setback for the cessation of work but also a sense of mutual understanding and the possibility of focusing on their own communities, not only on Wikimedia.
With regard to the prospect, the CRT is working on the Meta-Wiki site, which provides space for communities that can monitor the impact and public.
We remain in touch with issues related to COVID-19
We will send you an invitation to a special meeting of staff on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time, we are taking advantage of the opportunity to share further relevant information, to answer your questions, and to spend time with each other.
We are together in this situation and ready to help as much as we can.
You can still get information from this e-book, while other important information about COVID-19 is available from Office Wiki.
The CRT will update such pages, and all information will be collected in one place.
We also work on maintaining regular communications with staff living in countries where the current situation has had a significant impact.
When there are travel, activities, a key labour stream, information lighting problems or, if necessary, contact the CRT.
We are ready to support and communicate as necessary.
If there are confidential issues, please contact Brian Juden, Director of HR International Global Operations, by e-mail.
No such changes should be considered as a rejection of our work and our obligations.
A quick turn: this is a recognition of the potential existing need for a cardinal new adaptation of our work and obligations.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support one another and to ensure that we continue to work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the world through the services needed.
Our work will wait until the time is right.
It is now time to support one another and create space for important work that will take place in the coming week and perhaps months.
For this to happen, we will need help from each of you; and we need you to be able to care for yourself and your families, as well as to work with maximum income as soon as that need arises.
Now, please, help your hands and don't hurt your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the other members of the Leadership Team (Grand I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-transverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a plant attached to the outer surface (cellular membranes) cells in the light, arteries, heart, joints and the kitchen.
ACE2 inhibits the activity of the relevant angiotensin-converting plant (ACE), reduces angiotensin-II and increases Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution to treat heart disease. AC2 also serves as a point of entry into cells for some crown viruses.
The human version of the farm is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-transverting plant 2 is a zinc-containing metal farm located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 label contains the N-final peptidase domain M2 and the C-final transport domain of the renal amino acid collection.
ACE2 is a single-pronged type I membrane, its farmable active domain falls on the surface of light cells and other tissues.
The ACE2 single-celled domain is separated from the transmissible domain by another farm known as the shady, and the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually released from the power.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most light type II alveolar cells, enterocytes of thin tissue, arterial and venous endocell cells and cells of the smooth muscles of most organs.
Biosynthesis ACE2 and RNCs are also found in the core of the brain, striatum, hypothalamus and brain cells.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE opponent.
ACE is absorbed by angiotensin I hormone in angiotensin II co-existing agent.
ACE2, in turn, absorbs and hydrolyses the carboxylic endocylic amino acid phenylaline from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it in vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also pass a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradidine, apelin, neurotensin, diniorphine A and ethylene.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the transporter of SLC6A19 neutral amino acids and is present in Hartnup disease.
As a transmbed white, ACE2 serves as the primary entry point for some coronary viruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (saras-saras virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus).
In short, the link of white S1 to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the ACE2 farmed area on the surface of the cell leads to endocytosis and transfer of both the virus and the enzymes within the cells.
This process of entry also requires the improvement of white S by the serial protease of the TMPRSS2 carrier, which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic tool, which has led some to believe that lowering ACE2 levels in cells can help fight infection.
Nevertheless, many professional communities and regulators recommend continuing standard treatment for AFP and BRA inhibitors.
According to a systematic review and analysis published on 11 July 2012, “the use of AFP inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34 per cent compared to the control group”.
Moreover, “pneumonism risk has also been reduced in patients receiving ADP inhibitors who have been at higher risk, pneumonia disease, especially in patients with insulin and heart failure.
The use of AFP inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia mortality, although the results were less reliable than in patients with overall risk of pneumonia.”
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be a novelty in the treatment of mild injury, and it is apparent that it improves the leukaemia and oxygen levels in growth with severe respiratory failure syndrome caused by lipopolischarides.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours, and the start of action is 30 minutes, except for the duration of effects within 24 hours.
Some data suggest that rhACE2 can be a promising means for people with the inviolability of classical renin-angiogenase inhibitors (RAS Inhibitors) or in patients with increased circulation of angiotensin II. The rhACE2 was evaluated in clinical trials in the treatment of acute respiratory dystrophy syndrome.
The COVID-19 Annexes are software applications for mobile phones designed to assist in epidemiological investigation under the 2019-20-year-old coronavirus pandemic, that is to identify persons (contacts) who could contact an infected person.
In some regions, many of the applications officially supported by the authorities have been developed or proposed.
Several options have been developed for monitoring contacts.
This led to a discussion on confidentiality issues, particularly with regard to systems based on the geographical location of the users of the applications.
More softer options in this regard include the use of Bluetooth signals to register the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that their efforts to integrate had been supported by Bluetooth directly in their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Government, together with A gladio, has launched an annex that allows citizens to check whether they have been associated with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities and is used in Singapore under the name TraceTogether.
The annex was developed by local IT companies, with an open source code and will be handed over to the Government. North Macedonia launched the “StopKorona” application on Bluetooth, helping to monitor contacts with potentially infected people and provide operational contact with health authorities.
The annex was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As at 14 April 2020, the application was expected to register in Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking facility was at the final stage of development and would be available for deployment within a few weeks. Similar applications are planned to run in Ireland and France (StopCovid).
Australia and New Zealand are considering the possibility of using the applications based on the TraceTogether and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use the application using the geozoned function to ensure that patients with the COVID-19 diagnosis living in Moscow do not leave their home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security, Cambridge University, identified a number of potential practical problems that could arise with systems based on applications, including false practices and potential ineffectiveness in the use of applications only a small part of the population.
In view of the concern about the proliferation of corrupt or harmful coral viruses, Apple limited the list of types of organizations that might propose its applications related to coral viruses in the App Store, including only “official” or other trust organizations.
Google and Amazon also imposed similar restrictions.
The participants expressed concern about the impact of mass monitoring on the population by means of coral virus-related applications; in particular, the question was whether the monitoring infrastructure created to combat coral virus pandemics would be depleted when the threat disappeared.
The International Amnesty Organization and more than 100 other organizations have published a statement calling for such supervision to be restricted.
The organizations have announced eight terms of reference to public projects:
Monitoring shall be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
The extension of monitoring and monitoring should be accompanied by reservations on the limitation of the duration of action;
The use of data should be limited to the purpose of combating the spread of COVID-19;
The security and anonymity of data should be protected and evidence of such protection should be provided;
Digital monitoring should avoid cases of increased discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties must be determined at the legislative level;
Protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse should be guaranteed;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and the Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Boundzen) (RSF) have also published their lists.
Google and Apple have proposed their joint plan to address the problem of permanent monitoring, which is to remove the monitoring mechanism from their operating systems as soon as necessary.
In some countries, instead of applications, there is a net monitoring of the location, which excludes the need to load the application and avoid traceability.
The follow-up was approved in Israel.
Network decisions, which have access to source data on the location, also have major potential confidentiality issues.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to staff data on the location; a number of systems have been developed with confidentiality that use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a system not used as a basis for tracking contacts was used.
Instead of using a special application, the system collected trace information from various sources, including data on tracking mobile devices and transactions with maps, and then combined them to produce notifications in the form of text messages that were sent to potential infected persons.
The Government not only used this information to warn citizens of potential contacts with infected persons but also provided information on the location of public access, which was possible as a result of substantial changes to the law on the protection of information that was introduced after the arrival of the MERS in that country.
Access to such information can be obtained through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, consider the possibility of using both centralised and confidential systems.
As at 6 April 2020, details were not yet made available.
Follow-up to contacts with confidentiality is an established concept of a significant amount of research literature, at least for 2013. As at 7 April 2020, more than 10 expert groups were working on confidential decisions such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register the user’s approach to other mobile phones.
The PEPP-PT, however, is a product of coordination efforts that include both central and decentralised approaches and are not the only protocol. Decentralised protocols include decentralised transit with confidentiality (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), protocols to ensure confidentiality, mechanisms for tracking mobile contacts (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for never leaving the device but for all comparisons.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is engaged in the development of SafePaths, a platform that ensures confidentiality when collecting and using location data or crossing routes to track the spread of COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on the studies presented in the “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic”, published in March 2020. Another similar project is the Enigma MPC platform, which was originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable equipment technologies that enable users to exchange confidential data on location and health with other users and officials without risking their confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, groups that shared the same approach and used similar protocols were founded by the global coalition of TCNs aimed at reducing fragmentation and ensuring the global compatibility of applications for monitoring and reporting, which was the key factor in their wide dissemination.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the original BlueTrace used in its official annex.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative, which, as they claimed, will ensure confidentiality, and which is the basis of a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography that will enable you to maintain confidentiality.
They also published the technical characteristics of key technologies used in the work of the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:
Dissemination of tools to enable Governments to establish official applications for monitoring the movement of infected colon virus by citizens, but maintaining data confidentiality
By integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple are planning to solve problems with constant monitoring, they have introduced the system through an update of the operating system and then removed it after the threat has been eliminated.
Reposition of the medicinal product (also known as reproducination, transfer, change of tasks or therapeutic transfer) is a reproducible medicinal product for the purpose of treating a disease or a medical condition other than the disease intended for development.
This is one of the research approaches currently being used to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other studies include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and reconvalence plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 proteins that affect medicinal products, each of which has several ligaments.
The analysis of these connecting sites provides an appropriate basis for the development of effective anti-virus preparation against whites COVID-19.
The most important proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNC-dependent RNC-polymerase, helixase, S-white and ADF-ribophosphatase.
Hussain AA and his associates studied several candidates who were then optimised and analysed their structure with the most similar approved preparations to speed up the development of a high-efficiency preparation against SARS-CoV-2, which would be recommended for clinical studies.
Chloroquin is an antimalarial preparation that is also used to treat some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and its associated hydroxychloroquine would be included in the four preparations studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
The Governor of New York Andrew Kuomo announced that chlorine and hydrochlorin tests would begin in New York on 24 March. On 28 March, FDA authorized the use of hydrochlorin sulphate and chloroquine in accordance with the emergency authorisation (USA).
The treatment scheme was not approved during the FDA trial process and was authorised in accordance with USAA only as an experimental treatment for emergency care in patients treated but could not be treated in clinical trials.
The CDC stated that “the procedure for the use, dosing or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection” has not yet been established.
Doctors say they use the preparation when the second exit is not.
The Turkish research group in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chlorine in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Major studies are conducted at the University of Duke and Oxford.
The New York University Medical School in Langone is studying the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
The Chinese clinical trials in Hughan and Shenchen showed that favipivir was “very effective”.
35 patients in Shenzhen, who took this preparation, received a negative result in an average of 4 days, while 45 patients who did not receive the preparation were 11 days long.
In Huhana a study was conducted in which 240 patients were monitored with pneumonia, one half of whom received favipivir and the other half were imifenovor.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency reminded the public that the results of the preparation effectiveness were poor and should not be considered final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that to fill its stocks, it would buy food in Japan and that it would be delivered to a university hospital where it would be used for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.
According to the newspaper South China Morning Post, Sindzo Abbe informed the Administration of the tramp about the possibility of buying a product.
Its use may be dangerous for pregnant patients or for patients who are trying to pregnant.
According to one study on the combination of antiviral medicinal products, lopinavir and ritonavir (Caletra), it was concluded that ‘the effectiveness of the use of medicinal products has not been identified’.
Preparations have been developed to prevent HIV response by connecting to the protease.
A group of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify medicinal products to find a link that will be linked to SARS-CoV-2. The scientific community is critical of the reproducibility of medicinal products specially developed for HIV and AIDS therapy.
WHO included the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the international "Solidarity" test.
Remdesivir was created and developed Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola and Marburg virus infections. Subsequently, Gilead Sciences staff found that rdedisivir has anti-virus activity in vitro with regard to the multitude of philosophiles, pneumos, paramyxo and coronaviruses.
One of the problems associated with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and transmissions.
Some early preliminary studies have shown that reddesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are currently several clinical trials, including two at the University of Cleveland, one in patients with moderate disease and the other in patients with a more severe form.
Three clinical trials are currently being conducted for the internal administration of vitamin C for people who have been treated with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without placebo (Italy).
On 24 March 2020, antibiotics were tested in New York City.
The Japanese National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a clinical study of Alvesco (cyclosonide) Tejgina, an ingalic cortisosteroid for asthma treatment, to treat pre-sympathetic patients infected with the new coronary virus.
Phase II trial, the form of angiotensin-transforming farm 2, is conducted with 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria treated with severe forms of disease in order to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicin in reducing inflammation and renal impairment in patients with mild-expressed COVID-19 symptoms.
The study called COLCORONA was invited by 6,000 adults 40 years of age and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 with mild non-smoker symptoms.
Women who are pregnant, breast-feeding and who do not use effective contraceptives cannot participate in this study.
A number of coagulants are being tested in Italy.
The low molecular heparin is widely used to treat patients, which has encouraged the Italian Medical Authority to publish recommendations on the use of this medicinal product.
On 14 April, a multi-centre study with 300 patients was announced in Italy on the study of the use of sodium enoxaparin in prophylactic and therapeutic doses.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, significant scientific attention has been focused on reproducing approved anti-virus preparations that have been developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th Chinese recommendations.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th Chinese Recommendation
Some antibiotics that were recognized as potentially suitable for use as COVID-19 treatment:
Tocilizumab (receptor anti-IL-6): approved in China.
Also trials in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 crown virus (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical trials, numerous attempts to develop such vaccines continue.
By the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it was not expected that the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 could be received earlier than 18 months later.
In April five vaccinators conducted phase I safety studies.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020 the outbreak of this disease spread worldwide, leading to significant investments in the development of vaccines and research activities in its context.
Many organizations are using published genes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key tasks of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are to ensure the necessary speed, production capacity, wide deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, there were 10 different technological platforms for effective vaccination against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in phase I security research:
nucleinic acid (NNC and RNC) ( Stage I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, IRNC-1273)
virus vector ( Stage I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus vector type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are at early stages of development, 78 of which are used in approved active projects (79 according to the Milkena Institute); 37 additional vaccines have been reported, but there are little information available (probably, are at the planning or development stage).
A preliminary safety and immunogenic test is carried out at stages I-II, usually randomized, placebo-controlled and in several places with a more precise and effective dose definition.
Phase III of the trials usually includes more participants, including the control group; at this stage, preparations are tested to be effective in preventing disease and at the same time monitoring side effects at optimal doses.
74 of the 79 vaccine candidates who were in active development (assisted at the beginning of April 2020) had not been tested in person ( still in clinical trials).
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it would study the potential of a molecular vaccine that genetically modifies viral whites to stimulate immune response.
On 24 January 2020, the International Centre for Vaccine (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the start of work on its own vaccine with a view to starting testing for people in 2021.
The launch of vaccine development projects was also announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.

By the end of March, the Government of Canada had announced the allocation of $275 million in Canada to fund 96 health-related research projects against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccines at Canadian companies and universities such as the Medicago and University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
At the same time, the Government of Canada announced that 192 million Canadian dollars were allocated specifically for the development of vaccines against COVID-19 and plans for the establishment of a national vaccine bank, where several new vaccines could be used in the event of a new outbreak of coronavirus.
On 2 April 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported that PittCoVacc, a potential vaccine against COVID-19 on mice, stated that “MNA introduced SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines, calling for strong response to anti-specific antibodies [in mice] that occurred within 2 weeks of immunization”.
On 16 April 2020, the Canadian Pharmacy School of the University of Waterloo announced the development of a potential vaccine on the basis of DNA, which might be released as a nasal stop.
With the help of DNA bacteria, the spread of human bacteria and the formation of harmless virus-like components that can stimulate the immune system to develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the Government, industry and three universities of the United States united IBM's supercomputer resources in conjunction with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google's cloud accounting resources.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, as well as so-called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other advantages besides their disease prevention properties.
Another randomized study conducted in Australia involves 4170 health workers.
The vaccines developed may be dangerous or ineffective.
Early studies on the assessment of the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models such as COVID-19, such as ACE2-transparent mice, other laboratory animals and lower strains indicate the need for measures to prevent biosafety 3 infection in the processing of live viruses, as well as international coordination of standardized safety procedures.
The vaccines against SARS and MERS were protested on animal models.
As of 2020, SARS does not have medicinal products or protective vaccines that would be safe and effective for people.
According to research work published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicinal products for the treatment of atypical pneumonia has been a priority for governments and public health institutions worldwide.
At the time of the spread of MERS, the SARS study, which was conducted at the time, was considered to be the standard for the development of vaccines and anti-MeRS-CoV therapy.
As of March 2020, there was one (based on DNA) vaccine from MERS, which passed stage I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines, all of which were viruses based on the virus vector and were in the process of developing two adhesion (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
In social networks, the theory of the conspiracy was spread, claiming that COVID-19 is not completely new, and that the vaccine already exists.
Social networks quoted the words of some patients who claimed to have patents on the genetic sequences of other coronavirus strains such as SARS and vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19) that is a infection caused by severe severe respiratory syndrome of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include liqueur, cough, and difficulty in breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, pain in the throat, loss of consciousness and pain in life.
The time from the first symptoms to the outbreak usually consists of about five days, but it can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most cases are caused by mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease is due to viral pneumonia and polyurethane deficiency.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases of injury were recorded in 210 countries and regions, more than 153,000 people were killed.
More than 568 000 people were cured; the virus was mainly spread through close contact with each other, often through microscopic caps, which were given in the air by coughing, whiskey or conversation.
Although these capillaries are formed at exits, they usually pose a threat to the ground or surface but are not transmitted through the air at large distances.
People are also affected by contaminated surfaces and then by their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can live on the surface for 72 hours.
It is most infected within the first three days after symptoms occur, although its spread may be possible both before symptoms occur and at later stages. The standard diagnostic method is a polymeric core reaction with reverse transcription in real-time (RT-PCR) on the sample taken as a muscle from the nose.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients with suspects of disease and for those who are suffering from them.
Recommendations for the use of medical masks vary among the population: some agencies recommend not to use them at all, others recommend their use, and others require it.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment from COVID-19 virus.
The local spread of disease has been registered in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected persons may not have symptoms or symptoms of flu, such as cirrhosis, cough, stiffness and swelling.
Extraordinary symptoms include difficulty breathing, constant pain or feeling chest pain, confusion of consciousness, difficulty in awakening, injury or loss; if above-mentioned symptoms are present, medical attention should be immediately sought.
The symptoms of upper respiratory diseases, such as nausea, vomiting, or pain in the throat, can be observed.
Also, in different percentages, there are cold-skinned symptoms such as cough, fever and diarrhoea.
Some cases of diseases recorded in China were marked only by a feeling of nervousness in the chest and a learning heart.
In some cases, diseases may progress, resulting in pneumonia, polyurethane deficiency, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period usually consists of five to six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, symptoms begin to occur within 11.5 days of infection, and according to the data available, symptoms are not available to all infected people.
The role of such non-sympathetic carriers in the transmission of disease is still unknown, but preliminary data indicate that they can contribute to the spread of infection.
The percentage of infected people with non-sympathetic disease is currently unknown, and the Korean disease control and prevention centres (KCDC) have reported that 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations related to the virus were non-sympathetic.
China's National Health Commission began to include non-sympathetic cases in its daily summary from 1 April; of the 166 cases reported on this day, 130 (78 per cent) were rejected at the time of testing.
And the molluscs and the sun may have a higher concentration of the virus.
The sound of the words in the air is more capillary than the sound of normal noise.
A study conducted in Singapore showed that capillary can be extended to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
The virus is not usually airborne, but the National Academy of Science has suggested that the transmission of the component of the virus by bioaerosol is still possible, and the testing of the air processed by air collectors located in the corridors outside the rooms showed the presence of the virus.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiac resuscitation (SLDs), may lead to the spread of respiratory products and therefore to the spread of air viruses.
There are also fears that the virus may spread through the liver, but this risk is considered low, and the virus is the most contagious when people experience symptoms; the spread of the virus may be even before symptoms occur, but this risk is not high.
The European Centre for Prevention and Control of Diseases (ECDC) claims that until it is clear how easily the virus is spread, however, it is known that one disease is usually infected by 2 to 3 others.
In particular, it was found that the virus was able to live on a mapon surface for one day, on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on a manageable table (AISI 304) — up to three days, and on 99 per cent of dry surfaces — up to 4 hours.
However, these indicators vary according to humidity and temperature.
The soft and powerful means, when properly used, have a beneficial effect on the fight against infection: lead destroys the body of the virus by deactivating it and by enabling it to be removed from the surface of the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalconic chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective against this virus, and during a study conducted in Hong Kong, samples were taken in the medium two days after hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first test showed the highest level of the virus in the blood and in the sixth patient the highest level of the virus in the blood was found on the second day of testing.
The heavy respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the new severe severe coronary respiratory syndrome, first discovered in three people with pneumonia from the group with severe respiratory diseases recorded in Hughan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also met with relatives of the natural crown virus.
In the presence of the human body, the virus is destroyed by a domestic mill that covers its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
Light is the body most affected by COVID-19, as the virus penetrates into the host cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most widely distributed in the alveolar cells of type II.
The virus connects to ACE2 and penetrates into the oxygen cell using a natural surface glycoprotein – “sip” (peplomer).
A severe myocardial infarction has been diagnosed in 12 per cent of the infected patients in the Hughan hospital, which is most frequently encountered in the form of severe disease.
The majority of heart-cooperative symptoms are high due to systemic burning response and immunosuppression observed during disease progression, but severe myocardial infarction may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large amounts as they are involved in the work of this body.
The high incidence of thrombosis (31 per cent) and venous thromboembolism (25 per cent) were observed in patients with COVID-19 who could testify to adverse forecasts.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism to an ACE2-expressive epithelial respiratory tract, COVID-19 symptoms of systemic hyperstimulation are observed in patients with a severe flow of COVID-19.
In particular, it was found that the GM-CSF T-cell pathogens correlate with the recruitment of IL-6 fuel monocytes and heavy pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been detected.
WHO has also published a number of testing protocols for this disease.
Polymeric cell reaction in real-time mode (RT-PCR) is the standard test method.
The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples obtained from the bone marrow, but can also be used by the bone marrow or molluscs.
The results are usually ready for a period of several hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be carried out, but they require two samples of blood taken with a interval of two weeks, and their results are not directly relevant.
Chinese scientists have been able to print and publish its genetic consistency so that scientists in laboratories around the world can develop self-tests by using a polymeric cell response (PCR) to identify the presence of this virus.
As of 4 April 2020, the antibodies tests that could identify infection at the present time as well as the potential injury in the past were in progress, but had not yet been widely distributed.
The Chinese experience of testing results showed that their accuracy was 60 to 70 per cent.
On 21 March 2020, the Office for the Control of the Quality of Food Products and Medicinal Products (FDA) approved the first local diagnostic test and authorized its application at the end of this month.
Bilateral multidotal sub-plevourous performance focuss on the type of mattal glass with peripheral, asymmetric and a posterior distribution are some of the symptoms identified at the early stage of disease.
Sub-domainment, the symptoms of the bulimary bridge (including overheating with changing alveoliar filling) and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
There is little data on microscopic disorders and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological study conducted at the opening:
Macroscopia: pleviritis, pericarditis, erythema and leukemia
Four types of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Light form: light pneumonic father, pneumocyte hyperplasia, major epidemiotic pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and multi- daily giant cell education
Severe pneumonic form: DAD with diffusion alvellary excudad.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory dystrophy syndrome (ORDS) and severe hypoxaemia.
Living pneumonics: organization of exodus in the alveoliary fields and legitimate interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: diffusion of the intestines (DVS-Syndrum); lycoyrobrolastic reaction
Prevention measures to reduce the likelihood of injury include homelessness, human location escape, often washed hands with lead and water for at least 20 seconds, compliance with respiratory hygiene rules, and avoid contact with eyes, noses or intestines.
The CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be closed at the waist or in the neck, or in the absence of the napkin, cover the mouth and nose of the inside of the glove area.
It is recommended that a quality hygiene procedure be carried out for hands.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue masks in public places, in particular with a view to restricting the transmission of infection to people with non-sympathetic diseases, and social exclusion strategies are aimed at reducing contact between infected patients and large groups; these measures have closed schools and businesses, limited the movement of citizens and eliminated major public activities.
The recommendations on distancedness also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart from each other.
There is no confirmed efficacy against COVID-19 as the end of the vaccine is expected to be not earlier than 2021, the main anti-dispersion response of COVID-19 is due to a reduction of the epidemic, known as “exit on board”.
The CDC also recommends that hand washing hands with milk and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or during severe hand pollution, as well as before and after freezing, coughing or sneezing.
CDC also recommends the use of a disincentive-containing (at least 60 per cent of spirit) tool for hand processing, but only when flour and water are not available. WHO provides two prescriptions for local production to regions where such disinfecting facilities are not sold.
These components use ethanol or isopropanols with antimicrobial activity.
The flow of water is used to resolve bacterial disputes in the back and is not a suitable means of antiseptic treatment.
Glycerol is added as a container.
Patients have been shown to support therapy that may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and other life-threatening bodies.
CDC recommends that those suspected of infected with a virus wear a normal medical mask.
The extra-corresponding membrane oxygen (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
In order to strengthen immunity, it is recommended to comply with the rules of personal hygiene, the health of life and diet.
Supporting methods of therapy can be shown to patients with mild symptoms at early stages of disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations on care for patients treated with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive therapy and pulmonologists have combined the recommendations of various institutions in the free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment is available for COVID-19.
For the treatment of symptoms as preparations for the first line, some medical personnel recommend that a choice be made for paracetamol (acetamine) as compared to ibuprofen.
In the execution of procedures in which air-capital emissions such as intubation or dry hands may occur, precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, particularly in medical institutions.
The CDC recommends that medical personnel accompanying people with COVID-19 be placed in an AIIR, an additional measure in addition to standard measures of contact and air safety. The CDC published recommendations on the use of individual protection funds (SIZ) during the pandemic.
The recommended means of individual protection: protective halo, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical belts, which are preferable to use respirators rather than medical masks.
The N95 reactors are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of these reactors in accordance with the emergency authorisation (EUA).
They are designed to protect from particles in the air, such as dust, but they are not guaranteed to protect from a specific biological agent when not using the instructions.
If medical masks are not available, CDC recommends using protective personal screens or, at the end of the case, to make masks on its own under domestic conditions.
In most cases COVID-19 is not too heavy to require an artificial ventilation or alternative, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalised patients with respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 is currently being actively studied, while there are some evidence that intubation can be avoided by a nose oxygen channel with intense air flow or double-level positive pressure in respiratory tract.
It is still unknown whether any of these two methods for patients in critical conditions are as effective as IVL.
Some doctors choose for the benefit of invasive mechanical ventilation, if available, as this method significantly limits the air distribution of particles compared to the nose canules with intense air flow. The risk of severe disease for elderly people (those over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age) is high.
In many developed countries, hospitals do not reach the heart of the population, and health systems are too limited to deal with the sharp increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 in the form of severe hospitalization.
According to a study conducted in China, 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in intensive therapy offices, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical support for light ventilation and 1.4 per cent died.
In China, about 30 per cent of people treated with COVID-19 eventually fall into resuscitation.
The task of providing artificial ventilation is difficult because acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS) developed at COVID-19 and oxygenation is becoming increasingly difficult.
IVL, with the support of pressure on the breath and PDACs, is necessary for the delivery of the maximum amount of oxygen in the light and for the minimizing of the ventilation that can result in pneumonia.
High-voltage PDAs may not be available in earlier models.
The study of potential treatment methods began in January 2020, and a number of antiviral preparations are currently under clinical testing.
The most optimistic is the rhedesivir.
The development of new medicinal products may last until 2021, but some of the tested medicinal products have already been approved for other purposes or are in the latest stages of testing.
Antiviral medicinal products may be tested in patients with severe forms of disease.
WHO volunteers are involved in the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary permission to use recombalant plasma as experimental treatment in cases where human life poses serious or immediate risk.
It was not applied to clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of treatment.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application for the fight against infectious diseases.
To enter, users must enter their name and identification number.
The annex may detect “close contact” using observation data and therefore identify potential risk of injury.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the potential risk is identified, the application not only recommends self-insulation, but also sends a notification to local health authorities. The analysis of large data collected from mobile phones, identification technology, mobile phones and artificial intelligence is used to track the infected and those they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel allowed security authorities to track the data on mobile phones of people who were suspected of being infected with the virus.
Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who may be contacted by infected citizens.
In March 2020, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of Deutsche Telekom, the federal government agencies of Germany and Robert Koha Institute provided aggregated data on the location of hundreds of subscribers.
In Russia, identification technology was introduced to identify offenders.
The regional health authority of Italy, Julio Gallera, said that hundreds of network operators reported that “40 per cent of people continue to move abroad at the same time”.
The Government of Germany has conducted 48-hour exit programming marathons involving more than 42,000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Kersty Kalulayid, also called for creative solutions to be sought against the spread of the crown virus.
People may experience stress related to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects or fear of infection.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: “Strengthening social isolation, loneliness, concern about health, stress and economic loss are the ideal conditions for harming people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease can easily develop with minor or missing symptoms that remind other spreads of upper respiratory diseases, such as common spleen.
Patients with mild form of disease usually recover within two weeks, while patients with severe or critical forms may need from three to six weeks.
pregnant women may be at a higher risk of receiving a severe form of COVID-19 on the basis of data on other such viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although there are no such data on COVID-19. Some people can easily express COVID-19 and cause pneumonia as a complication.
COVID-19 may be rapidly advanced in acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or polyurethane failure.
The COVID-19 complications include sepsis, anomaly thrombosis, as well as heart problems, chest pain and pain.
Thrombocytic anomalies, particularly the increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of patients treated with COVID-19, while in this group, 4% of patients were monitored for failure of the test function.
About 20-30 per cent of patients with COVID-19 have increased the payroll (transsomination).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were in hospitalization.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to intensive therapy was seven days.
Studies of early disease have shown that the average time from initial symptoms to the day of death was 14 days with a total range from six to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8 per cent and 1.7 per cent among women.
Histopathological studies of mild to death samples indicate a diffusion of alveoliar damage with cell fibromyxoid exodus in both easily.
The pneumocytes have been observed with viral cytopathic changes.
An external light-type reminder was made by the extreme respiratory stress syndrome (ORDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths recorded by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were caused by a heart attack or heart failure.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had prior health problems, and access to health resources and the socio-economic situation in the region could also affect mortality.
Death assessments vary depending on the situation because of these regional differences, as well as due to methodological difficulties.
Insufficient effective reporting of cases in an easy-to-be manner can lead to a higher mortality rate.
However, the fact that deaths are caused by diseases acquired in the past can mean that the current level of death is underestimated.
In smokers, severe symptoms of COVID-19 have been developed more than 1.4 times more often, and about 2.4 times more patients have been in intensive therapy or died compared to non-smokers.
The administration of one Hong Kong clinic found that some patients who had suffered from this disease were reduced by 20 to 30 per cent and their scans were damaged.
This can also lead to the “Intensive Treatment Post” syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether permanent immunity to patients who had been infected with the virus was being developed.
The Court of Other Corona Viruses considered this to be likely, but also reported cases where the COVID-19 tests on Coronavirus were still positive after the treatment of COVID-19.
In these cases, it is considered that there was a long-term disease, not re-injurious.
The virus is considered to be natural, animal origin and infection.
The actual origin of the virus was unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to its human transmission.
The first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, called the first disease date of 1 December 2019.
According to official data published by WHO, that date is 8 December 2019.
A number of methods are commonly used for the quantitative assessment of mortality.
All figures vary depending on the region and time of spread of disease, and also affect the levels of testing, quality of health systems used in treatment schemes, from the beginning of the outbreak of disease and population parameters such as age, gender and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO contracted emergency aid codes to ICB-10: U07.1 — for deaths from the laboratory confirmed infection SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 — for deaths from clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. The ratio of deaths and punishments is the number of deaths due to the number of diagnosed cases within a certain period of time.
According to statistics from the University of Johns Hopkins, as of 17 April 2020, the global number of deaths and injuries is 6.9 per cent (153 822/2 240,191).
This figure varies according to the region, and some other methods include the definition of the mortality rate as a result of the disease (CFR), which reflects the percentage of patients diagnosed as a result of the disease, and the definition of the mortality rate as a result of the infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of patients infected (both diagnosed and undiagnated cases) who have been affected by the disease.
These statistics are not linked to a specific period of time and reflect the indicators of a certain population level from the time of injury to the end of the disease.
Although not all patients who have been infected are treated with antibodies, it is possible to understand how many people have been infected.
In the outbreak center in Italy, Castilion d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4600, 80 (1.7%) are no longer alive.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease was spread during the celebration among young people, causing relatively lower deaths, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population can have an antidote, a judge on donor blood.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0,004 per cent of the population).
The effects of pandemics and mortality levels are different for men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher in men.
The highest risk group is men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women is reduced from 90 years of age.
In China the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact causes of this distinction are unknown, but can be attributed to genetic and behavioural factors.
Gender immunological differences, the lower prevalence of smoking among men (e.g., hypertonia that occurs in men younger than women) may be a cause of higher mortality among men.
In Europe 57 per cent of the infected were men, and 72 per cent of the deaths from COVID-19 occurred in men.
As of April 2020, the Government of the United States does not conduct gender statistics on COVID-19.
Research has shown that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and HIV, have different gender statistics.
Most health workers, especially medical personnel, are more likely to be affected by women, respectively.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of this disease: COVID-19.
WHO leader, Mr. Tedros Adam Gabrielus, explains: "CO" means "corona", "VI" "virus", "D" "disease", and 19 when first outbreaks were detected: 31 December 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid shipments to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), species of animals or groups of people, as required by international recommendations on the designation of anti-stigmatization. The virus, called COVID-19, is a severe severe coronary respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses the terms “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 virus” in public communications.
And disease, and the virus itself is usually called a coronavirus.
During the initial outbreaks in Hughan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as Coronavirus and Huhanic Coronavirus.
In January 2020, in accordance with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical places in the name of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended the use of the terms “high respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCOV” as temporary names of viruses and diseases.
Official names: "COVID-19" and "SARS-COV-2" were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limitations of the standard supply chains, some digital service manufacturers print medical materials such as the press for the use of the knife and the details of the IVL equipment.
In one of these cases, the Italian clinic was urgently in need of a ventilator, and the supplier was unable to deliver it at the required time, and one of the local productions was re-profiled and was able to print the required 100 valves per night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, the Internet has been rapidly spreading various theories of conspiracy, misinformation and false information about the origin of the virus, its size, prevention, treatment and other aspects.
It is possible that humans may be infected with the virus of other animals.
The results of the studies did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, rabbits and rabbits.
There is currently no approved vaccine from the virus or medicinal product for his or her treatment.
Various international studies on vaccines and medicines from COVID-19 are being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO launched the SOLIDARITY Trial Programme (Solidarnosti Test), which was designed to assess the health impact of the four existing associations that are considered most effective today.
The vaccine is not yet available, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidate preparations.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are found in human cells using ACE2 receptors, so the results of previous studies under SARS-CoV are used in scientific development.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers are trying to create a targeted viral vaccine.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, is aimed at prompt human immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the establishment of a single vaccine, is aimed at creating a vaccine that enhances the sensitivity of the immune system to certain sub-virus units.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are aimed at the destruction of the S-chipo-white, which helps the virus to penetrate the ACE2 plant receptor.
The third strategy is the development of a vaccine based on nuclear acids (NNCs or RNCs, new vaccines).
Experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies should be checked for safety and effectiveness. The first clinical trial against four volunteers was launched in Seattle on 16 March 2020.
The vaccine contains a free genetic code copied from the virus that causes disease. Anti-temperature was identified as one of the potential problems in the development of the vaccine from SARS-COV-2, but this assumption was controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials were conducted as of April 2020.
Preparations approved for malaria treatment were evaluated during seven trials, four of which were hydrochloricinated or chloroquine.
The re-profiling of anti-virus preparations is mostly Chinese studies; nine round-the-clock studies were conducted in several countries by the end of April.
A dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidacy for the treatment of COVID-19 was conducted in April 2020. To that end, several other existing antiviral medicinal products for the treatment of COVID-19, including redesivir, chloroxin and hydrochlorothiazide, lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as lopinavir/ritonavir, are also considered in combination with beta interferon.
As of March 2020, there are preliminary data on the effectiveness of the rhedesivir application.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with rdesivir as an exception.
Phase III of clinical trials is already taking place in the United States, China and Italy. The use of chlorine previously used for malaria treatment was considered in China in February 2020 and there are preliminary results.
However, there is a need for an expert evaluation of the study.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chlorine.
The Hungarian Institute of Virus recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that the double dose is very dangerous and can lead to a sudden outcome.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA granted authorisation for the extreme use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquinine for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. The Chinese versions of the 7th edition also refer to interferons, ribavirin or mifenevir as a means against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inject SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanid was recommended for a detailed in vivo study, demonstrated induction of SARS-CoV-2 in low concentrations, and studies have shown that a white layer of TMPRS-CoV-2 is needed to detect SARS-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptors.
Studies of the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without asytromicin have serious restrictions that do not allow the medical community to use these treatments without further examination. Ozeltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytamines may occur as complications in later stages of severe form COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquinine may have hypercytokine properties, as a result of a recent study carried out by the National Health Commission of China, the recommendation for the treatment of coronavirus was included in tocilizumab.
This preparation rose to 2 stages of an unmanaged test carried out at the national level in Italy after the positive results of its use in patients with a severe form of disease were obtained.
In combination with the analysis of blood flow on ferritin to detect cytokines, it is intended to counteract factors that are considered to be the cause of death in some patients.
In 2017 the FDA was approved as an interlequin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective thematic studies for the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokines syndrome, due to another reason, the T-cell therapy of the CAR.
Today there are no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective means of treating cytokine release syndrome.
The transmission of clean and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients treated with COVID-19 is currently considered a non-vaccinative method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested in the treatment of patients from SARS, but its results have been uncertain.
The neutralization of the virus is the expected effect by which passive anti-inflammatory therapy can provide protection from SARS-CoV-2.
However, it is possible to use other mechanisms, such as antithetological cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive antithesis therapy, such as monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
Reconvalence of blood can be increased, consisting of a liquid part of the blood of healthy patients and contains an anti-virus.
