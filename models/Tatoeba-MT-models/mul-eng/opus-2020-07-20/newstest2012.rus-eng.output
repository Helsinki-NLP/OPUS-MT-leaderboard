Parliament does not support the amendment granting freedom to Timoshenko
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament, in its amendment to the Code of Criminal Procedure, rejected the attempt to repeal the article by which the opposition leader, Julia Timoshenko, was convicted.
The amendment, which would lead to the release of the former Prime Minister in prison, was rejected during the second reading of the Bill on the Elimination of Economic Crimes.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was recognized as ineffective.
The sentence is not yet final; the court will consider the appeal of Timoshenko in December.
Timoschenko claims that the sentence is a political place of order; the process in the West has also been challenged in advance.
The proposal to repeal article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which the former Prime Minister had been convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes in favour.
Livija's victory
In the history of liberation or the resurrection, Libya has already lost.
Muammar Qadfi is buried somewhere in the desert, without him the war is over.
It's time to identify winners.
In general, Islamists are winning the country; whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government declared itself to be a follower of the Normal Law of Sharia, which we have already heard.
Libya will become a country without crime, as punishment for theft is a cut-off.
Women may forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be punished; etc.
Rather than a dictator of society consisting of rival clans, the Qur'an will be united.
In Libya there will be a order that we can't imagine, which we would hardly have wanted.
In any case, our pattern of life is not the only one in its kind, nor would it be better and more likely to come to the people of Libya, for example.
In fact, it is surprising that Muslims have received help from disbelievers.
Their only argument is that NATO did not lead the people of the United States, but Allah, whom they praised after they had been defeated, has guided them.
And if you're looking for winners in Libya, the West doesn't belong to them.
We took part in shootings, served Islam, and our policies escaped from the dictator, their political allies, without any guarantee of any advantage.
In view of recent tragic experiences with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to withdraw from the military occupation of Libya.
The local population should therefore not be concerned about the removal of the “Cretans”.
Even without occupation, do oil companies get black Libya's gold virtually worthless?
Sooner or later, they won't get it, and then the West will finally be able to break free from the protection of civil rights.
If only Sharia's followers don't end this.
A new wave of crisis begins
France and the rest of Europe are currently in the focus of investors.
The statistical storm took place in Europe on Tuesday.
Some countries have developed GDP data in 3 quarters.
Compared to the previous quarter of the Czech economy, Germany and France have shown growth.
Still, the long market is going to be a record today.
Investors are not only looking at Italy; they are now focusing on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The Statistical Offices of the Eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have made their preliminary assessments of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5 per cent; France by 0.4 per cent.
Both countries also adjusted data on the second quarter, in which Germany was better off than expected (up to 0.3 per cent instead of 0.1 per cent). France reported a slight decrease in 0.1 per cent (meaning information was expected).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy had seen a preliminary increase of 1.5 per cent.
However, compared to the previous quarter of GDP, the Czech statistical office confirmed the trend of gradual slowing down of economic growth.
The results were worse than predicted by analysts.
Key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy had seen a preliminary increase of 1.5 per cent; however, it was in a position relative to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany's third quarter grew by 0.5 per cent.
From July to September, the economy, both Eurozone and the European Union, showed growth compared to the previous quarter to 0.2 per cent, which corresponds to the estimates of analysts.
Greece's economy has shown a preliminary decrease of 5.2 per cent.
The income of the 10-year bond is 28.45 per cent.
Access to both Italian and Spanish obligations is critical.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium have begun to experience difficulties.
Despite the deterioration of the situation in the region, the income of Czech 1 year old bonds remains about 4 per cent.
In Germany, the ECB is the last creditor to save the situation.
The Czech Republic has passed a committee in EURO.
In Montenegro they won by 1:0 and celebrated an unexpected cash prize of 200 million.
The National Team has successfully met the most complex task of the season!
Thanks to the great Cheho and the beautiful cave of Peter Iraček they won with account 1:0.
In the second team, the Czech team had the pleasure of maintaining a significant advantage after the domestic response match, and it would participate again in the European Championships.
IHNED.cz watched the match and drew up a detailed report.
Practically nothing remarkable in the first team and great success in the second.
The Czech National Assembly, in part because of the attack of the team at the end; the Great Czech; and the Heroic Iraq; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated the departure of the European Championship.
The excessive defence of the Czech team enabled the Montenegro team to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damianovic and Vacunic became the most successful couple of matches after they lost two great opportunities.
The Great Peter Chech is one reason why the Czech National Assembly will not miss the European Championship next year, and the Czech football will thus earn about 200 million Czech crowns.
The first minute of the game was very tense.
Both teams were trying to make combinations; most of the time, they went to the center of the field.
This also explains the lack of pressure by the first team of managers, and further attacks on the defence line were taken by Czech defenders.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country ' s nuclear programme.
They've created a living wall.
Several hundred students of the University have created a living wall around the nuclear power plant in Iran.
They would therefore like to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible attack by Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon after the student’s prayers before entering the building, he followed a petition about the death of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students have created a living wall around the Isfahan Uran Corridor.
They thus demonstrated their willingness to protect the nuclear programme of their country at the cost of their own lives.
In its latest report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that Iran had not given up its efforts to acquire nuclear weapons.
The possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday, following the student prayers before entering the Isfahanan Uran Institute, the petition for the death of both the United States and Israel was followed.
In the event of an attack aimed at the maximalization of the Iranian nuclear programme, the objectives, according to Israeli press, will be to establish both in Isfahan and Nathanez, where uranium mining is being carried out.
Question of children who suffer from breast-feeding: No breakfast and lunch
More than three children between the ages of 9 and 13 are more regular; while 9 per cent of schoolchildren have an extra weight, 5 per cent suffer from pregnancy.
According to one recent study, children who suffer from breast cancer usually come from families who lead an unhealthy life.
We see again the importance of the environment and models of conduct that unites the human being for his or her health development.
For example, it appears on the table of children who suffer from breast cancer almost twice as often as in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of children who suffer from ovarian cancer are free to initiate an examination of the educational activity under the name of Burns.
Moreover, the families of children suffering from ageing are not involved in sports, but this is true of most modern schoolchildren - only 15 per cent of the children said that their parents had time to play sports as a minimum once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was held at the end of last year’s course; it involved nearly 900 students from early classes throughout Bohemia.
This was not the case in the second year, with the support of the insurance company General Health Insurance and Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 students from 4 to 8 classes have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and adequate sports load are the main determinants that cause the number of children who suffer from excessive weight or fatigue.
"For example, only half of the respondents said they eat five times a day on the breakfast-percus-lanc-pecker-nuginal schedule, and that is one of the unpredicted conditions of proper food," says one study.
No lance and dinner club
Experts warn that even relative details such as regular family breakfast are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 per cent of schoolchildren are enrolled together.
In most families, all are separated.
It has become more evident that people in every 10 families do not get involved at all.
And yet tomorrow is the basis for proper day-to-day reasoning.
The study showed that burned food is used more often in families with children who suffer from breast cancer.
Nearly every drink, regardless of weight, is five sweet drinks every day (70 per cent).
Although more than 40 per cent of children are regularly engaged in sports, this figure is reduced by more than two to 15 per cent when it comes to their parents.
Build your own menu.
In another part of the study, (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were offered their own menu based on the products offered and based on their tastes and preferences.
"Privacy in Czech children 12-15 years of age is far from the idea of healthy food."
Their favorite food includes a large number of bitter, meaty, and sweet bread.
“Special concern is the popularity of sweet cold drinks,” said the final part of the study.
As a major compounded herd, the bird has won a small transfer.
However, children have virtually no interest in baby, fish and flowering.
Healthy Life - Styles
The study also showed that children would be willing to change their eating habits if they would be provided with relevant information.
“Many participants in the study control group showed a significant degree of preference for healthy food when they completed the poll following the completion of the burned-out lesson,” the results of the project said.
This was particularly significant, for example, in the case of sweet cold drinks - more children were preferred to drink simply water.
In addition, children have often noticed birds and fish as the main blue, limiting the number of soft blues and whites.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, who claims professionals
In the first article on student training, I visited the level of information on inputs.
I had no idea what was going to happen.
Three expert lessons in this area; advice on the selection of clothes for non-standard figures; and a seminar on how all this works in real life.
More, more.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
Training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really busy.
This time we discussed with Alenko, the director (no man at the course) how to dress a woman whose body is not ideally symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
In one short form, in another boy's figure without proper shape, one has more rules.
The stylist must know how to reduce the width, remove the shadow, or add insufficient amounts.
We were advised to highlight the figure of women such as Jennifer Lopez, that is, the owner of a more beautiful chest and thigh and neck, and not to wear them too attractive.
For example, if the difference in the size of the plate and the bead is so large that I cannot pick a shoe or a belt, I must have at least one thing on the order.
You obviously don't want the money you've put in, because the ideal seating suit is worthless.
You'll feel much better in the jumbo that comes from the order, you'll feel better than the one who's always coming up, you'll get tired, you'll get drunk, you'll get drunk, you'll get drunk, you'll get drunk, you'll get drunk, you'll get drunk, you'll get drunk, you'll get drunk, you'll get drunk, you'll get drunk, you'll get drunk, you'll get drunk, you'll get drunk, you'll get drunk, you'll get drunk, you'll get drunk, you'll get drunk, you'll get drunk, you know, you'll get drunk, you'll get drunk, you'll get drunk, you know, you'll get a lot better.
Men's figures, on the other hand, can wear clothes with pinks, applications, hats or bags.
Given the abundance of such information and figures, I am pleased that I have a whole week to realize it all.
And yet, I'm afraid it's too much, taking into account the homework we've got.
Each participant had to think twice for any feature: day and night.
We need to take into account their modern appearance, their style in clothing and the type of figure.
I have to wear Miranda Kerr, which you can know about Victoria's Secret advertising campaigns.
I am happy about myself because her dress is much easier than I'm saying, Britney Spears, Christina Aguiller, who has recently adjusted to the tone (please be aware that I am superior), or quite young Selen Gomes.
We need to extract a garment from the magazines or find it on the Internet, print and process it using graphics programs.
Mudbold, called the result of the work, then reflects our own style and relation to the graphic image.
It's important to keep your head in a graphic composition style.
The stylist not only dresss real people, but creates product pages in magazines (based on special instructions, such as fashion bags, palm and so on).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Kamennik told us about.
But it was only in the resurrection.
There is a need for common knowledge
The sub-educated lesson on the type of figure was attended by three guests of specialists in this area.
Stylist, Honza Pokorna; fashion designer, Jacob Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
James reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylus to use this fact.
A good stylist will be able to use one item in a different way.
In this case diversity is the key to success.
For example, the pallet can normally be worn on the surface of the gins and football, like the palm; but it can also be worn on the head, without a veil as a payment.
The second option is to hold your hand or lift your back, and the whole picture is completely changing.
"Play with him," he stressed.
In any case, I appreciated the following advice: "You must know the rules for your work."
Then you can start violating them," Jacob told us.
I finally came to understand why we're going to break down all the definitions and rules that we're dealing with and why, when we're often seeing everything else in fashion magazines.
I'm not talking about fashion shows.
From Ben's photo, I knew that the style should have more options than the number of photos he had to make.
Yes, for a fashion review on ten pages (equivalent to ten rows) I must be prepared to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that the painting of the garment often looks and works in conjunction with others rather than in reality.
We must have this in mind when we create an image.
Honza Pokorna has confirmed that the image and style are often half the success.
Just look at Madonna, which doesn't have a beautiful eye, but her image and marketing have turned it into a world star.
The relationship with the stylist services in the Czech Republic is still cold enough.
Even some well-known people often view it as a waste (and believe that it's enough to be a specialist in something and that they look like secondary).
And if someone finally allows us to create their style, we have to wait for them to call us to a different size than what they really are wearing.
Then we go to Google and find out if the tables didn't say anything about any sign of the funeral/poison, etc.
On the resurrection of Honza and Mario, they emphasized that it was not enough for the stylist to understand in fashion and be able to pick up a few.
Our work is mainly made up of people with whom we dress; so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to evaluate people, not create them, and maintain their views.
"If the manager asks you to look at her clothes and add some beautiful things, you can't throw out all her wardrobe, tell her that her clothes are terrible."
"Find even a few things you can praise, and advise that you can carry with them," says Mario.
He also showed us that a work bag should be included specifically.
It's the bag you connect around the waist to carry everything you need.
In addition to the obvious items such as knives, soft-rolled or english cloths, it must contain no nylon (stylists use it with a few items such as a bag or a hat), special clips to strengthen the tyres in case they are too large (buffs and similar items are prohibited because they are wearing clothing) or a kite set.
To get rid of the lesson and get some practical experience, we learned how to make tapes on the toilets.
Even during the dry season in the studio where half of the hunger can be caused by injuries, I don't talk about street droughts.
And here's where we're going.
You don't have to touch the rifles so you don't export them.
This requires this skill.
I'm glad Mario praised my work.
Those skills didn't come from my mind.
It's just part of what we've heard during the second part of the day course.
I'm beginning to understand that being a professional stylist is not as easy as they would say.
V Need for Speed: Flight takes place in America.
Review
What was supposed to be an unannounced delay turned into a routine morning trip to work due to the series of totally inappropriate and uninterrupted errors.
The ambitions to a certain extent were satisfied, but this was not important, since no one clearly wanted to do any other work.
Before the new version was released, there were great hopes.
It was expected to skip the previous series of Need For Speed in the new direction; demonstration versions showed that the game would take a decent place in the genre of the race.
We were excited to see the parts of the game where the main hero went out of the car and ran.
As is often the case with NFS, the result is very different from what we expected.
The game is a rather harmless arcade race, but the overall impression will bear some unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series for many years.
In fact, this is not a mistake, but an inexhaustible link between the developers.
It's starting very well.
You're part of the story, the principal hero, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by taking part in an illegal race through America.
You're sitting in a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your task is to get to New York first.
This idea has a few interesting features.
The route consists of ten phases divided into more than fifty runs.
This means that each race runs along its route, the individual stages go in a variety of and interesting areas.
So there is no sense that the game is always the same.
Although the graph is at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, some traces are pleasant to see.
And yet the game doesn't have strong emotions.
Although driving a car through the desert, it is very nice to have a good reward or to be high in snowy mountains.
In addition, running from time to time brings extraordinary detail.
For example, in the desert you fall into a sandy storm, which is a very low visibility.
On the other hand, the mountains need to be careful not to fall under the lava.
Some races are well organized.
There's a few differences, but that's enough.
Sometimes you try to push a few opponents (usually a normal race); then you try to improve time (a standard race with a second); or you encounter a single opponent.
Besides, from time to time, you are turning to the police, which makes your task even more difficult.
The components are new.
It's just an interactive animation, where most of Jack's time is running away from someone, and you should help him with the necessary buttons at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
Although it is surprising that these fractions are much smaller than you could expect (all three to be accurate).
In fact, this is good for the game because it does not depend on it; given the above, it is one of the things that make the game more interesting.
The clock model is followed by previous models.
This means that it no longer seems to be something special, but it cannot be considered inadequate.
If you're looking for a real life imitation, you'll have to find another place.
However, this driving model is very suitable for dynamic runners, although the market can find better options.
It's all very good.
In time, however, problems arose.
Unlike the driving model, the approach model is not so good.
You don't expect complex transformations and interactions from this game, but if you don't have the idea of contacting the object, how your machine behaves, something's not.
Usually, by pushing or passing without a car in a flat stream, you are sometimes easily affected by another car, and sometimes in a similar situation, your car begins to turn upside down.
Or the enemy broke up.
This is not so important because of the relaunch system, but it's enough to export pleasure.
The breakouts are so that if you break or walk away from the track, the game will bring you back to the point where it broke.
However, only five reboots are available for each race.
If you use them all, you'll have to start a race from the beginning.
It's useful if something doesn't get, but you can't trust it completely.
Sometimes it's not enough for you to run, and you have to learn a certain part of the race.
The important lack of game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some rotations need to be carried out in a certain way, otherwise you will simply not enter.
In other cases, you meet civil vehicles at a certain location in the same configuration, regardless of whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially reflected in situations where you see how your opponent easily walks between the two engines moving in the opposite direction, when when you are there, the machines are already in place so that you need to cut them or cut the speed.
It doesn't matter when you meet them; everything is set so that the situation always happens before your nose.
Opposers have other advantages.
During the game, you discover several places where, regardless of time, the same opponent forces you in the same place.
This is especially evident at the end of the game, at the long bridge where you go in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent must stand before you in spite of anything.
The fact that when he eats in front of you, he makes you look at one or more accidents in this place.
You can understand the attempt to make a game more interesting and full of adrenaline, but it is so obvious that it quickly starts to cause disappointment.
Sorry, because despite the simple model of driving, the game is interesting and sometimes so tense that you have no time to pay attention to what is going on around you.
It doesn't matter what makes you jump -- a concept with fifty unique strokes, track sequences, or something else.
The idea of changing a car during a race is unusual.
You need to follow the instructions on the way, because that is why your car can change, despite the fact that in most cases what you already have is enough.
The machines are divided into three categories.
Sports machines are suitable for cities; powerful American machines are for direct cuttings; and exotic super-ports for technical driving, for example, on hilly tracks.
The main mode of story mode is closely related to the challenge mode; it's the individual places run that you know about the game.
Here you play for your personal work, both medals and glasses, common for the schemes and stories.
Many options are available for higher driving levels: starting from the car and finishing the profile.
In addition, the profile related to the Autolog online function, which, besides all else, compares the results you have achieved with the results of other games, and provides connections to the public.
There is another lack of understanding; this is an example of the last race in sequence.
You and your car fall into a tunnel of metro (we'll think that's where you're sleeping on the streets in the dark (we'll think so).
Your spidometer shows numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (we will think so) when suddenly you are on a subway trip turning your car into a metal chest.
Over the course of a few days, our editors discussed whether, in fact, no one had ever thought about the game, or what it did to us were really sick.
The technical composition of games does not represent anything special; but the overall impression of the video is most pleasant, sometimes even boring.
Although I regret that in some critical moments the quality of the record is sometimes very strong, it is.
This is especially true of events involving a large number of participants, where good records would not be particularly helpful to you.
Sound's fine; soundtrack's on the lover.
In order to accommodate as wide as possible a young audience, the soundtrack 'comes from different styles'; but almost everyone buys the game because of its music.
General impression of Need for Speed: Escape is quite irregular.
If the game were to avoid obvious unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that victory is the best part of NFS in the last few years.
Anyway, the game leaves sense of incompatibility.
Of course, that's a good pleasure, but be prepared that your shortcomings will blind you as the airport projector.
Chores Karlova University will talk at the "Students in the Barhet" concert.
Last third year, the Festival of Festa Academy proposed that the international student's day and anniversary of the Barhat Revolution be combined with the musical event.
It will represent about twenty schools and universities.
The main event of the festival is two concerts, which will be held on 17 November.
"Karlow University is actively participating in the festival."
"The parties include Hor of the faculty of pedagogical and humanitarian science; Waclav Gample, Rector, will come to the committee," said Jacob Challun, head of the organizational committee.
The colony will become a free public concert of school choirs, which will take place on 2 November 17 November before the National Technical Library in Davis.
The production of the Jaze Mass, the production of a famous Czech diamond, Karela Ružicki, is also part of the programme.
Tonight, in the official National House of Vinogradas, there is a "Students in Barhate" concert, with the participation of universities, including Karlov's students.
The objective of the Festa Academy is to clear the International Student Day and to mark the 22nd anniversary of the Barhat Revolution; to present the audience with the music of the highest quality and to develop creative interaction among young people.
The principal organizer is the Czech singing groups (the Czech people) in cooperation with the secondary school named Johannes Kepler.
All the events are taking place with the help of Goduslava Freedom, Lord Prague, and Vaclava Gampla, Rector of Karlova University.

Ambassador to EU Vice-Presidents:
The Czechs have the reputation of non-profits and sceptics in relation to the euro.
"The Lisbon Treaty has caused significant differences between individual organizations."
"I didn't expect such a cruel war."
"It takes five or six years before the situation gets stabilized, calmed and all the games are used to their new role," EU Ambassador Milena Witzenov strongly began his lecture at the legal college.
She proved to the extent to which she held her "Clarified and Open about Europe" in the first part of her lesson, where she described the individual EU institutions and their relations so simply and clearly that many lecturers from the legal college of the CU would be disappointed.
Moreover, Vienna commended the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompei:
"The critics began to say that it was a traditional sara, an official mouse that could not play any role; I must say, everything was damaged as well as it did its role."
"The person who can listen to twenty-seven parties at the same time is very well acquainted with them and has a clear idea of the way in which the EU needs to develop."
She explained her new position on international relations and security issues as a response to the question, "Who is the European Union? What number do I need to call?" i.e. the important step towards the unification and greater transparency of the Union's policies with regard to countries such as China and India.
No one's going to ban our cheese.
The prize has continued to focus on a programme that is key to the EU in the past, in the present and in the near future.
She called the Czech Presidency successful last year.
The Czechs were dealing with the prevailing financial crisis; they were overcoming the crisis and organizing the East Partnership Summit.
She said that the rejection of the Government at that time was a negative phenomenon that caused the small damage to the Czech Republic.
The Czech representatives in the EU are currently very busy.
As said by the Ambassador and the Presidency, and the next financial crisis have brought about an ongoing stalemate.
It is also necessary to adopt a new EU seven-year budget, which is very simple, taking into account the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be fragile and economic, which areas will be preferred; which countries will receive more and less support; all these issues are in the future programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans she brought to Brussels: "O Europe, the language of understanding".
“I really don’t like the cuts, the foreign words and the jargon that no one understands.
How citizens can understand that people in Brussels are not trying to sell red or round corners, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our cheese.'
It also aims to make more efficient use of the EU environment and to attract more Czechs to the European organization.
Multispeed Europe is our future
The apostle claims that the Czechs consider them to be Euro-Sceptics, as well as the people who notice that they are more negative than the positive sides of the substance.
She wants more Czech representatives to be included in the European organization.
She believes that there are several factors in this guilt: for example, the humility of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time with little support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful presidency of the Czech Republic, it noted the power and cooperation of the High-Greece Group.
"Make sure that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and the word joins us, the French say to me, "Hey, what about the assembly again, the High-class Group?" and he doesn't like it either.
In the future, the Union of Vienna looks forward to major new strict rules for the budgetary policy of States parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considers the idea of double-speed, unless it is more realistic for a multi-speed Europe.
"We have both countries inside and outside Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area, and we already have an institution for enhanced cooperation."
"First, it was said that those countries that wanted to unite should be united, while those who did not want could remain on the side."
“The number of such institutions will grow; this will be a two-speed Europe,” Witzenov expects.
In this regard, it stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompei in the promotion of rules whereby all EU-wide issues should be discussed by all States parties, not just those in Eurozone.
brand history:
The novelist IBM enters the second century of his existence.
If someone wants to find a word that best expresses the IMB strategy, it's probably "long".
For the general public IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered to be very modern, although it was founded over a hundred years ago.
The company's debt was secured by its first boss, the dreamer Thomas J. Watson.
He believed in his vision that many world problems could be solved easily if people wanted to think.
His logo "Dome!" thus became a stamp that developed the life of the future giant (also called his internal journal, which IMB started publishing in 1935).
More than that, it was the foundation of a corporate culture that Watson clearly expressed.
"For us in IBM, long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and thrived for a hundred years because she remained faithful to her significant values, even though she was not afraid to change everything around her.
In our first century, this allowed us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second century, we hope to reach even more," said current company leader Samuel J. Palmisano in the case of Jubilee.
Compliant system
In the 1930s, Watson came to the point of concern about workers like Batya in the Czech Republic, IMB, among the first US employees with paid leave, insurance from the employer, elegant uniform and complex bonus system for better buyers and entrepreneurs.
The same are the long-term relations of IBM with consumers.
From the very beginning, the company had been using talented people, one of the first companies in the world to eliminate all discrimination that had given it a great choice.
The anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan are in line with which women, Virginia Rometti, will be replaced by Palmizano next year.
She worked in IBM for thirty years; she is currently a sales, marketing and development director.
Over the past few years IBM has organized meetings with online brainstorms, with many future innovations.
It's amazing that ideas are very much in the company of about half a million people.
Organization with a good reputation
The firm's strong position in business is a strong internal and external image.
"From the very beginning, IBM's concept was rather an organization rather than a technological company," said Professor Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Canter.
"IIBM is not a technology company, it is a company that helps solve business problems with technology," added George Colony from Forrester Research, consultant.
According to the company itself, there is a difference between going to the market and creating it.
For a hundred years IBM, or the Global Giant, as it is called in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the world's largest companies.
It seems that this is the most universal technology company - developing equipment and software; infrastructure; hosting and advisory services - from servers to nanotechnology.
It has the largest number of patents among all American technology companies, and five of its staff have received the Nobel Prize.
Its findings include, for example, a banknote, a bank card, a financial swap, a bank code and a discrepancy.
With 220 billion dollars, according to market capitalization, IBM this year became the second largest technology company (the first place on Apple) to Microsoft since 1996.
Look Forward
Not all of its products have been tasted by buyers and entered into the era. For example, IBM suffered failure with its OS/2 operating system; Prodigy online service and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is determined by move forward, you can't be emotionally tied to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM easily lays the foundations on several platforms - if they don't work, it's giving up.
For example, it differs from its Microsoft competitor, which builds and survives the fall on Windows, its operating system.
Perspective technology
The main income of IBM comes from services, about one fifth from computer programs and equipment.
At the time, in 1990, she was the most powerful company in the manufacturing industry.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets of $15 billion, while placing 58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
It continued investment even after 2008 when the current economic crisis first hit the world.
IBM followed the example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment in the year of the Great Depression.
Until IBM seems to have caused the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, IBM's share price has increased by 120 per cent; the company's net wage has grown steadily.
The corporate currency of IBM is to change everything except its own values.
So it can be expected that even if another crisis occurs, this mild giant will be able to deal with the situation.
History of IBM: from raw knife to space flights.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago. Its original name was "Circulation Corporation, Tabulations and Records" was quite complex.
She took the name IBM in 1924, which was the brand used for Canada and South America's offices.
The foundation of the future IBM was laid by four companies whose history began in the 1880s.
They had technologies such as the legendary "table time" times, i.e. fixed times when staff came and went out of work.
The architect of the new company was a businessman, Charles Ranlet Flint, who also led the Board of Trustees of the Company by 1930.
Flint, director of the competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him manage the company.
The leader then deduced IBM's founder into the darkness - the ideas of Watson - remain the basis for undisputed corporate culture and individuality.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as it is clear from the name, began to manufacture and sell various equipment for business - from raw knives and bags to cassettes.
In the first four years, the Utson leadership doubled to nine million dollars, and a massive expansion of the company began on all continents.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later he took his son, Thomas Watson-young.
Under its guidance IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technology and established the first language of programming.
In 1960, both IBM staff and computers helped NASA control space flights in Mercurie, Saturn, and in 1969 human flight in Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first computer family - IBM line System/360.
The classic PC, which established computer standards at that time, called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold the production of computers of the Chinese company Lenovo, at the same time purchased the PricewaterhouseCoopers consulting office, thus giving full attention to consultation and services with high added value.
Over the past three years IBM has achieved great success with its concept of Smarter Planet.
Its objective is to make sound use of technologies in areas where this has not yet been planned and to improve road conditions and urban governance.
In the area of trade IBM has recently presented the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps businessmen to control the entire trading cycle.
IBM's traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country in central and eastern Europe, IBM founded its office in 1932.
Today IBM CZ also manages the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The Central and Eastern European headquarters is located in Prague, where a global research group is also working on the language.
An accountant of her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, leave yourself alone, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richterzhova (53) said it was all over!
After her husband, Joseph Richter (53), became a television producer and lover of Ivet Bartoshev (45), Darina still hoped that he would come home.
Nevertheless, she no longer wants to wait, and she has set clear rules for her future life.
"The Pope can come home, but not as my partner anymore," explained Richter.
When Darina Richtaržova died in her home of Bartosh's blood, she probably had no idea what was going to happen to her marriage.
And even though she stopped him from coming out of Richan 30 days later, Pepa didn't leave the song.
More than that, he publicly acknowledged that he loved her.
After some time, Darina fell down and made her feel comfortable with the Roman husband, and now she finally apologized to him.
I'll figure out who his wife is sleeping with.
Even if Richter and Bartosh ever leave, his wife won't accept him with scattered charges.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will drive him away."
"But he will end his days not as my beloved, lost, and found old, and the man with whom I have something to do with me," said Richterjo, adding that she has already been freed from her husband and insists only on mutual virtues.
Until Joseph had nothing to do with his wife’s rejection of him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Yvet, I'm not going to change it."
"My wife decided to leave a marriage on the book, and I respect that decision."
"Our Union continues to function; I'm responsible for repairs, repairs, repairs, home and shopping."
"Darina and I are perfectly normal, only we don't share the post anymore," said Richard Blesk, magazine.
He claims that if Richard finds a new love, he won't interfere with it.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she's going with anyone else if she has a friend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Ivet and I'll take full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
Women's Admonitions: Are they touching you?
When you ask men to name some typical female bad habits, they usually list them all immediately.
Dear ladies, do you know yourself in the following lines describing a few women's habits that prevent men from committing evil?
Skipping
Your second half complains that you're always on the way to the store?
You need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like shopping for big sales?
If so, your shopping can be considered a stupid habit.
Some women admit that they need to control their passion for shopping.
And who is there among you who would turn away from the adornments of garments in search of ornaments, and would have used them (in various ways) in the likenesses?
Maybe shopping is a hobby for most women, but for men it can be the same one.
Just remember how many times you told your second half to wait for you to get married...
An Immortal Disagreement
"I'm too fat?"
"I need to get rid of at least five kilograms -- maybe I'm starting to make a gym?"
"Are you still coming to me?"
Do you know these phrases?
Yeah?
Then you join a group of women who are mixed in their outward appearance.
You don't have to stop following yourself, but many men literally have an allergic reaction to constant complaints from their outside partners.
The strong gender also agrees that the more complaints arise, the more women express themselves.
Most important order and purity
It's like an endless story.
My stomach, my stomach, my stomach, my stomach, my urine, my urine cleaning -- at least twice a week.
Do you criticize your partner for coming to a clean coffee shop in dirty boots; children in clean gloves and fingerprints on a fireplace in a guest that was so hard to clean?
If you are suffering from this "disaster", try to realize that it is too bad to fall; and that your family rules and cleanliness should not be the first place.
Unprecedented efforts to be clean can threaten your relationship as well as your entire family.
Team to command
"Brease white in the crown."
"Are you going to put on your dirty boots tomorrow?"
"The soft-fashioned vests shall not lie on the floor."
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, he can be very helpful.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want it to be perfect.
Maybe if men understood that, women wouldn't have to command them so often...
Fill
Some women would like to sneeze, upset, and panic attacks against others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to talk about who, where, and why.
Time from time to time, it's likely that each of us is breaking loose.
We'll be open, that's the most visible nature of all women.
In any case, there are more severe networks, women who are often browsing and prefer the rest, especially in the women's working group, who are at risk of their environment.
The results of the Jaguar and Varaček transfers helped Philadelphia to win
During the NHL match on Monday, two successful transfers of the hockey attacker Jaromir Jagro helped Philadelphia win 5:3 on the throne, and it was again the most successful Czech match game.
In both cases, Claude Giru used the experience of a thirty-nine-year-old star; he added another transfer and was announced as a better match player.
Two successful match transfers were also owned by a player in a team with Yagro Yabubu Varaček.
After her mother, Jagger, told foreign journalists that he had predicted a great evening.
"I told him to the match that he'd kill a hit-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel that way," said Jagger, after his actions Jiro killed his head at the first chance he gave Fleers.
Shortly after the second round, the team also had a "cash track".
The closing Harriensens Varaček took control of the boat and handed it over to Maxim Talbot, who killed between the circles.
In the second before the first break, Patrick Dwyer reduced the gap with a number of advantages, but at the beginning of the second time, he took up the Flashes.
Especially Jiru.
Following the successful delivery of Jagra, he killed the third round; his next attack was transformed into the fourth round by Wayne Simmonds.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't mean to say that he's the best game of the game, but he's just going into three better ones," said Jagger, commending his center.
"I never thought I'd end my career with a hockey game like him."
"It makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in NHL, my teammates have tried to help me, and now my order has come up," he added.
The Queen made the match more dramatic with the help of Toomo Ruutu and the Dwiera Penalties, reducing the gap to one floor.
Further difficulties prevented Matt Reed, who increased the gap between two eyes.
"Pronger was doing great in our area."
"He hit on his hat, I jumped, and Reid moved to the far end."
"I'm looking forward to it and I'm glad it worked," Varaček described his impression from the last round of the match.
The victory led Philadelphia to the first place in the Eastern Conference.
The protector of the Montreal team, Yaroslav Spaček, did not finish the match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to the trauma of the upper body.
Together with an experienced Canadian protector, they lost their double advantage and lost 2:3 after the panel.
Thomas Plekanez couldn't kill one of them during the attack.
More than lost eyes, the home trainer was injured by a large number of injuries in the back row, since the match ended with five guards.
"The situation is bad."
"We ended up with only one game of experience, the rest of us were young people."
"No matter what, we can't deal with it, we just need to calm down with it," said Jack Martin.
"The replacement, it was a bit different, and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the hat out of our zone."
"What was our weak side," added P.K.Subban.
After the 30th attack by Czech golfer Andy Paulez helped Winnipegs win Tampa Bay 5:2.
High Jets, who stopped the fifth series of attacks, were killed by five different games.
Price dynamic for travel since 1989
By 1989 only five state tourism agencies could work in the former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Since travel to the West was severely restricted, tourism agencies at the time were mainly selling tourists in the countries of the socialist block.
Thus, Czech tourists went to the Canyon in the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea, Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries at the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime returned to the West, resulting in significant restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The biggest paradox of the socialist period was that citizens of the socialist block (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed to travel on their own by socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to go on his own, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, a written invitation was needed from that country; otherwise, individual travel was impossible.
At the time, tourist agencies offered to travel to the West, but they had to stand around all night with a sleeping mask or having a "good friends" in the agency.
And that wasn't all.
The currency was required to travel to the West, and it was not granted to political untrustworthy people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czech currency was not freely converted; it was not possible to obtain funds (the Western currency) for travel to the West without a currency permit.
Most of the Czechs have made their leave of home, resulting in a large number of cassettes and summer houses, which are still in practice today.
After 1989, tourism in Chechnya thus experienced the current revolution.
While travel in the GDR or Bulgaria was the culmination of our journeys by 1989, 4.5 million trips in countries around the world have been undertaken in the past year.
The great paradox, which we no longer know, was that we were unable to visit the most popular in Croatia by 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
In the beginning of 1990, the need for visas in the neighbouring countries of Western Europe was abolished, which led to the start of a huge wave of short trips mainly in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechs were never able to travel to the West, and they all wanted to go there, even though it was a move.
In Paris, for example, Czech tourists slept in parks, as their income did not then catch a hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of Czech tourism during that period was the desire to bring its own food (conservatives, salts, etc.) to save money.
Another important moment is the introduction of a freely converted Czech crown. After decades our tourists can finally buy a Western currency free of charge.
Our standard of living and average income grew, which led to another important situation about 1997.
Since 1997, an increase in demand has enabled tourism agencies to prepare regular flights carried out by air carriers.
By the end of the 1990s, no visa was needed to visit virtually all the developed world countries except the United States, which made our journey even easier.
The following significant events in the post-resurrection travel history took place in 2000, leading to the historic first straight journey from the Czech Republic to the exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct hijackings have brought Czech tourists to hot exotic countries, and this summer flight from the Czech Republic will be sent on twelve exotic routes.
Currently, about 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another important event of this period, which symbolized our post-conflict development, took place in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States rejected the need for visas for Czech tourists, and our country thus has always joined the most developed world countries.
For the first time in the history of 2008, more than half of the Czechs had been allowed to leave abroad (50.3%); for the first time in history they spent over 15,000 human dollars on leave abroad, including their costs in the assignment.
The General Assembly must elect the President, and the threat of the road returns.
For about five months, there was no president in the Czech football, and there was a risk that the successor, Ivan Gashek, head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), would not be named after another extraordinary general assembly, which will be held in Nimburg on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on the rules of the elections to follow.
Without that, no vote will be taken by one of the three candidates.
Indrich Rahl, Miroslav Pelt and Thomas Pacli are eager to lead the Czech football.
Gašek left his post in June, and he invited his colleagues to join him and find a strong person who would lead a soccer team in the future.
However, the age of Gashek once again pushed the football between the two boards of the association, which could not choose a single candidate.
This was apparently on September 16, when a new president was to be elected.
General Assembly members visited the National House in Prague, Smile, as negotiations remained blocked, not just the electoral procedure.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only legal representatives or officials who had been authorized.
Since then, this period has been partly regulated by the recommendations of the Institute of State and Law, which makes it impossible for a delegation based on the powers granted.
Concerns about electoral rules, however, continue.
The Executive Board is also not too helpful, although in its congregations, both regular and extraordinary, it is primarily involved in this matter.
The presentation of voting methods has changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is: How to go to the 3rd round and avoid the path?
“The task is to follow established rules or find another model,” said one of the Vice-Presidents of FAČR Dusan Freedom, who represents a professional football in the management of the association.
On the basis of the model provided for by the Constitution, the winner of the round 3 is a candidate who has received much support from the Chamber from which he is a candidate.
It is claimed that Moravia agreed to compromise that it was the winner of the candidates' elections with the largest number of speakers in both Chambers.
The Czech side insists that, in a general percentage, the winner should have two thirds of the votes cast.
“However, the two previous rounds would then lose their meaning; this would completely reject the concept of the two chambers,” the Freedom agreed with the evidence of Moravia, saying that it would be better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with the existing rules.
Some unexpectedly, Thomas Paclik agrees with his opinion, although the evaluation of the rules of elections, as defined by the Constitution, is affecting Pelt more than other candidates.
"I would like the elections to go up to the highest level."
“I want to avoid the sheer folly of representing as in the previous General Assembly,” said the owner of Victoria Plzeň, who was the first candidate; and in his statements he was essentially against Pelte.
Pelta remains an optimist.
He believed that the new President would be known in Hamburg; he hoped that future candidates would work constructively.
“All emotional movement will be relieved after today’s expected departure from the national assembly at the European Championship.”
"The football will be again in a happy mood, people will be more willing to cooperate," said the representative of Jablonez, and from three candidates he has more experience in football management both at the professional and regional levels.
Paradise is more narrow.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very different."
"It's not between the representatives of Godemia and Moravia, but there's an attempt to adapt the rules with an intention."
"It may cause another disturbance in the general congregation."
"I hope a healthy sense will win," said Rachel.
There was not much time left for the parties to reach agreement.
According to some reports, certain negotiations went directly to Montenegro, but who knows whether football unity will be achieved before the match.
The additional journey, which was to be delivered by the Vice-Presidents of Daliber Kucheru and Rahl in Podgorica, did not leave Prague the next morning because of technical error, and they sought an alternative to deliver a part of the executive committee to the re-playing board.
At the end of the ministerial meeting, expected in the middle, may be decisive.
The Minister for Education, Youth and Sport, Joseph Dobesh, would like the parties to the most powerful sport association in the country to come to an agreement.
The map has many: government subsidies; football credit; and the planned ČSTV General Assembly with a new Czech sport address after Sazki's financial problems.
Paclic is engaged in a presidential fight because he does not see the appropriate candidate
If, before the extraordinary general meeting of the head of footballists, the President of the Czech Republic (FAČR) had seen a strong candidate who would comply with all his demands to the President of the Football Association (FAČR), he would not even claim a high position.
"If I were a worthy candidate, I would fight for him and not take part in the fight myself."
"But this man has not been found before," said Paclich ČTK.
The motivation of the Paclica to engage in the struggle against the Prince of Peace and the Indrian Paradise is to try to prevent Pelte, the supposed favor of the elections, from joining the FAČR.
Furthermore, the Pacific stresses that in the event of victory, he will remain the president only until 2013 when the regular general assembly is planned.
In the future, he would like this post to be held by an experienced football manager, not too related to football life.
"I talked to a few people who could be in the picture."
"I was afraid to hear some of them say they don't even want to have a relationship with a Czech football right now."
"I'd like to change that," he said.
At present, the main difference between Paclica and Pelto is with the latest relations with Roman Berbro, president of the regional football association in Plzene. Berber is a man of opposition reputation, known as the influential lobbyist who is able to influence the voices of the delegates of the entire congregation.
Pacli, therefore, considers it unacceptable that Pelta should be president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged, and the football will not move forward."
"With the support of Berbra, a capable businessman, it would be even more harmful for football," Pacli said.
He pointed to the fact that a few years ago the name of Pelt was recorded during the hearing of the telephones during the investigation of corruption; the sentence was successfully avoided.
"I don't know which prize of the victory of Pelt would bring a football."
"And how do we look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclic, now he does not mention his earlier statement that he "sales Plyzn Club if Pelta becomes president."
If Pacli wins in Thursday, he could cooperate with Pelto in the future.
This view is divided by another candidate, Rachel, whom Paclic supported before the general assembly in September, which ended in the Fiscal.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd ever come to."
'He's very capable.'
"I can introduce him to the head of the collection."
"But he can't manage the association."
"I am also not too naked for what I don't understand," said Paclic, who drew a lot of attention to himself in September when he supported the removal of the judicial brigade, led by Man Macello, who changed Dagmar Damkov.
Paklik claims he will risk managing the association.
He recalled his experience with the management of private companies; he had been running the Plyzen team since last summer, which with his help opened his first triumph in the league.
"I have the power to stop the football environment from changing, to support it for the best."
"Restricting the influence of certain groups of people who are willing to influence the disciplinary and appeal council, which leads to adverse situations," said Pacli. He did not hide his anticipation, for example, to the Director of the Sparta Daniel Cržetinsk.
One of its priorities will strengthen the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which it will assist in the highest political level in the allocation of more money for sport from lottery collections.
"This is one of the key points for the new president to take up."
"If taxes are imposed on gambling, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly state where money goes," he said.
Pacli does not consider his connection with the Plezny Club to be a burden, although he claims that President FAČR should be independent.
Pelta's related to the Jablonese, and Rachel's with the Praz Duclay.
"It's not an ideal option."
"And yet I don't see any sense in the personal transfer of my shares to the Pluj club, someone else, once I'm going back there in six months," Pacli says.
Pelta promised new FAČR rules to avoid the Path of Election
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if they chose him, he would fight for new FAQR rules in order to avoid future electoral disputes.
Before the negotiations in Nimburg on Thursday, Jablonec's staff remains optimistic and believes that the pre-election struggle will draw attention to today's expected success in our football collection.
Prior to the elections in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus on both missions and financial resources.
He decided to take part in the elections at the last moment before the last general assembly, so a two-month delay could be useful for him to keep his ideas on football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been in football for a long time, and they expect the president to be known in Thursday."
"They feel that now is the time for someone to take the lead in the association," a person who is primarily associated with the Jablonez club; but he has spent many years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Association.
This gives him reason to assume that he's experienced enough to manage a Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by the ephere that reigned during the reign of Ivan Gashek.
"Unfortunately, the rules that were not as perfect as we thought all were adopted at the General Assembly in June."
"If the various forms of representation had not been adopted, we would have been president since September," Pelta said.
He referred to a key document of the Civil Association as a false purpose for delegates.
"If I become president, I will consider this my personal task, and I am going to take on my personal responsibility if this attempt seems unsuccessful."
"It is a fundamental issue without which we cannot exist," says Pelta.
In addition, he says that he is not trying to make himself the base of opponents.
In the past, he had already stated that he could submit his cooperation with the Indrian Paradise, which he valued for legal education; he was fully aware that his candidate had to become his first Vice-President.
For a long time he didn't attack Thomas Paclic, who was constantly critical of Pelt.
"He's been on football for more than a year and has achieved some success."
"In any case, his attacks were minor, and many people were surprised by his pre-election campaign."
"And that's why some of them are now questioning his true identity," said Pelta about his competitor.
He considered the knowledge of football to be his main weapon, from the lowest level to the national collection.
The National Assembly must represent all football.
“I would also try to stop all incidents that have been caused by Muslims or the consequences of the previous year’s corruption scandal.”
"Soon after that, I would focus on negotiations with both private and public sectors in order to guarantee sufficient amounts of money for all football," the year-old candidate ČTK said two months ago.
He then promised that his election as head of the football team would not withdraw staff.
“I will need to know the official instructions of certain staff.” This was his letter to Strawov, where the duration of the term of office was a source of understanding of nervousness.
Despite the current disaster scenarios of the planned general assembly, he believed that the four delegations would not arrive in Nimburg without delay.
"If the only argument is how to make a third round of elections, we can deal with it."
“Football needs the trust he can get, only to choose the end of his leader,” says Pelta, who remains an optimist for two days before the key day of his career.
Rachel promises that under his leadership the FAČR will work actively
If the vice-president, Vice-President of the Czech Football Association, attended the meeting on Thursday, many people in the Association will not be pleased.
Rachel promises that if she is chosen, she will have a hard time working.
He wished to make changes to the system and to make members of the Executive Committee responsible for certain areas of football.
He also promised to address the problem of bohemers; to improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; to attract more money to football; and to continue the work of former President Ivan Gashek.
"As President, I would like to focus on football in general."
“From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national collection, professional football and football activities for young people.”
"So I don't want to say what I'm doing by myself," Rachel said in her interview for the ČTK.
"I am a team player, and I would like to delegate powers to the Executive Committee so that each member focuses on the specific area."
"I'm going to give a thorough distribution of the tasks, so that in each of these segments the football will take a great step forward."
"This will probably not please many people because it will mean hard work, not just criticism of others," he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement is likely to cause him to doubt his candidate.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if there's any sense in this; and that I won't be surrounded by people who put sticks in my wheels and who suspect my every step," he explained his doubts.
"However, many people told me that I shouldn't give up, otherwise others would come."
"It's a trust I can't erase," he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gaza.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to interrupt all of this."
"There have been processes that can produce results within a few years, and I do not want someone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelt, would be elected, the situation in the Association could go back to what had been before Gaza.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's what almost competent Mirek Pelt is."
"He's surrounded by people who would do football so that it's only available for the elected."
"I can be accused of a lot of guilt, but I am no longer subjective."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football available to everyone, because then it will be a good time, not just a chosen minority," said Rachel.
Moreover, he accused him of being only President Chehii.
"While many people are trying to approve back, I'm planning to make the maximum for Moravia."
“For example, time has come to think about the division of the second lion into the Czech and Morah parts, which the winners will continue to fight in the first league.”
"This will prevent the current situation when there are only three Navy teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," Rachel said.
While in the presidential struggle, the manager of the Plyzny Thomas Paclik Club, Rachel is not ashamed to assess his chances of winning.
"However, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as my Vice-President, and I can see that I have achieved some obvious achievements," Rachel said, and for its success it concerns the economy of tens of millions of dollars on unencumbered contracts, contracts with television and lottery law negotiations.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the lack of unity in the association.
Acknowledging that Pelta was “out of the process of returning credit to Czech football”, he considered another opponent, Paclica, a strong candidate with what to offer.
"No one can doubt that he worked very well in the plaza this year."
"If you choose him, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gashek began without significant changes in the committees."
"He wouldn't be able to tell the facts for his benefit," Rachel said about his opponent.

Without one thing, Iris Meder was unable to travel during his research trips last midnight: without his shopping suit.
lying on the back of the water, she looked up on the tasteful dunes, walked up to the marble heroes waiting for her at the end of the pool, and loved carefully restored swimming pools in ar-new style.
She was trying to add every desired base to her block, with important details about the building and the history of the building.
The architect Meder looked at more than 200 swimming pools, and now printed in his recently published book Badefreuden (The Great of the Buying), all from public pools in Munich to historical shopping halls in the Black Forest and the "functional concrete buildings" in Tunisia.
Its “traveling in the most unusual purchases in Central Europe” was carried out by 13 countries. In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it visited the buyers in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is the current enthusiasm for the culture.
She's trying very little enthusiasm about sports, says Meder, but she's still in the water.
The only lack is that the mariners should be at peace with the blues of the coffee table and the smell of the chlorine, while the refugees can learn to swim in the fragrant forest or hear the happy birds in the park.
"Sometimes I asked myself why the swimming pools should always be so terrible," says a living in Vienna Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful bass. "
When the surface doubles the architecture
Swimming in the pool and in search of oil in the living room is such a health factor in the bathrooms that, according to Meder, all feelings are stimulated.
And the swimming pools can be a real pleasure for the eyes if the builders take this job. "In place of sex in the pool, you have a surface of water."
"The surface is very bright, but also reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is visible: high tides, blue plate and trampling.
The illustrated edition of the 190-page edition of the “Purchase of Shopping” contains valuable information on the architectural and cultural history of health problems - and encourages you to get into the water.
Meder's water collector discovered several outstanding specimens during a study in Hungary.
She discovered rich nitrates of water in the gas tank (Peteral Tower in Miskolt-Tapolce) and a thermal bath filled with glass water in a building built in the form of a bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Yasberne), as well as large therapeutic baths such as 100-year-old Sezene in Budapest.
Many of the popular open pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, are open with a stunning view. You can see all the Curis from the bathroom on the roof or look at the snowcapped Arlberg from the open pool in Sanct-Anton. There is a window in the park that allows you to see what is happening on the beach.
Maybe the most unusual design awaits buyers in Langenfield, and the water-cool in Ectal looks like an NLO, just landable in the Alps.
The winter is a pair of three open raccoons, which are said to be very small on the bottom of the Ectal Mountains.
Alhambra in Schwarzwalde
Meder's pool collector didn't meet the smell of chlorine in each pool.
Many thermal baths are full of cheese, and the names of Arpad in Becketschabe are so strong that you may find it hard to believe that you are in a healthy source.
The water is hydrocarbons in the glass water. The water is almost black from the hole, which reaches the skin as soon as you get into the pool - a health experience of a particular type.
Iris Meder, however, was disappointed at a certain point in his search for beautiful shopping places, and when she was trying to visit the open base of the Czech baths in Lugačovica, she found that the territory was painted.
Cobalts designed by the architect Spirit Yurkovic in 1902 were closed.
When Meder looked at the appearances of a green-white-jealed building in the style of ar-new, she saw the roses that grew between the cable plates.
One of the places where the destruction has been halted by the hot lead was the amazing swimming pool in Schwarzwald - Thermal Water Gate in Bad-Wildbad.
The Bassets have already passed through three stages of construction. You will discover not only the non-Roman elements of the post-construction period in 1844, but also the Mauritian Hall in Alhambra, which was added about 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Terminal Court was the beloved base of the Airs Meder Base not only because it was born in Schwarzvald.
"This achievement is so masterful to combine these different architecture styles," says Meder.
To enter a thermal base in such a courtyard is obviously a secondary occupation.
Speculation of agricultural production
Douche Bank is investigating the trade in agricultural products.
Christian Tivs
Will Doache Bank stop selling agricultural products?
According to SPIEBEL Online, Joseph Akkermann commissioned the Working Group to investigate the impact of speculation on the poor in the world.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg
The situation for German citizens is clear, according to one study, 84 per cent of Germans consider it unacceptable that banks are speculating on agricultural products such as wheat and maize.
Two thirds of the respondents demanded that Douche Bank and other banks stop the trade in agricultural products, as trade increases the problems facing the poorest people worldwide.
The findings were made in a study conducted by the Institute for Social Studies and Statistical Analysis of Forsa by the organization of Foodwatch users.
The study is based on a report submitted by Footwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Garald Shuman, shows that the world market rates increase prices - and banks, thus contributing to global hunger.
The consumer protection campaign is directed directly against the head of Douche Bank Joseph Akkermann, although large banking houses, such as Goodman Sacks and Morgan Stanley, are being traded.
The tax on goods was thought to be a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any case, most experts now agree that the games have rejected the rules of proposal and demand - and are based on the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Akkermann responded to the criticism and promised to investigate the charges and stated that no trade "should not endanger the good reputation of Doich Bank".
According to SPIEBEL Online, the international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year when the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of Douche Bank with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes that follow the investigation at the end of January.
The trade in goods can be reduced or stopped altogether.
Ackerman works on his image.
President Footwatch Tilo Bode made a note of the news, stressing his critical attitude to the financial sector. "Students on growing food prices are a bitter example of how unwise banks are currently acting against common interests."
As the bank's main lobbyist in Akkermann has a certain responsibility, the Lord thinks.
"The House of Bank must remove from the portfolio all investment that makes cash at food prices," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter whether it's about the starving people or the Douche Bank's reputation."
The bitter reaction of Akkerman began to surprise him, but the Director would like to have an improbable image for a few months before his stay in the office.
Mother Bank announced on Monday that the President would not go to the Supervisory Board as planned.
Cancellation of the emerging speculation on the food market could improve its image.
He also has no need to be concerned about the costs - with the consequences of his predecessor's case.
Each second would refuse to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
More than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization's campaign today.
The study was published on Tuesday, and the study was conducted for the Institute of Social Studies and Statistical Analysis for Forsa 7 and 8 November, and 1001 persons participated.
Not more than 10 per cent believe that investments at food prices are acceptable to Douche Bank.
Many bank clients would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank was involved in such a trade, and according to the study, each of them would withdraw the contributions that ultimately lead to the speculatory of goods.
43 per cent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 per cent would say they were thinking of closing the account and moving into another bank.
House of the 21st century in Vienna
Pavilion in New York City
Ingeborg Winsovski
Architectural history with the fall, fall and happy ending. Pavilion of Austria for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels was awarded awards, became a museum in Vienna, and was abandoned and destroyed.
Now it's reopened as an exhibition center.
Pavilion Austria, designed by Karl Swancerro for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a well-known example of the modern-day western architecture with its simple forms, glass-rolled halls, strong expressions of faith in technical progress.
Pavilion Schwanzer fought Gran-pri on the architecture in 1958 for his easy-to-be construction of steel and steel.
The building is considered to be expensive in the modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built Austrian pavilions at the next World Exhibition.
Finally, in 1973, he celebrated his legendary four - inch - long - foot - long [4 cm] BMW and her sister - in - law - in - tea building.
Pavilion, thought to be a temporary exhibition building, was transferred to the Swiss garden around the southern corner of Vienna, transformed and opened as the 20th century Museum in 1962 - often referred to as the 20th century House.
In any case, the building was not suitable for the museum on technical and spatial considerations - there was no building in which art could be built and the bad air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna gained a new home.
The house had been abandoned since 2001, and it had become worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Krishnitz has so far restored the pavilion, which was called the House of the 21st Century, and will be used as a museum of modern art.
This museum is the Belveder Museum office, which opens the first exhibition on Tuesday evening, in all respects a happy event.
Agnes Hussleyn-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belveder Gallery in 2007, contributed to the new start.
Husslayn-Arco, a graduate of the history of art-based careers in youth who worked at Sotheby's Museum, Guggenheim and thus became the founder and director of the Contemporary Museum in Salzburg, convinced politicians and consumers to continue to build, attracted public funds and private donations and decided how to use the building.
The new museum had to include a permanent exhibition of the Frizza Internet, coffee and bookstore together with modern art, and an office building had to be built.
Strong control & limited budget
The crystal was then the ideal candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, by the restoration and expansion of the Vienna section of Joseph Olbrich, and won the competition, but he also learned from Swanzer at the University of Vienna technology, and the Pavilion was “a very important place” for him, where he visited the exhibitions “at least every week”.
He knew the original design and the tasks ahead of the building, the building that had already lost part of its size and ease when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems encountered during the last refurbishment were much more serious, and the idea was "a power-swifter," says Kristianitz.
Fire profiles in the glass phase have been replaced, reinforced with a glass safety glass, and the glass surface has been replaced with a high-speed safety glass.
The permanent translations of the heat bridge were strengthened or replaced, and the materials were removed from the pipes.
Two lower stages created space for the new use of the building, with a light bridge between the building and the street providing light - virtually a new building, but still a beautiful Swannzeville.
The original outer doors were kept and the building was decorated with an old red-green colour of corrosion protection.
Hall's movie theater just like it used to be.
All of this is under strict control of the museum administration and with a limited budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, expensive and approved by the museum administration," Kristianitz says, pointing to the level of ground flooring.
The building remained flexible and easy, despite restrictions, problems and changes.
The Christian observed recently that the "Brussels" pavilion was a rough, typical story of the "Capils in the City".
Such a architecture "not always in its place" and nevertheless wants to "encourage this awareness".
The 21st century house is in a very good place, as there was an unexpected success in the planning of the city.
A second happy event may occur. The second building of the 21st century is the second building of the Christian Church, the collection of the French Foundation of Gabsburg, which has acquired the Temporary Exhibition Hall of Berlin and is reported to be in negotiations with the city on its location next to the Swiss garden.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a multimillion winter anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn has developed an anti-crisis plan to avoid the decline of winter voyages.
The number of staff should be increased twice.
The cost is millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year to avoid winter vacations and delays.
With reference to the internal anti-crisis plan Deutsche Bahn, Bill reports that investments totalling around 300 million euros were planned by 2015.
Investments are aimed at improving the performance of the local motor and rail networks even under extreme conditions.
The number of private and attractive staff involved in snow-drifting and platforming will be doubled to 16,000.
The aim is to clean snow and ice platforms up to the start of work and 90 per cent of the necessary shots within four to five hours.
Rudiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of cancelling and delayed travel to the summer to meet with government and industry leaders two months ago.
The past winter Deutsche Bahn experienced significant difficulties with passenger transport because it did not catch the reserves at the moment of deterioration of the conditions.
Many of the new regional trips were expected to be approved by the Federal Railway Service.
There were also some delays in ICE travel.
Deutsche Bahn also had a lot of time to check ICE's axles for many years after one of the ICE's voyages broke here on the main line in Kelne.
The Bank will pay a lot of millions of dollars in the United States.
New inconveniences followed the riots around Joseph Akkermann, Director General Douche Bank: Douche Bank is putting a fine in the United States in millions of pounds of sterlings.
There was little problem with the family, the former industrial giant in the United States now forced him. The Douche Bank with the headquarters in Frankfurt will pay $145 million (106 million) to settle disputes that arose after the bankruptcy of five major credit unions during the financial crisis.
The problem arose in the area of sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Board of Credit Unions (NCUA), the Financial Market Regulator, blames a number of major banks for using false promises to lure credit unions into buying their financial products.
The value of the bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and fell below the credit unions.
"We are pleased that they have solved this problem without addressing the parties to the court," said the representative of Douche Bank in New York.
The bank did not recognize its guilt in the agreement.
The same is true of the Citigroup, which agreed to pay $20.5 million.
President NCUA Debbi Matz welcomed the operational response of both banks.
The National Credit Unions Management (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. Credit Unions and is involved in banking processes to protect consumers ' contributions.
NCUA is fighting for the compensation of losses that are selected from billions of dollars.
It's the first such agreement.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and encouraged the case against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Suspect mortgage bonds are so-called securities secured by mortgage loans.
They are supported by internal loans.
This led to the trial of a number of financial companies, when in 2007 the real estate market in the United States collapsed.
The American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers ordered long lives in September 2008 in the financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still fighting a storm.
Investors and regulators have raised a large number of claims, demanding compensation or punishment for mussels.
The Federal Housing Funding Agency (FHFA) is the largest bidder.
It accuses 18 major international banks of having obtained deposit agreements with American credit organizations Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac about $200 billion.
The Bank's daughter is also at risk of a trial by FHFA for numerous agreements of a total value of $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires a bank with a headquarters in Frankfurt to take responsibility for the "substantial losses" but has not yet indicated the exact amount.
The Bank rejected claims as unfounded and reported its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffet invests 10 billion in IBM
Buffet's financial guarantor is actively investing in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares of more than $10 billion.
Meanwhile, the largest American investor, Warren Buffet, has always claimed that he does not invest in computer and IT companies because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, the annual report of IBM changed its view on investments in this industry.
According to Buffet, he had to understand earlier that IBM was primarily offering services and purchasing computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, the investment of Warren Buffet has been considered a risky move.
IBM, a veteran IT adult, has now received the title "Ser IBM".
In an interview with the U.S. Business Telephony, CNBC Buffet reported that from March it had received IBM shares totalling $10.7 billion.
Its investment holding Berkshire Hataway has become one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffet said that even IBM had not known anything about his involvement before.
He commended the management that was able to achieve even in the face of the financial crisis.
"They've done a lot of work," said Buffet, under the management strategy.
A significant time IBM focused on high-income IT services such as data centres.
The founder of the computer industry, which has been offering software and advisory services for more than 100 years, as well as powerful business computers.
Buffet's been avoiding technology companies.
He claimed that he only invested in the company he understood business.
and invested, for example, in freight transport, in the production of raw materials and in machinery.
Its holding Berkshire Hataway has shares in the long list of major companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (former Municher Rück), along with some 80 of its own subsidiaries.
An 81-year-old acquires a small textile company, Berkshire Hataway in the 1960s, and with the help of skilled investment, is one of the most expensive companies in the world.
His image of life, however, remained humble,
Made it a cultural figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost innocent instinct in the matter of money brought him the name Oracula from Omahi.
The share price of IBM increased by 1 per cent until market opening after Buffet's investment announcement.
The Global Giant, also known as IBM, is worth more than $220 billion in the fund exchange, making it one of the most expensive high-tech companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffet, however, said it was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Her founder, Bill Gates, is his close friend.
Immortal danger
Following the discovery of the Turkish media in Zwickau, Turkish media began to question the authority of the law in Germany.
One of the newspapers speaks of the "blood ideology" that is now being resurfaced on the surface.
The killing of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 was the result of an extremist ideology.
Fear and anxiety have been a response to this communication in Turkey and in the German-Turkey community.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has led to a long - forgotten fear of life, such attacks on Turks have not occurred since their arrival in Melne in November 1992 and Zolingen in May 1993.
There has never been any doubt, but Xenophobics exist in Germany.
However, the law-extreme network has now been discovered to a degree that has not yet been fully recognized.
“Birthing of Blood Ideology?” was the title of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret informant of the secret services, and expresses concern that the German authorities could be subjected to a terrorist attack.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) responded peacefully by replacing the victims of racial hatred with a silent pictogram against the Brandenburg gate in these exits.
Two weeks ago, the Turkish Berlin community at the ceremony with the participation of German and Turkish politicians noted the fifteenth anniversary of the German-Turkey bilateral agreement on the employment of the labour force.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a history of success.
The release in some Turkish media was like a tribute. A gift from Germany to the fifteenth anniversary is one of the articles on the Turkish Haber X portal, which comment on the murder series.
The German edition of Hürriyet also did not allow this parallel to be carried out.
"It's getting worse." That's the name of the column of Ahmet Kullage.
He noted that the deaths of people who paid taxes and their work had made a significant contribution to the conversion of Germany.
The conduct of the police and the subsequent successful vessel has been critical of the German-Turkey Internet forums.
The authors were asked why the German authorities had not previously considered following suspects in the rights of extremists.
Some of the authors have come to a very low level of rhetoric. "If they continue to act the same way, migrants will have no choice except armed self-defense."
"It's gonna be the best self-defense."
"The peace in Germany is very much dependent on how the whole network will be opened up and the justice of punishment," says Helen.
The crimes in Melne and Zolingen in the 1990s were examples of the threat of the peace in Germany.
The photo of the frozen ruins in Zollingen was deeply impressed with the memory of the Germans and Turks.
No other event has shown to the Turks so clearly that they are at risk, and to the Germans, that the unbelievers and the equals can be turned into real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the feeling of unity of Turkey.
Do not repeat past errors
The Turkish press in that period mainly condemned the failure of the German police after the attacks, and Helmut Kul refused to visit the survivors in Melne.
He sent a telegram of reconciliation to the President of Turkey after his ascension to Zulingen, but his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel-Kinkel took part in the memorial ceremony in Kelne, in his view, taking into account the taxes the Turks pay in Germany,
He has determined the value of human beings for the taxes it pays.
The current disclosure in Turkish media has once again shown how the distrust of many German Turks has deepened to the present German State.
It was clear that it was now necessary to do so in addition to efforts to identify and reassess the rights-extreme terrorist organizations in Germany.
Bank scandal in the Turkish Asser
Most of Europe's leading risk policies are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
The U.S. has not just been involved in the financial crisis, and it has been fighting one, the other, ever since.
Now it's German to bring it back to the course.
Alex Weber didn't suspect his role.
In July, following its effective treatment from the head post of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 it would begin its work at least as the President of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss Bank in the U.S. and an unexpected and profitable career.
Alex Weber was clear in the afternoon, commended Switzerland for its beauty, for its renewed strength, and made several friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
"UBS has been able to change for the better."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Phillier and Oswald Gruble."
But it became clear in September that everything would be completely different.
In London, the U.S. Trader has built a bank security system and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
The U.S. Executive Director, Oswald Grubel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the President of the Board of Directors of the U.S. Board of Directors has felt sick, and everyone wants to know, when will Alex Weber finally enter his post?
Weber should consult the Bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, he will take the position of the President of the Council in May, not in 2013.
This will not be easy for Alex Weber.
He is a professor of economics and a central bank specialist, not a traditional banker, and he will certainly need time to adapt.
He was also responsible for the bank's strategy, which proved that he had long deserved the name "the biggest bank scandal in Europe".
On the one hand, the U.S. is a very big, long-term, he has managed the world's biggest assets, but on the other hand, he's not out of the scandals for years.
Looks like a proud Swiss bank won't lose anything.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the U.S.A. had a wonderful reputation.
The Bank has combined the image of a secret and sustainable but at the same time, the asset manager with ambitious objectives and the desire to become the largest player in the investment bank.
As a result, in 2007, the WFP managed 1.6 billion, thus managing more tangible customers than any other bank in the world,
As an investment bank, he joined the largest banks of the world.
That's what impressed me.
Hans Geiger, an ex-banker and professor of banking, who had been teaching at the Institute of Bank Affairs of the University of Zurich, explains: "I have always led my students to the U.S. as a model of a good bank."
"I know what we know now, you can ask how I could be so wrong."
He's really wrong.
Only in 2007 it became clear that something in the U.S. is going wrong.
In the middle of the year, Executive Director Peter Wuffley, who was considered to be an intellectual and, at the same time, a shining banker, suddenly left his post.
A few months later, we were able to imagine why he had gone.
The Bank's investment unit was trying to play the standard prize books and had to write billions.
Believe me, you don't, but the U.S. has reported an increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to fight the crisis.
The Bank has indeed been able to find investors - but investors from whom many banks would have recently declined - one very undisputed Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund, hidden so that its name was not even reported.
It was just the first shot.
In April 2008, the situation was much worse.
The Bank had to report new billions of losses, and the President of the Board of Directors of Marcel Ospel, second on the level of payments, the President of the Board of Directors in Switzerland, withdrew in 2006.
A disaster occurred in October 2008 and the State had to save it because of the lack of investment during the financial crisis.
The National Bank has acquired the toxic value of books on an unnamed number of billions, and the Swiss Confederation has paid six billion Swiss francs for a conversion obligation to become the owner of a bank.
All Switzerland was shocked: the country was aware of the dramatic consequences of large banks in the small country.
Finally, the 2007 GNI balance was five times the total production of Switzerland (see chart).
"We can't save the U.S. again," says bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred shortly after the first one.
A few months later, the U.S. had capitalized in a tax dispute with the United States, and he said he was willing to pass on the data to contingent customers who, with the help of the bank, might have been exempt from taxes.
The UF has also agreed to pay $780 million, resulting from the return of unreasonably income from business in addition to taxes.
The UF thus acknowledged that it was an instrument for the removal of taxes.
At the same time, the U.S. has lost what has always been his advantage in combating rich customers, a secret undertaking.
After that, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and Chairman of the Board of Directors subsequently withdrew, and
The client's money started.
Within a few months, the bank lost confidence in both the main areas of its activities, in investment due to poor speculation and in asset management, as a result of assistance and promotion of tax removal.
And it just calmed down and it was said that the U.S. was able to overcome the situation like this accident with an apricot-traitor, and the sole contractor dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
It is clear that risk management in the investment department is not working.
"The incident with Adobe has clearly shown that risk control has not changed enough," says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks is also convinced: "The UF problem is that he does not have a risk control tool".
The long-term vigilance of Swiss banks by the holders of the largest assets of the world is not an excessive risk, but a security for money, whether the peace has been destroyed outside the Albanian Republic or not.
The Swiss banks have become a symbol of undisputed trust, as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize the sweet taste in chocolate.
The U.S. headquarters in Zurich is still in line with the image of a worthy Swiss private bank, just a little more.
It's just a classic.
The main bank office is located in Zurich, Bankhofstrasse, which leads from the main point of reference to the Turkish island, in the north-west corner of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are growing here, and the rent rates for shops are one of the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss stores of the Confectionery Sprüngli type can be found here on Christmas grounds such as Tiffany's.
The Swiss banks have been here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the Credi Suiss Court and elite private banks, such as Julius Ber.
The heavy door leads to the U.S. bridge.
There's a big red sofa standing around the walls, with a big sign of the Seif.
The U.S. knows what his clients need is trust.
But both the largest Swiss banks, the U.S. and the Credit Suisse, have at some point rejected Swiss banking concepts - or, as one of the few Swiss banks thinks, gave them.
He wouldn't want to see his name in the newspaper - like all Swiss banks, he's also working with two major banks.
He thinks the U.S. has become too big, especially in the investment bank, where the English are very active.
He thinks the Swiss can add something here.
"And if that's what it means, they've been adapting to English customs for a long time."
In fact, the Anglo-Saxon Investment Bank has changed the U.S., bringing it the first big profits - and then the Fisco. No other financial institution in Europe has lost as much money as the Swiss largest bank in the jungle.
Catastrophe became evident on 15 October 2008.
"In the midst of this, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million people has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of the country," writes Lucas Hessig in his book Chrmey.
Policies have approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save a bank from bankruptcy.
How could that be?
If asked by Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is mainly of the size of the U.S.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks were united into one large group in June 1998.
A bank was formed, which was already too big for little Switzerland, and a bank that continued to grow.
This also helped to complement the two banks that formed the U.S., one was a wealthy but a moderate bank specialized in the management of assets in Zurich; the other was not such a rich but much more internationalized.
Internationalised investment banks immediately gained access to a large amount of money that they could use to steal the most powerful wheel.
Two names are related to GDP growth: Peter Wolffly, Executive Director of the U.S. Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, President of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wolffly and Ospel were a dream team," says bank analyst Hans Geiger.
"Wulffly, an intelligent, humble and very intelligent model and statistics, and Ospel with his internal instinct, the past all the way up from the stage to the bank."
But Ospell was finally on Wolffly.
And Wolffly could make a critical mistake. "He decided his models were real," says Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride leads to disappointment.
The U.S. officials will well remember the meetings of government members at which Wolffly has always repeated the same losung - to attract Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he led a tour desk where bank success had been achieved.
The U.S. wanted to fall to the top of the table.
He was able to make part of this path.
The U.S. was the most important player in the trade in currency and government valuables.
The competent management consultants, however, pointed to a weak spot, which in banking terms is called "permanent income", which was far behind the largest banks.
The U.S.
To stop the virus, U.S.A. was involved in an accident that had barely survived.
As they grew up, the bank itself and its hedge fund invested in the US standard securities.
This has been developed in a large mechanism that has combined valuable books based on American mortgages and sold them further and further by continuing to bear the risks.
Even when other banks had long sought a way out of this process, the U.S. continued.
"UBS bought a lot by summer 2007 when the American real estate market was already in fire," says bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One manager had to deal with the way the bank attempts were made more difficult than it had been said at the beginning.
Posts in the U.S. have become child games and are still hopeless.
Any one who is leading this huge bank is almost impossible.
It must find a strategy for the bank that has returned behind all existing business models.
The Hague bank analysis already has the idea of turning away from the investment bank, focusing on asset management and forgetting its Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not ready to go that far.
However, it is evident that investment activities need to be substantially completed.
The new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, plans to present its future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swedish banker was considered in fact only as a temporary decision when the bank suddenly withdrew from its predecessor, Grubel.
In the past, he has been able to demonstrate the character and now, as stated by the Turkish bank on Tuesday, is headed by the U.S.A. on a permanent basis.
Ernotti plans to return the investment bank to the state in which it was in the mid-90s.
He's down 3500 jobs.
But that's not gonna be enough.
The U.S. needs a development concept.
What's the U.S.?
How does he plan on making money?
These questions are probably the subject of Axel Weber.
He had just said that he and his wife were looking for a room in Zurich.

Fears of recession in Europe are under the U.S. fund bureau
The current recession in Europe has deteriorated the US investors' mood at the beginning of the week.
The change of governments in Athens and Rome had little effect.
The share of industrial production on the continent has undermined the hope that a debt crisis can be overcome in the future.
The general relief from the changes of the Governments in Rome and Athens was not supported.
The euro fell in relation to the dollar.
Last week the Italian and Greek stanzas were still considered half full, not half empty - but now the problems are again on the first floor, Mark Lucini from Janney Mongomery Scott said.
The financial bureaux, in particular, were on sales lists.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index was closed at level 12,078 with a decrease of 0.6 per cent.
The market barometer in trade was between 12,027 and 12,170 points.

Industry in 17 countries has significantly reduced production and adjusted to the end of growth.
The Eurostat Statistical Service reported that in September companies produced two per cent less than last month.
This message put American investors in scepsis. "We're not on the island, we're dependent on them," said Steve Goldman from Goldman Management.
He also stated that Europe would not be able to speed up the recession and that banks would show further signs of weakness.
The legendary investor Warren Buffet was able only to confirm these fears, and in the interview with CNBC, he said that it is still uncertain whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis.
He therefore considers that it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffet had been excommunicated in a monsoon corsion for less than a decade and invested in the US high-tech industry.
Its investment in IBM of more than $10 billion has raised the value of the company's shares in trade almost one per cent against the trend.

Mindful Wounds Fill the City
The game is considered a problem bird in many places, and experts say today that these very smart birds will no longer be able to escape from the city.
Some people like birds, others want to get rid of them as soon as possible, and they've been part of the city's landscape for centuries, but people who complain about noise and noise are growing in many parts of the population.
The solution to the bird problem, however, has not yet been reached.
At the first symposium on wars, experts in the city of Ler, East Africa, claimed that players could no longer be expelled from the city.
Experts from all Germany discussed possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Conservatives claimed that the root of the problem in cities was in migration of particularly protected players, indicating that the use of chemicals in agriculture has increased the destruction of traditional habitats.
Ohota, which expanded the construction and extraction of traditional wood cuts, made life difficult for birds.
The walls are protected.
In the town of Zest in Westphalia and in the north-west of Jevre, Dipholce, Ahime under Bremen and Lere there are large colonies of more than 600 parent couples.
A series of fires in Lere caused infamous newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described the hunting of birds in the wild and killing their wings as particularly cruel.
The architect and Landshaft designer Werner Clever from Lera said:
The flow of water or wood wells has often had adverse effects, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lara, Baden-Wurtemberg.
"The animals are scattered, and large colonies are made and distributed to other areas."
The threat may be limited to the exclusion of a number of hospitals, elderly homes and schools.
"We'll have to live with them, get rid of them, not the option."
There will be no solution to the problem in urban areas, says Mr. Lera Wolfgang Keller.
The combination of the threat of birds from the need to protect and encourage them to return to other areas could be an exit.
The information booths instead of benzopil was a losung proposed by the psychologist and ethnologist Utua Maria Jurgens, who is a perfectly different approach to birds. "We must be confident to live with this problem."
Jurgens was one of the founders of the educational opposition route in Asherberge in Schlezwig-Golstein, where there is information on the lives of very thoughtful players at the information stations.
The project is already in the interest of tourists.
Jurgens also expressed his opinion on the complaints of noise produced by birds. "The noise gives a lot of information, and they have to tell each other a lot."
The ants and the spiders of these birds come into the legend, and they often use not only tools to control what they look like, but they also make weapons themselves.
The students of behavior at Cambridge University recently protested the importance of bird intelligence on four players.
In one experiment, birds quickly realized that they had to pay for a fee to get a man to pray.
Without special training, they knew the size and shape of the stone needed to cut the load.
In another experiment, matching players had to face a more complex challenge.
The researchers placed a small glass with a individual prayer in a vertical cylinder.
Birds couldn't get the key.
But the investigators gave them chicken beans.
All four birds were used to make hooks and use hooks to cut the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four players have already dealt with this with the first attempt.

Mass killings - human measurement
An impressive and very good new book, Peter England, entitled "The Beauty and Sculpture: The Personal History of World War I", begins with a long list of people who have lost their hearts.
Here is the advice to read: Watch this page carefully and use it as a bookmark.
You will meet these people very close to Mr. England, and this list of people who are active will be your GPS, your mother at the moment when one of these men and women is on the way and you will be lost in the war.
Mr. England is a Swedish historian and journalist.
It is also a new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which is being awarded by the Nobel laureate.
The book he wrote right now - unusual, he describes it, exactly as "anti-historic work".
It has few names, important treaties or outstanding battles; there is almost no business, hunting journalists or discussion of tactics and fighting techniques.
It's not just a book about what happened, it explains how much "book about what it looked like" it's about "feels, impressions, experiences and the state of mind".
The book “Crassus and Skull” shared the experience of war years with more or less remarkable men and women, from both sides of the front line, from schools and botanists to Albanians, doctors, early assistants and staff.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone falls into a plane, loses his hand or his leg, comes with a mind or death.
Their lives here are like church candles: new ones are added to a multitude of others, and some are burned at that time.
The book, Mr. England, is a reflection of the standard of historical books.
This is also an amendment to the assumption that the First World War was only a heavy war on the Western front.
"Crassus and scarf" is a gift to the panorama of other military theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
In this book are yellow oil for soldiers; one of them meets the birthplaces in Egypt under pyramids; the unsolved problem is the black thread.
It's an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
The war is covering the lives of these people as a natural disaster, such as Hurricane Katrina, which is a devastating blow.
When the consonant is soon heard, and you're a woman and you're home with the children, will you stay in the place or run away?
Or who else is it?
Almost no one understands what is happening and why we have to fight in this war.
"The lack of facts," said Mr. Englond, "is filled with ideas, assumptions, hopes, fears, continuances, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and sounds."
"Grace and shame" pursues the fate of such people as Florence Farmboro, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young seaman of the German fleet of open sea.
Their stories are taken mainly from memorabilia, letters, and other material already published.
The stories of their lives may be frightening or captivating, but they are, above all, alive thanks to the small moments and details collected by Mr. Englond.
And many of them are blind and deaf.
Speaking of the history of the German school, he says, "Erasz, go to the school."
"The replacement coffee, the distribution of aluminium, the current resin, the storage connections, the wood-drinks."
He's still talking about scaffolding in Germany.
He describes “the flesh of the pressed grain mixed with the fat (and the refined falsified bone made of wood); the tobacco made of dried roots and dried potatoes; the knife, by the wood. ”
He noted that there were “837 registered meat substitutes authorised for the production of potatoes and 511 registered coffee substitutes”.
Some stories are about honor and honor.
One American states in his mind that it is very difficult to do evil and says about the war: "You feel that, at the end of the day, this is why men were created, not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskeys, dinner paper or baseball, and to claim that this shows and there is civilization, and under your decorated dress there is no barrier."
The British soldier, on the other hand, notes that he will almost die and no one will notice and grieve.
"When a person humbles himself with the thought of self-sustainment, he would like to think that this will happen before the public," he writes.
But it's the opposite, it's awfully like "a convicted person who's secretly engaged."
Other comments concern old Europe, which is disintegrated and new forms of fear.
"The conflict has become more and more economical," says Mr. England, "war agencies."
He noted the arrival of a man who called “a new species in the beginning of the century: a beautiful expressive and ideologically trusted mass killer in a good dry suit, which cuts a sharp seat on a written table”.
People act in unexpected ways: low-performance, as much as heroism.
Mr. Englond spoke of soldiers who were all trying to escape from prostitution in order to avoid service on the front.
"The very gross expression of this can be seen in the trade of a genocidal hate, which soldiers purchased and sold to themselves by genitals in hopes of falling to the hospital," he writes.
"All the despairs of his eyes had caught him, which often brought him to a living blind."
Mr. England, translated with Swedish Peter Gravez, was a mild but gentle, fine fit for his humanitarian mission.
In ten small scenes, it shows how the war "freed completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders stop fighting them.
The best books on World War I were often incorrect, such as “Great War and Modern Memory” by Paul Fasselle or by Romans such as “In the West Front without Change” by Erik-Marie Remarca, not by exaggerating historical work.
Mr. England's book is in this mess.
Its book has the most fascinating ending I can remember in the medical literature.
I won't tell him.
But that's what he came from the book to the page with a list of characters, got it out of your hands and into your pocket.
After the previous error, the exact estimate is
Hundreds of police officers, some in protective helmets, were involved in the operation.
Nights from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because there was to be fewer people in Zuktti Park at the time.
The operation was secreted from all but a few high-level officers, the rest said that they were being trained.
Police Commissioner Raymond U. Kelly was in the centre of the event, and his presence stressed the importance of the operation of the Department of Police.
It was also impossible to repeat such episodes over the past few weeks, such as the use of a list of gas against protesters, which was contrary to the department's rules and caused a hurricane of public sympathies to the occupying Powers.
So after two weeks of planning and training, the police operation to release the protestors from the Zuktti Park began.
The authorities were prepared to observe the development of occupations in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis studies were conducted on the island of Rendels, calculated at Zucotta.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called trainings in the event of irregularities - counter-terrorism measures that provide for the rapid transfer of a large number of police officers - with the view of the Netherlands Manhattan.
The last training took place last night on Monday at the Manhattan side of East River.
The order of entry into the park came in "the last minute" - he told the source known as the orders in which the task was only referred to as "training".
"The few bastards I know and who called the case didn't say they're going to the Zucotti Park," said the man who spoke about the anonymity.
"The only ones who knew they were going to South Park were at the highest posts in the department."
One of the reasons for the secret was a lesson that the city took.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clear the park, but they left before hundreds of protestors who had fled within the deadline to hear about these plans.
On Tuesday, police officers from various police units, including the forces from the districts, were used to control criminal districts.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost as often as they were at work, would come and leave the park during the day, doing 1 hour at the right time for arrival.
"It was right to do this when the least people were in the park," he said.
The life-saving service machines with projectors and speakers were assembled at Peck-Slip and Franklin Rusvelt-Drive, around the Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
The projector and earlier written statements from speakers seem to have upset many protestors.
When the officials of the administrative units arrived in the park in their deep veins, many protestors simply picked up their belongings and left.
The police reported that the halls didn't last until 1:45 a.m., giving protestary time to collect things.
Other police groups, according to the eyewitnesses, were gathered at the perimeter to enter the case if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park stopped leaving.
Paul J. Brown, the head of the Police Department, said that this was done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see how the police were operating and that the police were treating them severely.
Mr. Brown said that cars with cameras at Church Street, along the west end of the park, could take a picture.
When the police went west through the chest of personal protestants, including bags, plastic bags and polyethylene bags, full clothes, the Sanitary Department's teams went after it, collecting what had been broken.
Some of the protesters who refused to leave, pulled their guns, and took pictures of it on the Internet soon.
The main group of protestors took positions along the corner of the kitchen camp, at the center of the park.
Some set up a baricade, and the police went inside, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the camp center dug their hands together.
And two men buried themselves in the trees, said Mr. Kelly.
In order to survive the closures, rescue personnel were summoned.
No arrests were held in the park about 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The cleaning operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police reported.
Mr. Brown said that about 142 people had been arrested in the park.
Most of them were arrested for "convention of public order and resistance to detention," he said.
The highest officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department and senior officer in the department.
Phil. T. Pulaski, head of the Swiss police department, was there too.
Mr. Kelly, although he was present, "he didn't run the operation," said Mr. Brown.
The second group of police was waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if necessary.
Constructions were placed in Cortland Street, in the north of the park, and in the Pine Street, in the south.
Observers saw how these positions expanded the perimeter even further beyond the South Pole border.
At one point, observers saw as a group of police, many with shields, further exasperated people.
About 28 people were on the north perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night took place in the south of the park.
About 5 o'clock in the south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped onto the cross of a police car, while the other, according to observers, aired out of the police station.
At some point out of the crowd, he flew out of the box of fans.
As a result, one police officer and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
Professional union of service staff at the city court of release
The trade union, representing hundreds of school staff who lost seats last month, plans to file to the city court in the middle, claiming that exemptions were not necessary and were discriminatory due to the non-proportional influence of schools where poor students were taught.
The trial is probably the latest, the available trade union of the District Council 37 attempting to abolish exemptions.
Sixty-two school assistants, co-ordinator of work with parents and other employees who were among the lowest paid workers in the city lost their place on 7 October because the leaders of the union called for a political response to their refusal to give the city access to the medical funds managed by the working groups to close the gap in the previous budget.
The city officials categorically denied the charges.
At the hearings of the City Council last month, the school Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said that the release was part of the budget they signed in June.
One of the members of the board paid, telling him that there was nowhere in the budget to indicate that the school staff would be released.
The representatives of the 37 District Council reported that they had been informed of the claims by warning the Department of Education against the request; a press conference would be held in the middle to announce the formal submission of the request to the Supreme Court of the State of Manhattan.
Mr. Walcott and the Department of City Education will be asked to respond and list eight temporary fired workers as refugees, all black or Latin American women as well as most of the assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, the representative of the City Department, said that the city had not seen a request and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to the preliminary version of the New York Times complaint, the trade union focused on a number of school dropouts in poor urban areas to support the claim for unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools lost more assistants because they were chronically underfunded.
He indicated that while there were no exemptions in Staten Island and that 17 auxiliary school staff in the Upper East Side or Trinidad schools had lost their seats in the 23rd district of Brunsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had arrived in the Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants who worked in the 36 free secondary school in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students live in poverty, the survey says: “These are not the areas of stable parents who can earn money to fill the budget gap.”
P.S. 36 budget was estimated at 3.26 per cent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the method of additional funding for each poor student attending school.
The trade union also claims that the school director may have been misled by the language of the notification allowing the coordinators to work with their parents.
The notification used the word “extreme” although the word “extreme” was more often used when the school teacher was transferred to the list of available staff paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six co-ordinators on parental work have been fired," says the blackout, "and not just translated."
Mission completed, Congress ready for the Libya Agreement
It seems that the Republicans and Democrats at the Capitol Valley are finally ready to agree on something about the resurrection in Libya.
All that had to be done was to win, old dictator Muamar Caddafi was taken to the ground and killed, and the American intervention was over.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Senate should consider the resolution issued by President John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts) along with Senators John Mackein (Republic, Arizona) and Joseph I. Liberman (independent, Connecticut), who commended the Libyans for their success and the American army for "regarding".
"The purpose of this resolution is to bring back the respect of the people of Libya when they begin their return to their country," Kerry said.
“This is a confirmation of their support for their democratic reforms by both parties.”
The language may seem harmless, but no discussion on Libya has been easy.
In this summer, both parties argued with each other and with the White House on the formulation of a series of resolutions approving or condemning the role of the American Army in NATO Mission in Libya.
In June Kerry and McKain submitted a resolution that allowed the limited use of American armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority of the two parties and did not fall to the vote in the Senate.
However, on the same day when the bill was passed by representatives in the Chamber, the Chamber also did not support a proposal that would reduce the financing of the American operation in Libya.
This left an American mission in some form of legislative purity - when Congress is slow enough to criticise Obama's approach to the mission, but not so bad, to really pick the soil out of its feet.
Thereafter, the uncertainty of the Congress was compounded by the events
In August Tripoli became a Libyan rebel, and on October 20 Cadafi was killed.
NATO Mission officially concluded on 31 October.
Now the Senate can be ready for action.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, " ashamed of the people of Libya for its incredible courage and unencumbered persistence in the quest for freedom " and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people from their inalienable courage and professionalism."
The resolution also “recognises the national interest of the United States in the successful and irrevocable transition to democracy in Libya”.
Are new measures fully supported by the Foreign Affairs Council or disbursed by legislators as the June bill?
In response to the latest version, Senator Richard G. Luger, Chairman of the Committee, made a statement.
The representative of Luger said on Monday that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other hand, the Capitol of the House of Representatives should vote this week for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, the main legislative priority for almost every Republican and some Democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by a member of the Chamber of Representatives of Bob Gudlat (Republication, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or on anything else that will be brought to the plenary vote of the Congress.
Other legislators have not been able to make their amendments to the plenary meeting, but not because they have not tried.
The Gudlata amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments affecting the wide range of issues that have been raised in this gathering.
Some have doubled - and the same bill has been introduced to the House of Representatives and to the Senate - while others have been minor variations.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendments on a balanced budget only in the Chamber of Representatives and a number of "control over federal costs".
Some of them are also identical, but they give their authors the opportunity, in particular the newly elected Republicans who want to make their own summary, to feel that they have "caused" such a proposal.
The Control Act, which passed in August, called for the House of Representatives to vote in favour of a balanced budget amendment.
In March 58, the senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some Congressmen want to limit the terms of office of members of the Congress, while members of the House of Representatives of José Serrano (Democratic, New York) want to cancel the limitation within two terms for the President.
Congressman Jessie L. Jackson-Young (Democrat, Illinois) proposed many amendments guaranteeing, in addition to the right to quality education and health.
An amendment prohibiting single marriages has been proposed for many years as well as another prohibiting flagging.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if they are opposed by two thirds of the States.
As the members of the Congress have tried to propose amendments, they are moving not faster than they have been in the past years.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 such amendments, while at the 110th it introduced 66.
This will take place in comparison with the early 1990s when members of the Congress, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they did not succeed more than they are now.
The last amendment adopted - 27 - was approved in 1992 but was introduced to Congress in 1789.
"A death, but not a victory," said Giffords in his first television interview after he tried.
Ten months after the armed man shot into it at a public event in Tusone, a member of the Chamber of Representatives of Gabriel Giffords (Democratic Party, Arizona) appeared on the federal channel on Monday evening, a young man from the boat show "Sunce will be back tomorrow" and said he would like to welcome more than to return to Congress.
On the "20/20" programme, E-Bi-Si-News and Diane Soier, Giffords worked hard to formulate proposals and needed assistance on the way.
The program showed her a hard way to recover after the trauma caused by a stroke that broke the skull and broke the left side of the brain from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she unexpectedly returned to the House of Representatives and three times announced on the draft law on the limit of debt.
In his first television interview after the January strike, where six and 13 people were killed, Giffords smiled, laughed and kissed, and called his recovery “hard”.
In Soyer's case, 41-year-old Giffords said, "That's good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronomer Mark Kelly, was part of the time special release "20/20", which showed the intention of launching a new book entitled "Gabbi: The History of Manhood and Hope".
After the shooting on 8 January, the speaker told of the return of Giffords.
On the video taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she's sitting on a hospital bed with a british head and long neck.
She can only lift one or two fingers at her husband's request.
A few months later, we'll see how Giffords sits in the chair, and the physicists teach her how to perform simple actions.
Break your head.
Remove the jacks.
And then her first word, "What."
A few days later, Giffords made a second word - "toss", please change the menu tomorrow.
The video shown by Ebi-si shows that music played a central role in the healing of Giffords: We see how the congressman sings along with the doctors "The Girls just want to enjoy" Cindy Lopper and "The Free Fall" Tom Petty.
In an interview with Soyer Giffords, who spent two hours a day in the procedure, said he would not remember the day of trial.
Her husband told her that he read the Giffords article in the March 12 shooting newspaper when she stopped him for the first time to ask about the six who were killed then.
The suspect, George Lee Lafner, is in Missouri prison and is forced to be treated in waiting court.
"Many people have died," said Giffords Soyer.
"Tile, heavy, heavy."
Once during her recovery, Kelly Soyer said, "I won."
"And I said, "Gobby, you're not a winner," said Kelly.
You're just killed.
And you'll walk through it, you'll get well, and you'll get back stronger than ever.
Soldiers feel more sadness than respect
The event was a holiday at Wall Street, which collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock was sleeping with a ballade about helplessness, disappointment and loss.
A few hundred soldiers, sailors, fishermen, and seafarers were stationed around him.
The audience in the smukinga stole his stand.
"For the military, they looked like heroes," said David Salzman, who organized a collection of money.
The senior military officer at the concert, which was also the then Chairman of the Chiefs Committee, admirated Mike Mallen, saw the role of the army to the other.
"They were treated like orphans," wrote an officer in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers wanted it better.
I know that.
But in fact, it wasn't an honor, it was a regret.
The totally opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relations that have been established between the army and the often equivalent, sometimes shaken by the American public.
The soldiers are thanking them for their sacrifices.
But the praise is worth it, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting in such a way as to try to make people feel sorry for themselves.
"We're not all victims," said Brigadier General Shawn B. McFarland, who ordered troops in Iraq and is soon leaving Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way for some to show support is to deal with us as unhappy."
This is a sensitive topic for soldiers who do not want to look ungrateful or incorrigibly at the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger experienced by the returning troops in recent years in Vietnam has been much worse.
As a result, most of the mourning talks are quiet and only between war veterans.
After two of his sons returned from war operations in the seaports, Colonel Mark Kenshn warned them that non-commissioned people would look at their service from two perspectives.
Some will look at them with admiration because they had been exorbitant and exorbitant.
Others will wonder if there is “a mass of cruel weather”, said Kenshn, who fought in Iraq and returned to take a high government post in Washington.
While looking for work, he said he felt that some of the interviewees had asked carefully whether he would be able to keep up with the demands of responsible work in Washington immediately after the war had taken place.
Kenshn remembers saying to his sons, "When you talk about your service, you should count on the negative effect."
The indiscriminateness experienced by the military is partly due to the U.S. inequality in war.
Winnings in the field of combat are rarely granted thanks from a country that has little sign of the army and has little direct benefits from the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroism as it was perfectly in World War II," said General Lieutenant General David Berneau, who ordered US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, policy and public exorcism are mainly focused on the deep suffering of the soldier.
The troops estimate the number of advances they have made, the number of partners they have lost, or the extent of loss.
The army is facing increasing pressure from the parties to combat rape
It should be decided on this week at historical hearings whether 28 men and women will be prosecuted against the army in the absence of rape.
If not, hundreds of tunnels will be set up in the following direction.
Elizabeth Lyman, 25 years of age and 11 weeks of pregnancy, said she was raped by her servant at night.
It was in October 2008, she returned to her barracks at Miramar airport to the north of San Diego after she was married and met a man with a pack of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could get him to the room to drink.
"It was a beautiful flag," says Lyman.
But Tehasa's trainer gave up his fears.
I thought he was 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I'm sorry I didn't listen to my instinct at the time."
A few minutes after they entered Lyman's room, the man came back to her, broke and raped her, and claimed.
On this week, 18 November, Lyman and 27 other present and former military personnel will be forced to wait for the decisions of the court on the historic hearing that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and decide whether they will go to the court of inquiry against former Minister of Defence Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumfeld.
It is claimed that Gates and Ramsfeld were unable to deal with a wide range of military violence in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
In February, counsel Susan Berk of Washington, D.C., initially included 17 students, but an increase of up to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, who all claim to have been raped or threatened by sexual violence on the part of the staff, and that the army did not properly investigate, prosecuted, or provided appropriate justice after the alleged attacks.
Berk says she's focused on the army's top offices because the problem starts with them.
"Armia is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people who can destroy the culture of violence?
Berk also says that since February about 400 other victims have been contacted, many of whom can participate in future demands.
Its strategy: instead of collecting all the runners in this case, the class of all the eggs in one basket, so to say, it will open a lot of cases if it is necessary to support the pressure.
The Ministry of Defence's defence team under the leadership of the federal prosecutor, Nile McBride, took steps to stop the case.
The case-law documents received by Newsweek reveal a strategy for protection - mainly because former or current soldiers cannot submit military claims for damage suffered by the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the 1950 Supreme Court, the Federal Government is not responsible for the damage caused by those serving in the military.
“The alleged damage concerns the risk of the military service of hunters,” says the paper.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially prohibited from taking part in the war, this section exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldiers play an increasingly important role, especially in contacts with local women in the area of combat.
As a result, 150 women soldiers were killed during the two wars - two thirds of them in battle.
The army is also ready to become a modern one, says Berk.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her search, three others are ready.
At the Jail Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Seminar is preparing a case against four major military academys for the promotion of the feminist atmosphere.
A separate non-commercial union of American veterans in Vietnam is preparing a search for an army, in which the diagnosis of " personality changes" is aimed at the victims of violence to remove them from the service, a common phenomenon, such as Anu Bhagwati from the Human Rights Group of the Organization of Women ' s Workers.
Her group filed a complaint against the Veterans Office in December, accusing it of discrimination against the treatment of pensioners who claimed that there was a threat of sexual violence during the service.
Nine separate legislative drafts proposed a number of measures were introduced at the Congress of the senators and members of the Chamber of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, 3,158 rape attempts were reported by the Ministry of Commerce for Prevention and Combating Sexual Violence.
But, of course, the attacks are often not reported, and according to the Penetagona estimates, this figure is approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
This report, published in March, will also examine the percentage of cases: 20 per cent of cases were reported before the court in 2010 twice as much as in the civil justice system.
The others in Berk call attacks on them only the first in a number of other traumas.
In the case of Lyman, she said that she had been raped by the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she says, she was asked to tell the details of rape 11 times by police, doctors and commanders.
She collected evidence of rape, and the victim's blood was found on her hands.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat in front of the judges to hear her asking if she had been having sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six persons gave a positive character to the accused, which was finally justified.
"I remember the day I was reading the certificate," says Lyman.
"I thought I was born now - I ran away from the court hall with a cry."
"They put me in a psychiatric office, and when I went out, I remember my commander said, "It wasn't a trial, it was a trial for me."
Lyman was directed to a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed personality changes that made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was released with a negative wording, which did not allow her to receive any benefits.
The case raised by Lyman and her research partners is a complex issue, says John Terley, professor of law at the Law School of the University of George Washington.
But he says, "I think they're moving forward."
There is also a doctrine that has been criticized since it appeared.
I've been critical of Dr. Feres all my life.
The army has remained for decades because it does not have the incentives and means to hold responsibility.
He adds, "The odds are too much against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when ordinary people want to fight.
If the hearing doesn't work for them, Berk, a hunter lawyer, will collect hundreds of other hunters for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until reform is done," she says.
Or until we die, depending on what happens earlier.
The wall has eyes: How the researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming a new person of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Breyvik was an ordinary guy who exposed his anti-immigrants ’ views on the Internet.
On Monday, Bravik, who was found to have committed mass murder in Norway in July, where 77 people were killed, appeared at his first open hearing.
Although Brevik was able to act alone, he was far from alone on the network: he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, along with millions of nationalists who support the right groups in social networks.
After the summer tragedy, the researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
It's easy. You just have to go to Facebook.
"We understood that it was not easy to approach him," says Jamie Bartlett, the author of a recent report on the European cyber-populism of the British Research Centre DEMOS.
The staff data reserve at Facebook is so large, Bartlett says that researchers could easily use the site's advertising tool to identify the required demographic group with scientific accuracy - marketing and have been doing so for several years.
The Bartlett team discovered a million fans of right groups throughout Europe and then promoted a promotion, but instead of showing a new group or a diet product, the announcement offered the user an examination of the level of their education, violence and optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues, more than 10,000 participants of 14 parties to extreme rights in 11 European countries were even allowed to leave the office.
"It's a completely new way of doing research," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not so successful: right-wing online, mostly young men of sex who are under-immigrant immigration.
But suddenly, “those who combine their online activity with offline activity, are more reasonable, democratic and less aggressive than those who just go behind the monitor.”
DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new popular instrument in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and politicians use the website to study everything in the world, from health to social trends that are expressed in Lakes, wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users added to the average by three entries per day, the Facebook “super-active information” is a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles called the site at 800 per cent over the past five years.
For some researchers, Facebook has been able to study people who cannot go on the street with a block.
"Before, if you wanted to investigate people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You should be in the party, and they would never accept you," says Bartlett.
"Fiesbuck's off all of this - you're going straight to him."
Others say that this website could identify and explore social health issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleague showed that students who discussed their drinking habits at Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about it.
It is assumed that students' peers, for example their social teachers, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who is too often updating his drinking status.
"You can't solve the problem without discovering it," said Washington Post Dimitry Christakes, associate of Moreno and Director of the Centre for Children's Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute of Seattle.
"We have found a way to identify children from a risk group who would otherwise not have been identified."
The Facebook also constantly draws information about its users from different types of sources.
The website ' s data processing team has processed the statistics of relations statistics and the date of Saint Valentine, the mark of voters in the mid-2010 period, as well as the National Index of Happiness (mainly using information available only to them, cyberspace champions have long insisted that the site should make its extensive collection of data available to the public for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, they like it or not - in exchange for a chance to play in Scrabble with another person who is thousands of miles away from you, the site can process your personal data.
But how about when Facebook users become researchers they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict rules for the conduct of offline investigations, online data are available.
"I don't think that many users would have thought that the researcher could watch their profiles," says Neil Selvin, a sociologist from the London Sciences Laboratory, about the study he conducted in 2006 with the use of public sites of students in Facebook.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline has no guarantee that the study is very honest.
There is no way to know the number of information on the profile and on the user's page.
"What you're talking about on Facebook, and what you're doing outside Facebook, are two absolutely different things," says Selvin.
That is why, despite the years of its work in the field of technological research, Selvin believes that blockage and manuals are still the best research tools available.
"Nothing can replace the real world and society with real people," he says.
"Social studies are supposed to be social, and most of the social studies are still offline."
"The Cold and the Inhuman": Anders Bering Brewick will appear first publicly before the court
Anders Bering Brewick, a man who met in a double attack, which took 77 lives in Norway this summer, described himself as a fighter "opposite" during the first public appearance in the Oslo court.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian opposition movement and Ricaire Tamplier of Norway," he brought before 500 in court.
"I am against the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multilateralism."
"I admit my actions, but I don't admit my sins."
Judge Torkeel Nesheim stopped Brewik at the time of this monology because he "does not want to give Brewik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for expressing his own views".
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivík, who had brought a written statement earlier, to contact the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nassheim also ordered the police to keep Bravik under custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take strict control of all visits and censuses for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives visited the audience.
Some came in hopes of seeing Brewik in the eyes, others convinced that he was under the cover of darkness.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought it would look cold and inhuman," told the Norwegian NRK, one of the survivors of Utah.
"It wasn't comfortable, but personally it was a little easier for me after I saw and heard the suspect."
The wearer in the dark suit and blue gloves of Bravik kept calm and professionalism throughout the entire audience and looked at journalists and survivors when he entered and went out of the building.
Despite the strange idea that he was part of a major “opposite” movement, the judge decided that he was not too suspicious, and said that there was no evidence of what he was doing with the commissaries.
Some may be comforted by the fact that on 22 July attacks are said to be of one extremist rather than a radical group.
But this does not automatically reduce the anger and confusion that is now felt by all nations.
"I'd like him to look like a monster, but it's not," said one victim's relative.
"It would be much easier if it were."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' missing interview showing in the theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing a technical genius as the Great Moderner.
But what Apple fans can think of is the greatest openness in a newly discovered interview that they have recalled in advance of the preliminary show on the main markets this week, is how much this creative mind has understood in business processes and in manufacturing technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer and a hippie himself, but he was also a sufficient organizer and modernist of the manufacturing process, who believed that many business leaders had suffered from “diseases to think that the really great idea is 90 per cent of the work... [but] a great idea from the great product separates a huge amount of professional work”.
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley set up the Trimf Network Television on the appearance of a personal computer, and he spent more time with Jobs than a unique long-term bus.
By that time, about 10 years had passed since Jobs was released from Apple, and he had already worked at his new computer company NeXT in the hope of mass development on the Internet.
While the small part of Kringley's interview was used in Nerdeh, he says that the original interview was lost during transportation.
Only after the death of Jobs, a full VHS copy was found in the director's garage.
This removed material, recently edited, became the basis for the 68-minute Steve Jobs film: A underground interview that takes place in Landmark Theatres in this middle and fourth.
For a man who has a hatred for a detailed interview, Jobs here seems to be extremely willing to expose his technological philosophy and business strategy.
And amazingly smart.
In four different moments of interview there is a big gap between questions and answers -- reflections for 10-15 seconds, where Jobs clearly raises his thoughts to say more accurately.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism goes to the surface where he seems to be concerned about Kringley, which makes him move faster to matters or events of greater importance.
In the afternoon before the summer of Pixar, the Episcopals, and the Heathians, the interview was a bit more violent when Jobs assessed what he saw, how various companies were doing, and offered their own vision of future information technology.
One thing to read about the death assessments of Jobs' work, but there's something that's touching and inspiring in Jobs, which we see here is a frightening dream of a great size.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A small summary of seven significant conclusions of the interview:
About how he learned to run business:
"For all the time in the business, I kept asking, "Why do you do this?" And the answers that you've always got, "Oh, that's just what it does."
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks it's too deep in business.
That's what I knew.
Jobs continues to describe in detail his efforts to streamline the report in Apple.
The complex method of recording the costs, often starting with the standard costs, which were taken from the back and then raised with the "reduction" aid, has created an automated structure that guaranteed that they would be able to track business costs directly to the milk.
About pope:
Jobs describes in detail the "sin box" that he had with Steve Vuznik, a device that enabled people to break down the phone company effectively and call for a long time free.
The device was written a lot earlier, but Jobss is here describing the son of a doll as an act of devotion to authority.
He explains how he and Voznánk tested the boat using the telephone, ordering the conversation and then joining each other from the AT&T network until they reached as many stations as possible.
"We've covered the earth's surface once and you've called in the phone, and it's been a minute later in the next cell phone," says Jobs with a smile.
"We were young, and all we had adopted was that we could figure out something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both knew a little bit, but we could figure out a little thing that could control the big thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think it could ever happen to Apple without it.
Jobs continues to describe in detail one outstanding outcome that he and Voznánk had practically met by calling on the Vatican through the blue box at night and asking Papu's phone, but all efforts were made to copy Henry Kisinger.
When the various members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, they were shocked to hear how Pope himself was raised to answer the phone.
On technology enthusiasts (and the cold call of Bill Hulet):
When he was 12 years old, he found Bill Hullett on the phone and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute telephone conversation, Jobs received an summer training at the Hylett-Pacard.
"It had a powerful effect on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it shaped my view of how such company and how well they relate to their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP staff who visited the company's research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer".
He was the size of a shirt, he had a small monitor with an electronic tube, and I fell in love with him.
I've often been in the HP as a teenager, and I've been rolling around that machine and I've written for it.
On improvised innovation:
In a number of places, Jobs interview talks about the creation of new products at the airport.
On the other hand, when he was about to sell a lot of cash, a buyer asked him to collect his entire computer.
Working for 30 days in the loan, it had to be sold and collected, and the delivery of ready equipment.
Later in Apple, he recalls the difficulties he faced by developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the hot disputes... they called me that it would take five years to get a mouse that would be worth $300, and I was standing on top of it, and I got up, and I found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
On major energy-loss companies:
Long before he led Apple's return, Jobs accurately predicted that many industry leaders would fail to see the situation and lose control over their market share.
"Let me guess, you work in IBM or Xerox, so you do a better copy or a printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company does not become more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, thus [the type of people] who are then led by companies, and people who are making products are forced out of the decision-making area.
The genius of the product, which led to this monopolistic position, is impressed by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products -- the required skill.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could capture the entire information technology industry.
He could be ten times more, he could be a Microsof 90h...
They've won a victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"The big idea of a great product separates a huge amount of artificial work... when you turn a big idea, it changes and grows."
You'll know a lot about her strengths.
There are compromises you need to make -- some things you can't stop doing electronics, glass, jobs or jobs.
You need to keep in mind 5,000 ideas -- these concepts, bringing them together...
In the end, everything's going to taste -- everything's going to try to say the best things people have ever done, and later -- to try to get it into what you're doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists burn.
We were always ashamed to buy big ideas.
Part of the work done by Macintosh was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists and historians who became the best information technology specialists in the world.
If there were no information technologies, they would do things in other areas.
Scully and Thomas are engaged with the Health Act opponents until the court considers the case
On the day when the Supreme Court met at closed doors to discuss the political dispute, he would hear a copy of the Act on the Health of President Obama, two of his judges, Antona Skalía and Clarence Thomas, in favour of a dinner sponsored by a legal firm that would discuss the case before the Supreme Court.
This happened last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the application.
One of the agenda items was a request supported by 26 States that challenged the intensive health review adopted by the Congress last year by a law that unites conservative activists of all nations.
The judges agreed to consider the process; in fact, the reverse debate was expected to last 5 1/2 hours in March 2012, and the outcome would be almost a break in the presidential run, which would be at the very edge of the time when a judicial decision would be rejected.
A lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the health law must be abolished, at least by Paul Clement, who was the Deputy Attorney General at the time of President George W. Bush.
Clémenta's legal firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two companies that contributed to sponsoring the annual meal of the Federation of Federalists, a long-standing group that consistently adheres to conservative legal principles.
The second firm that sponsored lunch was one of the trade associations that violated the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, who has a huge financial interest in weight.
The dinner was held in the Washington Hospital a few hours after the trial.
He attended, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans of the Senate and a known opposer of the Health Act.
Starting guests at dinner?
Nothing new: two judges have been visiting the activities of the Federation of Federalists for many years.
And that doesn't go contrary to ethical standards.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the conduct of lower federal judges.
If they had submitted, they might have fallen under the principle of the Code 4C, which states: “The judge may visit the charitable activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge may not be a rapporteur, honourable guest or mentioned in the programme of such activities”.
Nevertheless, the apparent proximity of Skalia and Thomas to the two legal firms in this case, as well as to the company with large financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethics activists in the Government.
“This shocking violation of ethics and non-convention of the code contradicts the statements of some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules that will apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, President of the General Affairs.
"The judges have been exaggerating and prosecuted for the formal money collection with lawyers who are now under review in the court."
Their appearance and contribution to the collection of money for this event undermines all statements of impartiality and is unacceptable.
It is not easy to draw attention to critics who say that they are very eager to mix court cases with groups of the kind of federalists.
And Thomas' wife, Jenny, is a well-known conservative activist.
Furthermore, conservatives claim that this is an ethical issue with regard to Judge Elena Kagan, not to Skalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the chief legal service in Obama's administration when the first court objections against the law were filed at the court level of the first instance.
Her criticisms called for Kagan to refuse to listen to the case because she was too involved in the law at that time in order to be impartial now.
Kagan never showed that she was going to do that.
Boeing receives a record 18 billion commands on aircraft
The Emirates airline ordered 50 large-scale Boeing 777 and possibly 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, a transaction of over $1 billion.
It is not easy to know that the company receives an order for 50 units of its production.
But this is an important event when this company is a Boeing Co. aircraft builder, and the overcrowding price for all these 50 aircraft is $18 billion.
So important is where Boeing received orders: the Middle East, the growing gold of future orders on aircraft.
In the forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft at a cost of 450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced in these exits his largest dollar equivalent order on commercial aircraft - 50 two-way Boeing 777.
An incredible order came from Emirates Airport in Dubai.
The airline also has an opportunity to buy 20 more aircraft, which will raise a total overcrowding cost of up to $26 billion, Boeing reported on the Dubai Aviation 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing reported that Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, so-called Dreamliner, which could be significantly better fuel and more favourable for passengers.
Overcrowding costs for six aircraft would amount to more than $1 billion.
"It's really good for Boeing," said analyst Morningstar Nile Diora.
"The quality of these particular buyers is too high."
Many of the neighboring airlines have the power of non-profit countries.
Accordingly, they have not only money to pay for aircraft, but also an increase in fuel prices, which usually harm airlines, as one of the biggest items of costs is not so much lost because the country earns money at high oil prices.
It's important, just as they are less likely, unless other airlines cancel the order of aircraft when prices increase, Diora said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing's leadership on the market of large-scale aircraft and helps prevent the airbus SAS from attempting to reach its home with its A350 aircraft.
The victory of Boeing on the plane took place four months later after Airbus stated that it would defer the debt of the largest A350, which was against 777-300ER times.
He gave up the debt to increase the burden of debt after the buyers needed to increase the burden and distance of the flight.
Boeing Co shares increased by 1.5 per cent to 67.94 dollars.
Mexico President's sister apparently lost the election in Michigan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers assisted Fausto Valeho from the IPR in the pre-election race.
The sister of President Felipe Calderona seems to have failed to make her application to Governor Michocana in the time of the heavy government elections, and she said on Monday that drug dealers helped to remove the race for one of her opponents.
As a preliminary result, the leader in the run for the governor of the West State is named Fausto Valeho from the Institute-Revolving Party, or IRP.
"The involvement of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday, is concerned not only for Michigan but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview the next day after the resurrection.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral staff, they caught up with the polls, put restrictions on people, and prevented people from voting" for the IRP.
The IPR managed Mexico for seven decades until the presidency was lost in 2000.
She is preparing a return, and victory in Michigan is an important step in this attempt.
IPR hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Valeho, it seems that only a few rounds of Calderon, which led the ratings until the election day.
Calderon, a candidate from the National Action Party, or a PND headed by her brother, refused to acknowledge Valeho as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate from the left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or the DPR, which now belongs to the ruling class, has come to the third -- a serious blow to the split and unsuccessful left before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aurelos also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Valeho, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, rejected the relationship with drug dealers and called on other candidates to acknowledge the results.
In Michigan, drug dealers specializing in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines have been operating for a long time.
It was the native state of President Calderona, and he elected Michowan to launch a military operation against drug dealers in December 2006.
Violence continues to exist.
The PND mayor was killed a week before the elections, when he attacked Luis Mario Calderon, and several candidates left the local pre-election race because of fear.
For the IPR, however, the choice in Michoacana would be disastrous, and the victory would be a driving force of the party.
A man who was to represent the IPR in the presidential run, Henrik Penna Nut, speaking from Washington, welcomed Valeho and said, "I think this victory should be very exciting in the next year."
ABR persuades Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank was committed to India and China to be ready to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis in order to avoid the long-term fall that would stop the Asian economy from growing.
Rajat Nag, director of the ABB office in Manila, said that two of the fastest growing economies should “do everything they can” to speed up the recovery of the currency block with the assistance of the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries considered Europe's difficulties "free," and said that the Asian financial support for the side of European leadership and resources could help to avoid long-term fall in the global economy.
"It's all about us."
"That is why anyone who can help Europe choose from the crisis is useful," he reported Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but may not be vulnerable."
"So if China and India can help, this must be done."
The European monetary union has been severely affected by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing funds have grown alarmingly, and both the Prime Minister and Greece have gone away.
The long-term crisis in Europe created fears that it could again bring the world economy to a halt, and called on the leading economies to gather together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Ning predicted that any Asian aid would be carried out through the IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation, a type of purchase of the EU financial assistance fund, provided a means of ensuring financial stability in Europe, provided a great deal of strength in the negotiations with Asian partners in Europe.
And Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India does everything possible" to help the eurozone, as its own economy is experiencing a reduction in exports and a reduction in foreign capital.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and tense," he said.
"We have tremendous tasks, and we must maintain high levels of growth."
"It's an impossible option, it's a mandatory condition, because where we find work for tens of millions of our young people and girls."
Others claim that India ' s developing economy has no reason to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshni, a professor at the University of Brown in the United States, said that it would be very difficult from a political point of view to provide European assistance to 1.2 billion Indians, of whom about 800 million live on $2 a day or less.
"At some point they know that the Greeks go to retirement in 50 years and spend their holidays at sea, and that will not be well understood," he said.
Li Howell, Director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India ' s reserves should be used to contain Greek-based and well-paid public-sector workers in ill-organised, waste-intensive enterprises, such as railways.
Mr. Ning said that the eurozone crisis was threatening "significant direct consequences" throughout Asia.
ABB's forecast of 7.5 per cent economic growth in Asia in 2011/12 has now been faced with "degradable risks" due to threats from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets need to draw up emergency plans to protect themselves from the loss and significant flows of capital from their economies.
Fearful warning of the potential reduction in defence costs
The Minister of Defence Leon Pannett at the Congress on Monday warned that the expected automatic budget reductions would undermine national security and call for a financial core response from the Pentagon corridors to the field of war in Afghanistan on the lines and to the civil assembly.
The Pentagon has already been reduced by $450 billion in the coming decade, but it is now feared that additional reductions of 600 billion or more could be avoided if the convention could not reach a cost agreement.
"The consequences of these reductions will be devastating to the ministry," Paneta reported in a letter to the senators of the Republic of John McCain, Arizona, and the Republic of Lindsey Griham, South Carolina.
He said that the inability of the Congress to agree on the budget and the resulting result of the so-called segment had begun a total reduction of 23 per cent and the end of many new projects.
"So severe reduction, which is so improbable, makes most of our shipbuilding and construction impossible -- you cannot buy three quarters of ships or buildings -- and seriously damage other modernization attempts," wrote the Senators.
“We also have to fire many of our state workers and, as the reduction will be done so quickly, we will have to fire the state to achieve the goal.”
"These changes will undermine the trust of those who support our army and seriously damage our preparedness."
The cuts in the final accounts are affected by the military, Pannetta said.
" While military funding in foreign emergency operations is not directly affected by the sector, military achievements are seriously affected by serious budgetary turmoil," Paneta warned.
“Contract personnel will be reduced to conclude the termination of contracts and oversight treaties supporting the army.”
“Situated staff will be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be broken.”
Two senators wrote Panette 10 days ago asking for details of the possible effects of automatic reductions in the Ministry of Defence.
“After the Secrecy of the Ministry of Defence, the United States will soon fall as a world military leader.”
"We are constantly opposed to these dramatic actions," the senators reported in a joint statement on Monday evening when they announced the letter of the Pannetta.
"It's not the way we can live with, and it's not the way we're supposed to be. "
"Second is a threat to the interests of national security of the United States, and this cannot happen."
Whether the letter of the Panetta or the latest warnings of senators will be delivered to the budget compromise or the call for the release of the Pentagon from the cuts will be seen later.
The Panetta was absolutely sincere about the possible reductions, although he had come to work under the direction of the Pentagon after many years of budgetary expertise in Congress and the White House and was aware that he was facing a difficult election.
At a press conference last week, the Defence Minister drew an unusual picture of what could be followed by an army with a face but without a core.
"It's a ship without sails."
"It's a field without a ball."
"It's a wingless plane without enough prepared pilots."
"It's a warehouse tiger, army with kasarms, buildings and bombs without trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in her opening remarks to the Pentagon.
"It is a force suffering from an insatiable battle spirit, a bad readiness and unable to fight potential enemies."
"In fact, it promotes aggression."
In the annex to his letters to McKenna and Greham Pannett, new details have been made about how reductions " create significant operational risks: delay the response to crises, conflicts and disasters; seriously restrict our ability to be the first to deploy and react to the world; and pose an unacceptable risk to future military operations".
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could be faced with obstacles, including those already tested, and some only at early stages of planning.
This list includes a single striker F35, a new bomber, a ballistic submarine ship of a new generation, a new coastal zone battleship, and a new ground-based vehicle, which the Army and the Navy are required to replace.
The continuation of further development and testing of F35 may save $80 billion in 10 years, but its parties say that this is a vital step towards improving and countering the potential threats of China and other opponents.
How to Deal With Lies
A quick look at the last chapters shows how serious and widespread lying and deception are in daily life.
Canada's presidents of the Republic of Herman Cain have been accused of sexual harassment by several women; each party has accused another of lying.
The Administration of the University of Pennsylvania has been charged with lying, as they have been hiding the fact that a football trainer has raped boys.
Last week, French President Nicola Sarkozi was arrested when the United States President Barako Obama told the United States President that Israeli Prime Minister Binjamin Netanyihu was a liar.
The lie breaks down careers and tears the country apart.
Congressman of New York and Internet exhibitor Anthony Weiner had betrayed himself, denying his findings that there was no clear evidence at all.
The former candidate, John Edwards, was charged with financial engineering during the campaign to establish relationships.
Again, none of those living at that time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, who was lying about his sexual relations with Monica Levinski during his second term in office.
The history of fraud at school and college is an ordinary matter.
There were cases when the teacher gave the students an answer to the tests so that they could have a good evaluation of the results of their work.
Teachers who must teach the opposite are sending a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
During one day, as studies show, you may be given 10 to 200 times.
It is now assumed that a significant part of this is a lie in salvation.
Another study showed that unknown people were three times the first 10 minutes of dating each other.
The identification of a lie or a lie is necessary for every skill, both for personal and professional purposes.
In contrast to the space game, it seems to say, the shadow where to call "Study!" is a serious direction of knowledge based on scientific data collected in the prestigious universities of research projects, especially on psychology and physics.
One result of the study is that most of the old lies have been invented.
The liers look in the eye.
They don't always stop, they say, they're beautiful or they're tired.
There is no need to conclude that lies are difficult to detect and difficult to pay.
The test seller of lies can come to the truth by observing the structure of approvals, minimizations, issues structure and temporary characteristics.
I have spent several years studying scientific discoveries in a wide and constantly growing segment of false knowledge, and it is clear that the identification of lies is a modern skill that is easy to learn and that helps us to focus on our complex world, especially if your professional responsibilities include recruitment, meeting, negotiation or management.
Good people are able to read aloud to others, allowing them to feel uncomfortable, to control their own emotions, and to feel the way others do.
We know from the study that extraterrestrials are more red than introverts, that men are more likely to lie about themselves, while women are more likely to protect some sense that women are less likely to be angry with their partners than women (but the lies they say are more often than they insist on).
We also know that if you are perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty when they deceive you.
How do you understand? Is anyone lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your object.
It is called “the definition of the status of origin”.
This will help to provide a starting point for further evaluation of changes.
Watch your object's voice, smile, voice characteristics.
It would be good for you to know if a person keeps his feet on the right track, then you will not make unfair accusations when you see his feet slip in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for groups of false verbatim and non-verbal actions.
You are referring to these groups as red flags, not to evidence of fraud.
Depressors can fix the upper part of their body when they try to remember their history, they can put their steps towards the door, move out, change their post in a certain way, or demonstrate "enlightenment after interview" — this overhaul of ease and change of position when all complex issues are behind.
Follow-ups often falsify the end of the investigation to simply look at this facility after the interview.
So, pay attention to the word of your object.
It is well known that Scott Peterson was injured and used the past, claiming that his murdered wife was alive, which led to her search throughout the country.
Depressive people can also use the phrase "I had no sexual relations with this woman ... Miss Levinski" or to repeat the complex question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely catchable.
Someone can use the "qualification language" when answering the complex question, "Horosha... I'm telling the truth... how much I know... how much I know."
This provides a response faster than the actual emotional response and is often a red flag.
There is no magic device to detect a lie, but to have the ability to detect fraud.
These skills increase the chances of each individual not to become a victim of professional and personal life.
The oil pipeline plan needs to be revised after the United States threat has been approved
A few days later, when Obama's administration threatened to suspend the approval of planned oil pipelines from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- caused by the anger of trade unions, but calmed by environmental defenders -- a company that was building oil, it claimed that it would be willing to review the project in order to resume work on it.
TransCanada reported on Monday evening that it would pick up planned oil from the environmentally sensitive zone of Pescan Holms in Nebraska and be assured that the project would still be approved.
The company called for this decision at a press conference in the capital of Nebraska.
The official representative of TransCanada Alex Purbas says that the company remains confident that it will finally receive the approval of oil pipelines, even with other routes.
This will take place following the State Department's statement last week that it will defer a decision on a federal project until it will examine new possible routes that do not affect the area of the Pescha del Holms of Nebraska and Ogala, the vast underground reservoir of water.
"It's a real step forward," said Fox News Congressman Li Terry, a Republican of Nebraska.
The new environmental expertise commissioned by the Department of State will be largely due to the decision by 2013, after the elections in the following year, although the authorities have rejected that policy.
Both in the written statement last week called for a decision on the call of the State Department and expressed support for it.
Petroleum of 1,700 miles shall be extended from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It must transfer 700,000 barrels a day from Albert's province to the oil-producing plant in Texas.
In order to do this, he needs more than six states.
It is hated by environmental defenders, but they love trade unions, which are expected to have some 20,000 jobs related to petroleum water.
However, the Nepalese legislators against the plan are considering a draft law to speed up the movement from the Pescan Valley area and the Ogalala River, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current State Department's study on environmental impacts showed that the project would only have a limited negative impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry stated that the Department's auditor had ordered a separate review procedure on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist named TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a consultant at Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign, represents a conflict of interest to the programme.
Secondly, it was the choice of a company that was hired to conduct the initial study that was inappropriate, as it was related to TransCanada.
At Patty LaBell's court, because she called the son of a bitch out of fear.
The New York family claims that the disco-dive Patty LaBell began to live in the lobby of their home in Manhattan, threatening their younger daughter to such a degree that there was no fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" executive Tirad threatened 18-month Geneva Monk so strongly that it translated "a change of personality, a disturbance of sleep" and "a strong fear of strangers," said her family in the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
This happened on November 10th last year when Kevin Monk, his wife, a nurse, Rosana, and Geneva were on their family trip.
While Kevin Monk was hunting the car, Rosanna Monk landed in the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building with their luggage, carried to Geneva.
Rosanna Monk said she stood by the door and dropped her daughter in half a minute.
"Someone came back to me and said, "You know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and she went to take her," she said.
LaBell took the lead in making a decision for a pregnant woman.
"It was aggressively done, "You shouldn't have left your daughter at the door," said Rosanna Monk.
"I said to her, "I don't care what you say or think."
It came into the light and began to use the rhymes -- the word C and the word F -- on the high tones...
She had a bottle of water, and she started drinking water from the bottle on me.
She said that Geneva had a history.
"I said to this woman, "See what you did with my daughter," said the mother.
LaBell was born to a mother, who still held Geneva, and her companion had to hold her in a waiting car, said Rosana Monk.
The baby cried so hard that it stopped, it added.
Later, the family sent LaBell a note asking for an apology but did not receive an answer.
Lawyers and representatives of LaBell are not responding to calls for comments.
The amount of compensation for the damage is not reported, but family lawyer Sam Davis said that he took the case free of charge and that the family is planning to sacrifice any money that will, for the benefit of children, be given to sick cancer.
"The goal is to stop Patty LaBell from taking responsibility for his actions," said Davis.
“This behavior is completely unacceptable, especially in relation to a child with an 18-month-old child on his hands.”
Climate problems have slowed the economy
During the first year of the government of Mario Lopes in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labour market grew, foreign funding decreased and the economy was weakened.
2011, which will lead to the economic history of Sinaloa as the first year of the Government of Mario Lopes Valdes, as well as the so-called change, which has given rise to great hopes for economic development, but in view of the adverse climate conditions of the beginning of the year, growth has not been recorded, but the main economic development indicators have been reduced.
The low temperatures in February not only contributed to the loss of millions to the agricultural sector, but limited public economic growth, resulting in a decrease in overall economic activity by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly due to the historical fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to a report on the areas affected by the sea provided by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 835,582 hectares were affected by 78.03 per cent of them, and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially affected.
The decline in economic activity has led to a steady rise in unemployment in the country, according to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters the rapid increase in unemployment was established, from January to March 55.053 of the population of Sinaloa was unemployed, from 4.53 per cent of the population of the second quarter to 5.28 per cent, and from July to 6.19 per cent of the population of Sinaloa, which is more than 18.969 per cent compared to the first half.
Reduction of liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa has been discussed over the year by many factors, for economist Gerardo Lopes Servantes, Director of the Economic and Social Sciences Department of the University of Autonomics (UAS), the increase in unemployment can be explained in detail by actions undertaken in public policy.
"What we now see is the growth of unemployment, which is related to a number of factors, including loss of liquidity on the market, in order to limit the resources imposed by the law that was adopted at the Congress to combat money laundering, as well as people who illegally hold dollars, simply to invest and use them in something," he said.
Immigrants
Lopes Servantes said that unemployment is still a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country in search of jobs abroad has been limited in the United States, firstly because of the difficulties with entry, and secondly, as once they have entered, they have already faced very many difficulties in finding jobs, so that the group remains and needs jobs here, in the state, as a result of rising unemployment," he said.
Infringement of formal requirements
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa will become worse if it is to focus on the large number of violations that prevail in working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the state's active population is working without being mentioned as workers in a social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and malformation, there is another reminder of employment in the state of low wages; in the states the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was 5,352 pesos, much lower than the average country, consisting of 7,375 pesos.
Reduction of PICs
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high unemployment rate in 2011, the largest direct foreign investment in the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, was $630,697, reflecting a drop of 87.74 per cent compared to $5,143,312 over the same period last year.
On the other hand, the Government ' s Ministry of Economic Development has fixed a total of 17.28,000 pesos of investments during the year, mainly from services companies.
Length
On the basis of the economic downturn, the Government had requested in July the State Congress to approve the loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be used for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities in order to sustain the economy at the local level, and until November no state economy benefits were expected.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the Government of Mario Lopes Valdes has demonstrated a lack of government capabilities.
Miguel Lopez, President of the National Chamber of Industry, said that during 2011, there was no consensus among the various sectors, including the Government itself.
"The economic efficiency of Sinaloa this year has been very low, and there is much work to be done to restore the positions lost this year, we have to double our efforts in 2012, we have not been able to agree everyone's efforts and, above all, the good and synchronous work of the new Government team, we hope that the next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowdown
Lopes Loredo said that events such as early droughts had stopped the state economy this year and its efficiency and growth had been limited.
"The low levels of economies are the result of several events, including the sea, one of the main effects of the slowing economy, which is not fast enough to create economic dynamics, which enables us to have an acceptable level of processes, goods and services, and thus, at the end of the year, we close it below our expectations," he said.
Revision of addresses
Theodore Salazar Uriarte, President of the Conference of the Workers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that the state needed to continue its dynamic production activity.
“In general, we have found that we have worked on this, we believe that a long-term programme, which will redesign the direction and economic course of the state, needs to mobilize all the material and human resources available to Sinaloa,” he said.
Present work
President Coparmex stressed the importance of determining the future direction in order to better direct the efforts of the Government.
“In general, I would say that the Government is trying to succeed in various areas, there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme,” he said.
He noted that the current administration had shown progress in its own way of managing public policy.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the Government is starting to work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the Government knows that much more is needed," he said.
He's being sentenced to 8 kilograms of marijuana.
Five years of imprisonment and fines for 100 days, such a sentence was handed down to the citizens of Navolat for the custody of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney-General reported that the convicted drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valenswell Sandoval, who was convicted of a health offence, was imprisoned in this case for the purpose of spreading.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valensuel Sandval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 during the patrols of the streets of Cyprus, before heading No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was behind the role of a white pickup car, where he carried a black bag in the car bag, and on the passenger seat, a small hole where soldiers discovered eight pounds and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, it was transferred to the Second Regional Court, while the accused continued to remain in the Centre for Support of the Legal Effects of Crime.
Contributions to work must be made
Social work related to programmes such as the Family, the Rescue of Public Space and 3x1 for migrants is at risk of being incomplete or long-term because of lack of funds, Miguel Angel Lopes Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although the work programmes had been developed, they were at risk, as the Government was unable to make appropriate contributions, which constituted an amount exceeding 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding of all three programmes consisted of about 50 million pesos, of which 25 per cent had to be provided by the State, and so far only the Federation and the Municipalities had provided resources for the work, so it was still possible to delay their completion.
"They have to put up about 12 million, and even though the year ends, they didn't give us any copies when they were to give us part of it from the beginning of July," he said, "that we don't give up, we started the work and they're very advanced, but we need money."
He noted that during the last year, during the reign of Hesus Agrilara Padilla, the State had not made contributions to be made, so that money had to be spent at the beginning of the term of office of the municipality in order to cover more than 7 million, which had not been granted in that case by the administration of the State.
“This has happened to us in the previous administration because the state has no financial capacity to participate, and the programmes have continued to develop, and this year to access these programmes, we need to find resources to cover what remains of the state,” he explained.
While the State authorities have an obligation to deliver these resources, he says that the request was made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, to increase efforts so that the percentages associated with them come as soon as possible.
"They have to bring up nearly 12 million, and even though it's over for a year, they haven't given us any copies."
The Court adopted the “Courage of Digital Television” in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue signals to digital is one of the most important changes that have made the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court (WS) rejected the constitutional claims made by the representatives of the Senate and the House against the Presidential Decree, which carried the so-called “digital television transition” from 2021 to 2015, since there were no eight votes needed for its cancellation.
At least four ministers, including the President of the Court, Huana Silvo Mes, felt that President Felipe Calderon had not exceeded his mandate, issued a decree detailing actions to move to digital television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate were rejected because of the lack of a qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to express its constitutionality or non-institutionality, and it remained in force.
The draft declaration prepared by Minister Olgo Sanchez Cordero was proposed to declare a non-institutional decree because the regulation of the radio and television programme was a right under the Law of the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical co-ordination and the legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted for the project.
In this argument, both the Senate and the House of Representatives have held two constitutional debates in order to refute and support the claim, Minister Sanchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and all the actions referred to therein regarding the conversion to digital content.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to reject the request of the House of Representatives, not to enter into the discussion of the draft, as well as under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the draft in the sense that the federal executive authority could not determine the general rules of action to which the government should prepare.
“I also do not think that this would have an effect on the autonomy of the governing body”, and I recalled that State policy planning in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, has a bearing on the federal executive authority with a constitutional mandate, the rule of the State.
The replacement of analogue signals to digital -- one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years -- has led to better use of radio spectrum, better quality of signals and more channels.
Releasing the transition, he said, would mean reimbursing benefits from the digital transformation, which includes meeting the public needs of which “is not only a technical measure, as it covers economic, social, political and national security issues”.
These issues, he said, “need the work of the entire system, which is based on the principle of public economic governance, includes a group of authorities that the Constitution unites with the State executive authority”.
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the digital shift, and it had done so with the assistance of the executive authority, despite the existence of specialized technical agencies.
It cannot be concluded, therefore, that the Government, by adopting the proposed decree, which, in any event, affects the competence of the Congress, provides administrative compliance with the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, said.
In Michigan, they analyze the possibility of counting "vote vote"
According to the data submitted in the PPE, the difference between the first and second in the governorial elections is 27 per cent, even without the vote of 879 of the total of 6,074 protocols.
The possibility of voting support is real, with regard to the electoral process in Michigan this year, where, according to data obtained from the preliminary election results programme (PRF), the difference between the first and second places in the governorate elections is 27 per cent, even without the total number of 879 votes in the 6.074 protocols.
In the light of this, the President of the General Council of the Institute of Elections of Michigan (IVM), Maria de Los Anheles Lianderal Saragos, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body had adopted a set of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michowan did not accept the Constitution or the Electoral Code of the State or the Electoral Law, as the Congress approved reforms immediately before the legal date of their entry into force in the electoral process and that Governor Lionel Year Rangel did not include his publication within the time limit set out in the Act in the Official Journal of the State, stating that he had some objections.
On that same day, 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (JJJ) adopted a decision on the constitutional claim issued by the local legislative assembly and called the “ineffective and illegal” vote of the representative of the State on constitutional reform, since he did not have the right to “delegate or support them”.
In an interview on the possibility of "vote vote", Maria de los Anheles Lianderal stated that with the adoption of the appropriate principles, the IVM General Council would be able to submit a partial or complete vote by the local electoral body.
Thus, a partial recalculation of one or more electoral urns may be made provided that: the results of the protocols do not match; there is no protocol for voting and supporting documents in the urn or is not available to the President; or when there are obvious errors or corrections in the protocol.
In addition, the general counting of votes in all polls may take place where there is evidence that the difference between the proposed candidate and those who received the second place in the vote, less or less than one per cent, is shown at the beginning of the session, provided that an application was made by the representative of the party and/or the coalition that represented the second of those candidates.
The overall vote will also be taken if, at the end of the ordinary record, it is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate taking second place is less or equal to one per cent, provided that there is an application from the political party that the candidate has taken second place, when electoral urns are excluded, which have been taken into account in part.
It is noted that in this situation, there are elections in Morelia, where, according to the PPE, the difference between the first and second places is only 0.16 per cent, even without a total of 129 votes in 923.
His last will.
His dust will be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinam, confirming the family.
The rest of the pilot, Felipe Basio Cortes, arrived in Saltillo, his hometown on the evening of the evening; a demonstration and a pleasant meal were held on Monday.
According to the family, the last wish of the Colonel was to develop his dust in the mountains of Sapalinam.
After a collision with others who had died in a disaster, the Basio Cortez family returned to the capital of the Gulf of the Mexican Air Force, where the closest people visited the Camp Marte.
On the afternoon of the afternoon, the colonel arrived at a time on the bulvar of Nazario Ortis Garcia, where families and friends had arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., he attended the exhibition of the Santillo Institute of Technology organized by his former high school uniforms and football team, who was a member of Felipe Basio during high school.
"His wish was to return to Saltillo, and his dust was blown up in the mountains of Sapalinama, he always said it to his family and friends," said Sandra Cortes Basio, the pilot's sister.
In her opinion, the Lieutenant has fulfilled all his dreams, she thinks that he was on the track of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a loving brother given to his family."
Felipe Cortes Basio left the very young city of Saltillo to go to the aviation college in Sapapane, Halisco.
Some didn't believe him, they said that he had his head turned even in the truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Horhe Alberto David Basio remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to welcome him as he brought Marto Saagun to Saltillo."
She recalls that even when he was seven years old, he lived in Sapopan at a graduation ceremony for his family, so he knew that his grandfather had died doing what he loved most in life: controlling the plane.
He's being chased for the last time.
Fires from the weapons have increased in honour of Lieutenant Colonel Cortes Basio, led by Governor Jorge Torres Lopes, people from the village and Government of the state, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, themselves, the leaders and students of the Technical Secondary School in Saltillo, where he was trained and trained successfully and in sport.
Basio Cortes died recently when the helicopter he controlled suffered a breach, along with the Secretary of the Government of the province, José Francisco Blake Moroi, and six others, all representatives of the Ministry.
At 18:05, the rest of Basio Cortes, the inhabitants of Saltillo, came to be transferred to the Mexican Air Force headquarters with Major James Martinez at the training school, where he was already expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife, his mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three bodies found on the farm of NL Kaderieta
Within hours of the discovery, the military authorities showed in the media ten persons who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found to be shot dead in various parts of the body, with a control shot at a ruined farm in the village of Kaderie Hymenes, Nuevo Leon.
The find was found at 1.5 kilometres away from Santiago, at the heights of the municipality known as El Castillo.
Several people who had gone by noted that in a wooden house whose walls had been torn down in a refugee and a Korean wall, the doors were open.
Looking inside, literally three meters, they discovered the bodies of three people, they immediately informed the authorities.
One of the men was walking in a yellow football with black gins, without shoes, and with him there was another man in a white mother.
In one metre, the body of another was in the red rupees and the blue gins.
All three were lying down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed in another place, as there was no hail.
At the door of the wooden house, there are signs of one organized criminal group, and there are several kinds of pulses in it.
11th in Kadrey
The Ministry of National Security presented 11 persons, including minors, who were part of a criminal group that was mainly in the municipality of Kadrey and who were charged with kidnappings, killings, fraud and secret funerals.
According to the information published, eight persons were arrested on 11 November in the Los Alvero colony, and one person in detention was rescued.
They were provided with three homes and telephones, demanding to be members of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
The second event took place on 12 November at 06:00 a.m., and the military personnel were on patrol in the old Rancho village of Kadrey when they saw a car with no numbers with two men in the hall.
He left them and carried out an inspection, the soldiers found a bottle of wine, a patrol and 18 patrols.
Following those statements, on 13 November, one of their communiqués was established in the public land of La Pradda, which, seeing the military, tried to escape.
He is accused of secret funerals in the municipalities of General Teran, Heina and Kaderiet.
A new Italian Government will be formed in the middle
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce a new government that is facing the crisis that has put that country on the brink of economic disaster.
The Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy to introduce a new Government, which is faced with the crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and the most damaging damage to the whole euro area.
A statement from the Presidential Chamber stated that Monti, appointed on the afternoon, would meet with President George Napolitano to confirm that he could form the Government.
It is expected that it will represent a cabinet composed mainly of technology, although it is unlikely that the new executive authority will take its positions.
Monty said he would present the results of his negotiations with political parties in his attempt to shape the Government.
"I want to confirm my full confidence in our country's ability to choose from this difficult period," said the former European Commissioner to the rapporteurs.
Monty did not directly say that he was able to form a government, but his comments showed that the obstacles were overcome.
"The structure is now very focused," he said.
Monty completed the government-building process less than three days ago, which was much less common, as Italy was struggling with the political and financial crisis, which raised its debt at critical level.
The administration under the leadership of former European Commissioner Monty must adopt a package of the hard economy required by European leaders to return to Italy.
On the basis of the pressure on Monty to speed up, unstable markets have established income from Italy's BTP bonds for 10 years more than 7 per cent, at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marchegalia, head of the Italian Federation of Workers, told the reporters after a meeting with Monty: “We have been told that we will actively support this Government.”
We believe that this Government is the last chance Italy has to get out of this critical situation.
Chances Monty were successful in supporting the LDP party Silvio Berlusconi, which was forced to leave on Saturday because of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monty's efforts must lead to a good outcome," said reporter Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Central Right Party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the majority of the Government, which is composed of the Montenegrins.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monti must have strong parliamentary support for reform, which will probably be the most popular reforms in the hard economy.
Any blockage or cessation of these attempts can lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has intensified pressure by warning that the loss of Monty could be a disaster.
On Monday, Monti began consultations with political parties, associations and business groups, as well as with youth and women ' s organizations.
He ends his meeting on Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed in the resurrection of Napolitano, which allowed a very rapid transition into response to the crisis.
After a short delay at the end of last week when it became clear that Berlusconi would withdraw, Italy's debt had now reached a critical level on the basis of uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would succeed.
Italy's state debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for modern financial defenders of the euro area.
Monty said that his Government would exist before the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite the widespread forecasts that policies would only allow him time for reform before the new elections.
Monty said he wanted to include policies in his office, but the main parties insisted that he should be made up only of technical experts, indicating that he was not satisfied with the financial situation in the process.
Political sources have reported that mutual mistrust and non-conformity of parties have made it difficult to include political figures.
In Spanish game experience more than in Tikos
Ten of the 22 games in Spain have already played at 50 international matches.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 claimed players played 50 matches.
A small contrast with Costa Rica, compared to the 22 games generated by both countries on a friendly match today at 3:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While in World Championships and Europe, the number one in the month rating FIFA, there is a whole list of Class A election games in Tricolora, there is only Michael Ummana as the only one who has played 50 international games.
This figure was achieved last Friday in the game against Panama (0-2), at the stadium called Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers playing in the League of All Stars and in the powerful British Premier League clubs were very active during this year in league and in local Cuban clubs, and they were high-level players in European Cups and League champions.
This should add to the experience of the Spanish Forum in a complex qualification in Euro or the World Championship.
The Tikos games, however, have limited international experience in the CONCAAF-type zone, which is considered to be the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that the list is headed by the Spanish collective golfer Iker Cassilias, who, last week against England (a match left 0-1 in London) re-enacted the record of former footballer Andoni Subhisarret, with 126 international matches.
Cassilias is playing against Tricolora today and will set up a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
In Hawaii, Ernandez, the Barcelona game, 106.
Cassillas and Hawaii were better recognized last week with the other Iberian team, Subhisarret, with 126 battalion and Shalk Raul Gonzalez with 102.
Nearly a hundred Charles Pueol with 97 games.
Javier Alonso followed them with 91, Fernando Torres - with 90, David William and Sergio Ramos, both with 81, Andrés Injesta - with 62, Sesk Fabregas - with 61 and David Silva - with 53.
On the coast of Costa Rica, along with Michael Umman, on the left side of Hunuor Dias with 48 matches and a bomber Brian Ruiss, from 45.
In addition, only five crossed the border in 30 games: Taylor Navas with 31, Randall Asofhefa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Ernandez with 36 and José Luis Lopes with 35.
I'm leaving.
More than 30 mothers in Spain, Gerara Pike (37), Serhio Buskets (36), Santiago Cassorle (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albio (31).
In a collection of less than 30 exits, there is Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badley with 25 and Roy Murray with 23.
The rest didn't even get up to 20.
When Nach Moreall had only four games, and Hordy Albe - two, in Costa Rica in Victor Bolivara alone, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder had not yet been debuted.
The leading Spanish game, David Willa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica Brian Ruiss became the one who brought more glasses in two times more than Carlos Ernards and three times more than Roy Murray and Parks.
Quintet has introduced the country to the turn in respect of 20 years of career
The trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true
In an exclusive interview, Viva Basil Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said that the group was ready to give one of the best concerts on the next day at the National Stadium.
It was more than 20 years ahead, but the group said that it was also a dream that they would be able to play in this country.
This was the approval of the bassist and founder, Jeff Amenta, who gave the exclusive interview of Viva from Brazil last week.
The Group is located in the territory of South America in the course of the twenty-first year of work and, on Wednesday, 20th, its sole residence in Central America.
On that day, they will appear at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 a.m., with a team from Los Angeles The X and the local group of Las Robertas.
It's a waste from the pocket, full of encryption available online in The Nation.
For your fans from Costa Rica it's an emerging dream that Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica?
The trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
It's only our second visit to South and Central America, and it's still going well.
I was in Costa Rica only once - this is a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
That's why we're so happy to bring our music here.
I ask this because there are some group loyalty; fans live in a hurry the day before the concert.
What will you say to your favorite fan?
Thanks for being with us all those years.
We had to get to Costa Rica for almost 21 years, thanks for waiting so long, and we regret that we had to spend so much time here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, refer to it as the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played in the past 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We had a couple of great shows in San Paulo and we hope that this led us to this concert in Costa Rica.
Actually, we really want to play here.
We love this country, we love to take care of Serfing and Jungle, which is one of the best countries in the world, Costa Rica.
How did you find out about Costa Rica and her surfing waves?
We have a lot of friends serfs, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the wolves here are amazing.
My friends are always enjoying serfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, as well as in Mexico, these excellent places for serfing, as we have learned about it from people who love serfing.
Looking at the tower, you can say that you've done a grand show with a lot of songs.
What are you planning to say in Costa Rica?
As we have never played there before, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We're trying to make the best show with the best songs we can; we're trying to play a couple of songs from each album and present to our fans a wide variety of repertoires.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How is that possible?
I think that's partly because we have nine plastics and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in the tone and surprises us, because it reminds us of why we loved these songs and what we could forget.
It makes the show more interesting for us, and that's why I think it makes it more interesting for people.
In this tour, you notice 20 years of career.
Looking back, it's hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think that none of us could ever imagine that we would be in the rock-group and that what we've been doing for more than 20 years makes it like a dream.
We are happy for our success, and we are very excited that we can continue to create music together.
We all love each other and we love to create music.
We are happy to find places in the world where we always wanted to go.
Everything is very successful for us.
What does it mean for you to be a major part of the border color?
It has always been a privilege to be part of this group of great collections.
We're good friends with the kids from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's nice when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and that's unusual.
From time to time, a group from one city appears, but much more strange when five or ten groups appear at the same time in one city.
We're proud to be part of the Seattle team.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at the Alice in Chains festival and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we were happy to be friends with them all and for us the honor of being part of Seattle's voice that was received.
It is also very strange that the group of your species will remain together and that it will be the same for so long.
Yes, four of us were 21 years old together, and Matt (Cameroon) joined us 13 years ago, which is much longer than many groups exist.
First, I think we're still alive, and second, we're going to worry about others.
We are all very close friends and, as a result, have also opened up the musical roads that give each experiment freedom.
We trust each other's music, and things can't be better.
Your relationship with the word of glory was not easy, but thanks to your success, you were able to do what you wanted.
How do you find the balance?
When we grew up, it was easier to find a balance.
We're going to worry about not being too long in the tour because it's easy to fall into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people here are for music, it reminds you that you should respect music and what it has done, not deciding to be famous and rock star, which none of us will care about.
What do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we're writing really good songs and it was great at first.
We were in the group for almost three years and did not release any album, which led to the death of Andy Woods.
There was a lot of disappointment, because it took so long, and most important, that we still had close friends with Bruce (Ferveser) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the group, and when I heard a song or a photo, I think about the amazing man who was Andy, and how he made me laugh, always had the pleasure of going to work, laughing, talking about music and football and many others.
He was a remarkable man, and we're running after him.
The local group will be responsible for opening a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her to open it?
Yes, the forwarders sent us a few videos, and it was a group that liked us most, so we don't have to see that Las Robertas could offer a living, and that must be very impressive.
Why do you always change words in Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
That's the question of Eddie Wedder, so I don't know.
He's taking her, and I think he's using the first thing that comes to his head.
Who influenced you like the bus driver?
They're so many.
Among the first ones who come to mind, Giser Butler, John Entvisl, Si Jay Ramon, John Dou, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukovski...
I can talk to them so much that I can talk about the bassists I love all day.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the border's relevance despite the fact that he was no longer in fashion?
I think we're all feeling some embarrassment over the word of the border.
When I think about him, he reminds me of the groups I mentioned earlier, the type of Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that have appeared at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's great because it's music that should be heard, and the teams of the type Mudhoney are now creating music better than ever.
At first your music was darker, and now it was more positive.
How would you explain this change?
It's interesting, as I think, there are several songs in the album that can be said easier, but there are types of The End or Just Heart, which are considered very dark, although they may sound a little positive.
From both times when Ed was playing them, I cried when he heard them, these songs were very dark.
I think that when you grow up and there was some trauma in your life and you lost family members or others, these events begin to affect your creation and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect it to me.
So I think you can be a happy man and still be able to create dark music.
Peru:
Fuchimours were re-hospitalized for medical examination
The ex-President, Alberto Fuhimori, was hospitalized on Tuesday at a public hospital for a study on the loss of muscle strength that was observed in the legs, told his family doctor.
Fuchimours, 72, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffered several diseases, including language cancer, resulting from which he was four times monitored.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal doctor, told TV channel N that Fuhimori would be investigated within three days at the National Institute of Non-Platical Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of power in its lower ends.
Aginga said that, in his view, Fuchimori should be a candidate for the benefit of a pardon from humanitarian considerations; however, he said he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He transferred four operations into the language cancer, lost 18 pounds [18 kg] of other diseases, such as severe osteoporosis, gastric acids, back pain, high blood pressure, and bleeding problems, and listed the doctor.
Fuhimori has been in prison since September 2007, at the National Police Department of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 persons by the destruction forces of the army, which had been operating secretly in the first year of his reign.
Music is being sent to Mexico to strengthen political relations
The official delegation, headed by President Uruguay José Mukhiko and a number of ministers and businessmen, will come to Mexico this Tuesday with a visit to increase trade between the two countries and start negotiations on the political issues of the region.
The music will meet in the next environment with its Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderon, the most important part of the extensive plan to meet with political, commercial authorities and the community of surgeons living in Mexico, as described by Uruguay ' s leadership.
The meeting of the two Presidents in Guadalajara City will be “beneficiary for the exchange of information on political relations between two nations”, as the South American country's guidance on its website was published.
According to local media, Mukhika was supported by the Calderona for Uruguay in an incident with France, which occurred when French President Nicola Sarkozi included the South American country in the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Kanne.
In his speech, Sarkozi threatened to remove from the international community those countries remaining tax havens, a statement that prompted Uruguay's protest and a response to the consultations of his Ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20 group of the most highly developed and developing countries since November and has, in fact, with the South American country since January of this year, an agreement to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the conclusion of tax exchange agreements to abandon this “group list” of Economic Cooperation and Development Organization from countries that are not benefiting from international tax cooperation standards.
With regard to the Trade Plan, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 with regard to the Free Trade Agreement (STS), which has increased trade between the two countries.
The waterway will become three-foot with Super Mario 3D Land
Super Mario has fought continuously for more than 25 years to save Princess Pitch from the evil trap of Bouzer, but he has never done so in three dimensions: "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the love of girls in stereoscopic technology.
The publication, which will appear in stores all over the world this month, was created taking into account the characteristics of Nintendo 3DS Portal, which allows for three measurements without the use of glasses.
"Mario - a hero who should report how stereoscopy will work without glasses," said the head of Nintendo Press Service in Spain, Omar Alvares, at the time of the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first Nintendo video especially developed under this platform", because until now successful products like Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" have been adaptations to the existing game.
The representative of Nintendo stated that, despite the 3D existence of Super Mario 3D Land, the video was "achievable" that allows fast and mobile games to be enjoyed.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" had two games in one: the first part "simple" to attract less experienced users.
At one point, most experts will go “on the second round” at the level of games that are more complex in this time.
In addition, users can choose between "D aggressive" or which only affects the depth of action, but which should be played in three dimensions in order to overcome various obstacles and to “not give optical illusions”.
This super Mario entry in three dimensions also refers to the return of the hero to the Portal Consulate, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo is smiling at the fans of the series and repeats a successful formula from the previous game, and a guide with his teeth needs to walk through dangerous abandoned platforms to free Princess Pitch.
However, the game will discover new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as "player" Luigi.
Colombo guarantees Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Alvaro Colom said on Tuesday that the process of extradition of Alfonso Portillo had begun to respond to the United States for a loan of $70 million.
This is the end of the process in which Guatemala responded to the request of the northern country, which called for the extradition of Portugal to judge it there.
At the Colum press conference, he said his decision was related to the independence of the judiciary and executive authorities, bearing in mind that the court of the first instance had already signed extradition.
He claimed that during his mandate he did not “applied his hands” to legal decisions and took all the extradition procedures he had ever known.
With Puerto Rico, Sergio Ruano Marrokin will be excommunicated for murder and serious physical injuries, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug abuse.
What the Colima has done is an executive process after all legal and constitutional courts have been abolished in order to prosecute the head of the State from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CS), Portillo will be issued once with a decision on its legal status in Guatemala and the guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was recognized as innocent at the cost of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence during the presidential term, which was a process prior to extradition, but the Ministry of Public Relations has appealed and the case has been reopened.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people from the risk group
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of the Trinijove Social Support Organization are important: 6,000 young people under social isolation have been helped to overcome the complex situations during this fourth century.
More than a hundred jobs created for this social group should be purchased.
The anniversary was the result of a ceremony held in the old factory of Fabra I Coats, where more than 300 people arrived.
Trinijove appeared in the world in 1986 with the Trinity of Velya to help young people with lack of education, lack of work and problems with drugs or marginalization.
A large number of responsible organizations and institutions that have worked with the association during the past 25 years have been celebrated in Sant Andreu yesterday.
The different political representation during the elections showed the unique nature of the work done by Trinijove.
Following the President-in-Office of the Generality, Artura Mass and his predecessor, Hordy Puhl, attended the ceremony with the ex-consultant of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragol, and the former mayor and current eco-socialist, member of the municipal council of Richard Goma.
The current social welfare and family consultant, José Luis Cleris and SEO, also appeared in Fabra I Coats, La Caixa, Haume Lanaspa.
He said that Trinijove had appeared in the world at a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but added that the work done so far was “a good basis”.
The President cited Trinijove as an example of the fight against bad conditions and the full range of hopes in people facing difficulties.
"The crisis is not new to her organization and work," he said.
The captured building where mass festivals were organized was evacuated
The capturers occupied 11 of the 13 buildings on the Balms Street, 51
12 occupiers left the building yesterday morning without fighting
It seems that the nightmare of neighbors living in the house 51 on the street of Balms has come to an end.
Twelve people left the building they had illegally occupied yesterday and where they had organized mass dinners that destroyed their neighbors, to decide the court without interference from the police.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent the recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, there's going to be a transitional control here," said the manager.
Squatters, which had occupied 11 out of 13 buildings, the rest of the villages, took all electricity and part of the water, destroyed the walls and left traces of various kinds, particularly the alcohol-based banks.
The first three stages were a table for mass dinners that lasted for two days and destroyed the owners.
There is a night club, Balms 51, which was also damaged.
The governor, Maria Pantinet, reported that from the time the building was occupied, her income dropped by 80 per cent.
The owner of the club says that the owners of the building had taken her in an unfair way, as they sold drinks for three euros, and as in the club for 10.
Moreover, the discotheque owner had to be responsible for the complaints of neighbors on the noise, although she noted that noise was not caused by the club's visitors, but by the village's inhabitants and, above all, by those who visited the evenings organized there, the frequency and intensity of which increased, as alleged neighbors said.
The owner of the club said that the disadvantages were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and here it was nine months ago, as he "sold" her rent.
The city police also confirmed that over the past week, more complaints were received from neighbors in the situation.
The President of the PP municipal group, consultant Alberto Fernand Dias, called for the last week “to immediately evacuate the building in order to address the problems of the existence and common spirit of the neighbors and degradation in this area”.
The popular leader explained that only one such building had been occupied by the summer, but in the past few months, the shelters had been in all stages and virtually every room and some of them had been damaged.
In this sense, he added that “it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to stand firm against the culture of the building. ”
So yesterday, police members evacuated the building in New Barris.
At 15:30, the police went to Montreal Street, 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed how four people came into the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or forest?
Architects agree with the possibility of competition after the call for contributions
The 16-door municipal competition resumed the discussions on the role of Coliseum in Barcelona
In the mid-80th century, under the direction of the Barcelona Stock Exchange (SCB), this administration printed a promo-list for Kolserola.
Bucklet described the mountain as a large park of the capital of Barcelona.
Moreover, this was accompanied by a comparison in pictures with the New York Central Park.
With SKB's death in 1987, the park again took place in the knowledge of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that are located not in the south but up (up) to the sea.
The position of Coliseum as a natural park would contradict that idea.
The prototype was not the Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a beautiful cabin in the role of the Yoga bear.
That was so until, in September, the Council announced a huge competition of 16 competitions for many other rounds in Coliseum.
Under the walls, there is no doubt the idea of a park.
Either way, or someone who wants to put the door in the field.
The question is one: Colserola, park or mountain?
The meetings, their organizational part and their impact on the city are the subject of discussion by all the architects of Barcelona.
This is hardly the most repeating subject discussed when two members of this group of chosen people meet each other in the elevator.
This fact is one of the few similarities between the three architects of Barcelona and the scientists who were present.
Miguel Rolldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: co-operation
For Roldana, after the arrival of the border line, it would be necessary to consider "the first side of the mountain", when the proposal of Ildefon Serdi, a mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
"It must be admitted that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Besides, thanks to its excellent availability.
Colserole is more complex," says the architect for whom the title "Colserole Door" contains "a word stick": we should not think of them "how to enter the park, but how to limit some areas where we must act".
The model, like Roland and Bayona, with experience in urban construction, called the proposal "intellectual task" with "some dangers".
Risks arising from "uncertainty of public space forecasting" after the 80x experience, which ended at the forum of "his novelty song".
The first fear is the own limit of the border where you can build.
"Limiting something is the preparation of the next step," there is a shift.
“We need to think of new urban planning tools, as current [on the General Capital Plan] can lead to real disaster.”
Close to the case, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Coliseum valley “can be understood as a park, Barcelona, rather than as a purely topographic issue.
The module recalls that there is already work done outside Calserol, which “must not be missed at all”, although it is grateful for the opportunity that Mary has offered her profession to enter the project “from the very beginning”.
Moreover, he understood that the approach of the mountains to the city was a passage that allowed the architects to enter into the debate, but "he doubted" whether this technical profile was what should be led by interdisciplinary teams (the "success", he said), which should have been created: "the architects should be only a tool".
The Bayona points out that the answer to the question posed by the name of this part is complex, as the rules of the competition do not understand the general nature of Coliseum: "There have been 16 cross-border competitions, he says, for the sake of the sea, but there is no reasonable reading here to see and understand the area as a whole."
This, at least in his case, has led to 16 competitions.
On the other hand, the project for one roll can be broken down by the programme and the project of the architect for the next roll.
From your point of view, the Council is pleased to ensure that the fields directly above the Ronda de Dalt must be provided in its entire area equipped for the establishment of a river crossing between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonahs Larrasabal and he will be released
After 72 days of settlement, the representative of the Red Casino apologized to Mr. Monterrey's brother for the prosecution.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Yonos Larsabal will be released after the legal representative, Red Casino, granted him an apology before the Second Criminal District Court, which carries out the proceedings against the brother of Mr. Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, the owner of Red Casino, Serhio Gil Garcia, published a series of photos and videos where Manuel Jones asked him to pay for the economic contribution so that the Monterey authorities could authorize a secret operation in the game house.
After a public trial, the State Prosecutor-General opened a criminal case against the Brother of Mary, and on 2 September he was arrested and sentenced to 30 days in prison.
Four hours later, he was sent to a temporary prison in the old capital of the State.
He stayed there 49 days, following the provisions of the second ban on the transfer, after the prosecutor had removed the proceeds of the kidnapping and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Kadreyt for a half-billion-dollar pesos to the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in prison with the average isolation of prisoners because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue his detention in the municipal prison in San Nicolas in Garze.
On 25 October, the arrest order was issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yanes, who said that, after almost two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence of Jonah's guilt, such as the acquisition of 1.5 million pesos from the bookmakers in exchange for an operation.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo Garcia Gomez, presented to Judge José Luis Pesina to apologize to the mayor of the region, so that he could be released in the coming hours.
During the trial, the Public Prosecutor at the trial, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez if he had been injured and who of the gambling partners had been fined, even though the lawyer had tried not to make a name.
On the basis of the record of 197/2011, the legal mercy granted to Jonah Larrasabal was granted, and no statements on the process planned against him could be made; no damage and no punishment would be required.
Following the hearing of the legal representative of the bookmaker, almost 15:50, it was ordered immediately to release Larsabal Breton.
The serving court, Jorge Yanes, was sent to San Nicolas Prison in Garz to tell Jonah that he was legally forgiven and that his case would be closed.
He will also inform him of the immediate order for release signed by the judge.
Minister Dionysio Peres Hacome tells of the disaster where the Minister of Internal Affairs, Francisco Blake, and seven others were killed.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MST) reported that the results of the accident during which the Minister of Internal Affairs of Francisco Blake Mora and seven others were killed showed that the helicopter hit the ground directly in full compliance without the pilot's attempt to cause an accident.
During the press conference, Dionysio Peres Hacome, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft was above, the pilot had found that the weather conditions were suitable for flight.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the vessel had several contact with land have been contacted with trees at 25 metres, where the vehicle has lost its flag."
He also reported that the ship was intended for 19 persons, respectively, in accordance with the requirements for the carriage of persons.
He also said that studies in the affected area did not report the presence of particles on the ground.
"The study reported that in another location no components of the ship had been hit in structural integrity.
"The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which met the relevant passenger transport requirements.
The earth here has a depth of from seven to 30 degrees.
At this point, the Secretary said, mainly, to obtain results as soon as possible; however, the study may take a few months or even one year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto Lopes Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Support Services, said that during a presidential helicopter strike, it was over at the Creiser speed and that it was on the soft ground.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of the usual summer maneuver at the moment of the strike," he said.
At the press conference, the owner of SCT, Peres Hacome, listed six important elements in the survey:
_Visual flight:
According to flight rules, the flight was carried out according to the visual flight rules, which meant that the teams should have visibility during flight and land.
Suitable conditions:
The AICM reports identified the appropriate conditions for landing when the aircraft was sent to the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico where the layers of clouds were observed at low altitudes.
Selected paths:
The team may have sought the area of less altitude and greater visibility in the Kurnavac Valley because of the weather conditions.
The place hits.
The coordinates of the strike and the latest records from the aircraft's radar are likely to not have been lost before the attack.
Scattering of small spaces:
The information available at the same time indicates that the attack has taken place on the front and side lines.
The dispersion of the clouds makes it clear that the helicopter has been confronted with land under structural integrity.
No signs of fire or explosion have been detected:
In the disaster zone, there is no evidence found in the ship's shells, some kind of explosion or fire.
The results of recent studies show that there could be multiple contact with the land.
At the time of work on the ground, the aircraft was found at a height of 9,200 feet above sea level, with a depth of from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The photos show the consistency in which it was broken down.
The information contains facts that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have several contact points from the ground.
After a thorough investigation into more territory than the area covered by the disaster site, no fragmented parts of the aircraft were found, which reinforces the assumption that an attack had occurred under structural integrity.
MSS announces the ageing gene search programme
Social protection leads to a study on the search for the gene of life for children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute for Social Protection (MSSI) announced that a study is being conducted with the aim of identifying the gene of pregnancy in children and young people, which has received the name of the protocol “Genetics of pregnancy in children and adolescents”, which will provide support for signs related to excessive weight.
In his statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the 21st century Miguel Cruz Lopez explained that a multiprofessional team of therapists, nurses, dietists and social workers had been gathered.
The team is assisted by the National Institute for National Health (NIPH) and the Centre for Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
The study invited the population (proscribed or not) to participate in the MSSI sports centres participating in the study, in the valley of Mexico, where every Saturday, at 8:00 a.m., tests will be conducted with children.
He stressed that the protocol had begun to be sent to the sports centre in Kuwait (in the west of Mexico) and, on 8 October, the activities were held at the sports centre in Nassaualkotolle (in the east of Mexico).
After the goal of attracting 500 to 600 children, the study continues at the Sports Centre of Independence (South Mexico) and, finally, at the Morelos Sports Centre (Northern Mexico).
He explained that the purpose of this study was to understand the composition and importance of genetics in the development of ageing and to identify the risk factors among children and young Mexicans to prevent chronic deorientative diseases.
The World Day for Combating Diabetes will be noted on 14 November, and the main goal is to gather three thousand children and adolescents from 6 to 14 years of age from the age of parents and under their supervision to fill individual food allowances.
They will also be asked about physical activity and about the history of family inherited diseases to avoid risk factors such as diabetes or early disability.
He explained that the anthropometric measurements would be carried out on Saturday for all participants (birth, growth and density), blood pressure and blood pressure levels of glucose, fats, cholesterol and insulin and genetic analysis (to identify genes related to childhood).
Crus Lopez said that this study reflected the concern of health professionals about the worrying increase in weight among children.
Medical studies from 1999 to 2006 suggest that there has been an increase of 77 per cent for boys, 47 per cent for girls, and that there has been a significant increase here," said MSSI expert.
He said that the rationale of the search for markers was based on the fact that the people of the country were different from other peoples in their genetic history.
He noted that the average Mexico is 65 per cent of the descendants of the American Indians, 30 per cent of the Europeans and five per cent of the Africans, and this condition was reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
He explained that the main result of the generating genetics is the inability of the body to absorb the energy we consume (calorie) and to release it in the form of iron.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants was a comprehensive assessment of children, which could determine whether they had any degree of weight or maturity.
In fact, he said that there were dark deposits on the tea (cattles) and advantages meant that metabolism was likely and even prediabetes.
Information is provided with all confidentiality, and the doctor transmits it in writing to parents, who explain all the measurements and changes in the way of life that must be taken to avoid diseases.
Crus Lopes explained that there are three main causes of excessive weight, aging and other chronic diseases: living conditions, or lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day in front of the TV and transport in small places instead of walking.
This is also due to high calorie consumption, which is also the increase in the use of soft drinks and hydrocarbons (tables, bread, pizzas, hamburgers, etc.) with the high content of fats and proteins and genetics analysed in this programme.
Asphalt UNAM is able to avoid thirds
Raphael Errera, a researcher at the UNAM Chemicals College, developed a polymer modified bitumen to produce a mixture of the best quality, consistent with the environmental and temperature impact.
If the signals sent by road coverage were to be taken into account, it would be necessary to reassessed about 200 thousand meals per year in the capital area of the Gulf of Mexico, says Raphael Errera Naher, a researcher at the UNAM chemical college, and adds that if the construction and maintenance of the standardized road coverage process is correct, the number of them may be reduced or all transferred to zero.
In his lecture, the technological insight into the irons read in the International Year of Chemicals reports that the laboratory for which it is responsible develops a polymer-modified bitumen for the production of mixtures with the characteristics of near-bit but better resistance to both high and low temperatures.
Errera Naher said that this type of modified bitumen could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as in some cities in the north to improve the quality of the road and thus to counter education.
He explained that the most difficult part of the oil is the sequence of carbon molecules, some of the high molecular mass called asphalts, and others of the low molecular mass of what are called malts, which together contribute to the path cover of its characteristic interpolar behavior.
The related behavior of the bitumen is that it behaves at about 180 degrees at high temperatures, as liquidity, at 120 degrees, and at 50 degrees at Celsius, while at very low temperatures it is weak, he said.
This means that the resistance to street asphalt is not constant but changes over the course of the day, depending on the natural conditions and temperature, said a chemical engineer.
The scientific Himphaca noted that the streets of Mexico are mainly covered by flexible coverings made up of six layers of material, three of which are made up of bitumen.
Among the top layers is a beat consisting of small stones cast into the beat and then pressed.
Every stone that makes up this roof, he said it's loaded in a bit.
The movement of vehicles and the exercise of efforts will help the forces to be well distributed on the road.
If it were a modified asphalt, they'd be better distributed, the chemical engineer would say.
On the asphalt cover, he added the last layer, called a layer of exports made from a small stone, actually a sand that was also loaded into the asphalt.
As this is the layer that will be contacted with the vehicles, it must have more resistance than asphalt coverage and road traffic.
As part of the road cover that will be received and distributed, the burden of exports also requires proper weight and should be taken into account the materials it produces.
The weather, particularly humidity and temperature fluctuations, are also very important factors for the consideration, especially water, he said, because it has a significant impact on asphalt.
When the soil is raw, the water flows through and it is difficult to get out of there, it causes all the layers of cover to cool down and thus educate it.
In the course of food education, he said that the first issue was the burden of exports, and only then it affected the battle, but the damage was not sudden, which should be given attention to the first signs of the current repairs programme.
The member of the National System of Researchers also explained that the load of transport is another important factor in the education of the race, and therefore the load of each layer must always be linked to the load of transport and must ensure that this requirement is met in order to prevent frequent exposure to it.
Rafael Errera said that there is still much to study and do, for example, by-product emulsions that are already on the market in other countries and even help make them easy and without high temperatures.
Why didn't the candidate come from Vale to become a new Miss Colombia?
An analysis of the reasons why Sir Meline Ramires had interfered with receiving the crown of Ms. Colombia.
The representative of Vale received the title of the princess 14 times.
On a regular basis, Valé del Cauca only wanted to acquire the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramires Serena had to be satisfied that she had fallen on the floor of the winners with a silver crown and a penthouse announcing her new princess, Colombia.
In view of the results achieved last evening in Cartagena, where Ms. Atlantic won the crown and the skipper, the department is composed of 14 titled princesses, and Melina joins the legion of women from Valé del Cauca, who were close to the crown, but were announced by the princess, among them Mirías Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Dominüh (1949), Patricia Bellina Ayla (1979), Laurena Alvares (1981), Rose Marie Alsate (1983), Olga Blance (1987), Monica White (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Sonya Suns (Sunsula) and Rosa (1990)
The question that many now ask is:
Because the result is the expression of the main favour, which has been shown in each of the statements that it has all to become a new Miss Colombia, not only has it been selected by the Royal Police and the most beautiful person on the Vogue version of the title that the Queens, such as Tatian Vargas or Natalie Navarro, have received from Miss Colombia.
The first factor that played a role in the decision of the jury to condemn the title of the First Princess was that she was not able to answer the question "What book characterizes you, and why did Martin Muriel Gomez read from the literature society of David.
She answered the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of culture, and I definitely think that a book that characterizes my childhood is a little prince.
Today, I read “Retribution and Punishment”, which is the title of world literature that we should all read; I also now read the book Irina Nemirous, Russian writer, a wonderful book called the Fire of Blood.
An answer that did not interest Jews because of the term "culturalization" and, secondly, because it did not explain specifically how each of the procrastinated books characterizes it.
But after Melina's ceremony, she said that she was calm and satisfied with her result: "The wisdom of the universe is what must happen."
And all of you please read a little little little little little little little little prince is a big book.
Among the popular hypotheses, Vale burned out of favorism.
The reporter from Bogotá suggested that, as she was preferred, she had met with objections, and she was a candidate who received all the preliminary awards (culinary competition of Ostera, a national best-known vote, and the Queen-Matta), "which aroused the zeal of other candidates, caused the king's stress, and as a result she did not stumble at the stage".
This was noted during her first appearance in the hall on the Hillton beach and during her two exhibitions on the evening corridor.
Although it was evident in both appearances, it was noted that it did not have the strength and energy displayed by the representatives of Magdalena and Atlanta.
Ariel Osario, a journalist on the RCN channel, said that the fact that Milan was called a princess means that a candidate who wins more prize in the course of the contest will not become a king.
In addition, the representative of Valé has recently been avoiding the press community and this has been wrong.
The second hypothesis is that the representative of Valé has failed to convince the jury in his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Contest of Krasot.
That is why, two days before the election of an international jury member, Lucy Dotty said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of her country.
"One beauty is not enough for Ms. Colombia, we must look not only at the outside but also focus on public awareness, before they participate in the competition, they must be involved in the projects," she said.
It is also suggested that the representative of Vale has made mistakes in the deficiencies of the eggs and the fibrosis that have been seen in her life, but this is controversial, as the jury noted her as a "natural beauty" candidate, taking into account her healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
The advice of King Jorge Ernan Orosco notes that Melina had no better body than they had, "but the problem of fibrosis in my life, which has not been very noticeable to me, has caused her to lose eyes in the last day."
In addition, journalist Guido Oios, from Cromos magazine, believes that the error of the representative of Valé de Kauka was that she was subjected to surgical intervention.
"The operations are good, but the representative of Vale doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
With regard to the prize that was awarded to the organizers of the National Competition for Beauty, the worst forecast came last night, saying that it was the child that Raymondo gave Melina as a compensation for her lack of the satisfaction of receiving the crown.
This or not, the fact that Melina is now beginning the year of rule, not as queens, but as a princess, the position that enables her to present Colombia to one of the international competitions indicated directly by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, it will go into history as one of the kings, who, despite his opening speech at the Cartagena competition, faced difficulties in obtaining crowns.
That's the kind of man's job that knew the body of Alfonso Cano.
A Kali criminal went through history as a man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officers is key.
On 4 November CTI Kali went into history as a man who confirmed the identity of the head of FARC Alfonso Cano on his fingerprints.
Of the seven criminals working in the CTI, this week, someone from Puerto Tehad, who had been conducting 21 years of judicial investigation, was forced to “get away” by Elizar Gonzalez.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in the cities of Ccho, where he often had to try more than five days through the jungle to reach places where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valé, and after completing his courses, he became a criminal specialist, where he studied skin training, i.e. ladens and stunas.
During the week of the man-to-man operation of Eliezer, known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to wear no more than three days.
Something big was coming up.
On Friday night, he arrived at the port of Kauka in Palmir.
He knew that he would have to meet two troops, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the oldest part of the world's party war, so they asked him to take ten photographs of the impressions of Gilermo Leona Saens (his name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the place where the body was located, he did not recognize him outside; he was very different from what was shown in the media.
He was without fights, dressed like a local farmer, without shoes and a lot of shoes.
But prints don't red.
Using a large glass, a black box, a box, and a phonograph, Eliezer compared the prints of the group’s fingers to those on the picture.
His eyes didn't show up: it was Alfonso Cano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerto Tehad asked Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinson to confirm that he was the head of the RVSC.
Search for fingerprints
The recognition received by President Huana Manuel Santos Elisar Gonzalez at the press conference on Operation against Cano was particularly significant for a dactiloscopy specialist from Sijin from Kali.
Many people don't know what we're doing.
Dactyloscope is a hard science, without a mistake, it can play a key role in the detection of crimes.
In addition to the identification of the body, doctiloscopes participate in investigation of crimes such as theft and murder and establish the identity of detainees.
When arrested, many of the criminals had or did not have documents.
We'll take their prints and find them in the base.
The researcher said that in the event of the theft, he had to bring a piece of the wall home because the door was made by hands to hold a safe, complete treasure and money.
“It is difficult to work with walls because they are not easy surfaces to remove prints, but in this case we can take photos of the whole floor and establish the identity of the criminal who participated in several thefts,” he said.
Printing also helps to exclude or establish the participation of suspects in murder cases.
A dead man was recently found with bottles from under the elevator around him.
The investigation found that a relative could be suspected of committing a crime and that, in fact, fingerprints on the buttons had been dropped.
Although this does not guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was at the murder site.
A CTI doctiloscopic specialist explained that a chemical or physical reaction is present at the place where there are prints.
When they appear, they use a ball or a tape to remove them.
Thereafter, prints are sent to Asif, which is the database of criminals, or are registered.
"The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians," said CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as indicated in the CSI TV programme.
Just like not all the gold that shines, not all that you pull, leaves prints on you.
However, if possible, comparisons are made.
"Disgusted people" challenge the authorities of New York
Hundreds of protestors broke the camp before the Zucketti Square.
Some of the protestors listened to the court's decision to disrupt the demonstration from the platform and were sent to a nearby park.
The members of the "Taking Wall Street" set out on Tuesday challenges to the authorities in New York, when they tried to find out again, under the court order, at Manhattan Square, where they were evacuated to light when they were trying to capture another park of the Big Yablok.
Hundreds of protestors fled to the Zucotti Square, where they wanted to escape through a court order that allowed the "disgusting people" camp to be broken down until the other part of the movement responded to the raid, captured the park in the north of the city, where further arrests were held
"Our idea is that once the court does not allow us to break the camp on the floor, we will break the camp somewhere else and continue the judicial struggle to return to Succoth and through peaceful arrests and demonstrations," said one of the representatives of the "Take Wall Street" movement Mark Bree.
Bree explained that the “disgusted people” response to the evacuation of the palace city, which was ordered by Mr. New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the court where Judge Lucy Billings issued a decree prohibiting forced eviction from the camp and allowing demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, the "disgusted people" began to capture a new park located on the central streets of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Netherlands tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by the Church of Trinity.
At least for an hour they could take this place, but then the police arrived and began arresting some of the protesters, although Bree could not call the exact number, but Efe said that he saw several journalists who were also in the hands.
The organization is convinced that several hundred people stood with the parliaments in a place where the delegation of religious leaders sent out to demonstrate support for the members of the movement, trying to act as a mediator in the negotiations with the police.
In the meantime, the area of Zucotti, which is private, remains closed in waiting for a hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, which will consider the legality of today's morning dispute of protesters.
Some of the protestors sent there carried and distributed copies of the judgment at the same time and even handed these copies to police guards, which led to “some small meetings”, said Bree, who said that some police were demonstrators.
The judicial decision prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of the “Take Wall Street” movement and imposes upon them “laws issued after the beginning of the arrest, or prohibits demonstrators from accessing the park with stores and other property used earlier”.
Mr. Bloomberg told the reporters that, as a result of this order, the city's court had stopped opening public space and the demonstrators had been informed about it, but local laws did not allow them to re-open the palace stores and bedrooms.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of protestors from the Zucotti area, conducted in the light, during which some 200 arrests were committed, and the decision was taken because the protestors “were in violation of the law”.
Bloomberg said that he gave the order to clean the area because it became “a place where people came not to protest, but to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm others”, as well as “some businesses were threatened” and neighbors were afraid of “a loss of quality of life”.
The evacuation that took place this morning was disgusting and showed that Bloomberg's soul was more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers, the representative of the movement, who condemned the mayor for “unrespect of freedom of speech”.
Those responsible for the "Taking Wall Street" also indicated that they were planning to organize "grandial actions" on Thursday, in collaboration with public organizations and trade unions, in order to remember the last two months of protests that began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will become Devo Maria at a special birth TV show
Together with Michael Bubelle and other prominent Canadians, it will appear on the television program “Rassela Peters” on 1 December.
Canada Pamela Anderson was a assistant to Tim Allen in the Great Remont, a rescuer in the "Savior of Malibu", Banni in the Pleiboe, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will become Devo Maria at a special birth show on Canadian television.
The partial CTV TV announced today that Anderson, along with the crowner (equivalent ballad) Michael Bubelle and other outgoing Canadians, will appear in the “Rassela Peters” television program on 1 December, in the role of a very special Maria.
CTV presented today a television show in which Anderson, also known for its wide-ranging home pornography video on the Internet, depicting it together with his then husband, Mötley Crée, a drummer group named Tommy Lee, appeared in a dress like Deva Maria, who is in a small corner depicting Jesus.
In this scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comec of Indian origin, recently described as the leader of the "My Cruel Treach of Truth" tour, appears in the role of Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the Canadian poet Boble, who eventually married in Buenos Aires on the Argentine model Luisian Lopilato, also knows so much about the scandals.
Bubble recently called American Kim Cardageyan during one of his concerts in New York
Japan born after the earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5 per cent through domestic consumption and ended the drop rate that started in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and has been relieved of the devastating earthquake caused by the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that has been experienced by the Eastern Party since World War II.
According to the Government of Tokyo's first assessment, material losses amounted to $300 million, which, despite the heavy world situation, was likely to occur.
Following the three loss quarters, data on the gross domestic product from July to September have definitely helped turn the page: GDP increases by 1.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter and 6 per cent per year.
The second quarter - for Japanese financial year begins in March 2012 - also offsets the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The generation may be partly due to the repurchasing of the purchase of machinery for the restoration of areas that have been destroyed by earthquakes and followed by tsunamis.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1 per cent against a reduction of 0.9 per cent of capital costs, which was observed from January to March, the first reduction after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real surplus in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the casino impulse, which calls for a crisis to strengthen or restructure infrastructure, using bugs to grow from zero.
Japan has woke up, mainly due to the development of household consumption, which now accounts for 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.
This figure increased by 1 per cent by increasing car costs, travel and rest.
Clymo yen
Tokyo provided the internal market when it became a Japanese currency - one of the "valuables" selected investors who wanted to escape from the debt crisis in the euro area and negative forecasts about the US, a privilege that would be given as a stone to the company exporters' accounts.
The higher cost of road production is outside the country's borders, which is a serious blow to countries whose economic course is determined by the health of large technological companies.
Soyota or Sonny, for example, blames each other in their low rates from July to September.
As long as markets continue to remain in the EU's peripheral countries, the Government of Esikhiko Noda does not reduce caution.
We should be aware of the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the sharp increase in value of Iran, said the Minister for Economic Policy Motohis Furukava yesterday.
In fact, prospects are not inspiring.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most States parties had demonstrated clear signs of economic activity in September.
The indicator predicting global economic changes showed that major forces are slowing down.
It then fell to four tenths to 100.4 paragraphs, compared to 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone even fell below the average value of 100 paragraphs after it violated eight decades to 99.13 paragraphs.
Afins once again give soil to doubt
The appellants said that the correction would be approved, but the conservators would not sign any written obligations
With peripheral risk premiums and uncertainty surrounding the parks, Greece continues to go mad at the maze, which leads to a major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “agreement” of the new Transitional Government of Ellade is more binding than Brussels’s requirements, unless it is true of political forces, begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While new Prime Minister Lucas Papalimos warned yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the period agreed upon by his appointment might be insufficient for their use, the leader of the New Democracy Conservative Party, Antonis Samaras, assured that no new measures would be supported by the strict economy in any case and repeated his request for new elections on 19 February.
The Government ' s main task is to implement the decisions adopted at the summit on 26 October, which were made yesterday by opening parliamentary debates, which were hosted by the new executive authority's full confidence tomorrow.
A package of 24 programmes for increasing the employment of the population, reform of the Disciplinary Code of Public Servants and new measures to combat tax-reduction will be the first update.
However, the message of Samaria does not explain any doubt as to its position: “We are ready to help the Transitional Government, but we do not promise anything.”
The leader of the conservatives has taken a step further in their attitudes towards the EU and IMF, organizations that need 8,000 million urgently needed Athens, and has explained that he will not grant his approval any letter of agreement.
But the European Commission, still testing the effect of the statement made by the referendum of Papandreu in the form of anything or anything, reiterated yesterday that its requirements were unique: it would not resume aid if the new Government and the leaders of the major parties of Greece did not sign “a written agreement without any doubt and as soon as possible”.
The representative of the Ministry of Economy of Amadeu Altafai said that the three inspectors could "be back to Athens very soon" to discuss with the new Government what should be done to pay for the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, although the exact date is not yet marked.
In the Greek club, it's been a bit of a while.
Ms. Sofia: "These tools for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "main" place of Spain for this type of finance
Spain “has taken a visible place in the world in microfinance”.
King Sofia recalled yesterday that over the last two decades, the country has become the second donor to the instruments of cooperation, which she said, is that it is “a tool of social progress, justice and hope for the best future of all humanity based on faith in men”.
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valyade, with the belief that “there is no doubt” that such actions are “perfectly necessary” to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015, and “especially with a view to reducing the number of people living less than one dollar a day, the level of poverty.
Spain ' s " still working" to expand the network of recipients around the world and take on this task with all "responsibility", says Sofia's daughter, and hopes that the efforts and achievements of the summit that will continue until fourth is “to provide for the creation of new capacities and opportunities for the poorest people, especially for women, “the principal beneficiaries of these cases”.
There are "a lot of achievements" and "a lot of difficulties we're facing".
The microcredit summit is not only a platform for disputes but also a platform that contributes to “two main objectives”.
Thus, Her Majesty explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services and that one hundred million of these households would be deprived of the poverty they were experiencing.
The call for the establishment of a microcredit system in Spain and throughout the rest of the world "passed along the way, starting years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Ms. Sofia as "the Act of Justice and Recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as a “presumptuous idealist in the overall fight against poverty”, whose work was known for 15 years, since the king was sent to Bangladesh to study his credit policy.
This experience later this year was transferred to the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "I have seen continuous development everywhere," said Her Majesty, whose connection with this project had brought to her the title of "family heads", which was gathered in Valyadolid's "banker of the poor".
Finally, the King of Sofia concluded a statement calling on the participants to participate in the discussion and to take decisions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Empire"
Minister for Foreign Affairs Trinidad Hymenes said solidarity was “a ethical imperative” for each democratic State.
In this regard, she said that it would be wrong to link cooperation with developing countries with economic time, such as “permanent obligation”.
Hymenaeus concluded that microcredit was a “serious and firm course towards poverty eradication” and now “more than ever” of the Governments of developed countries should work in line with the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to become a victim of cost reduction.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of development cooperation”.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soria Rodríguez, highly appreciated the “performance” to give people the "confidential" "dedicated before which all doors are closed", and Mr. Valyadododa Francisco Haveir Leon de la Riva welcomed all those in the city who “opens its doors, covered by a spirit of solidarity”.
HDS proposes to elect the President of the Euro Commission by a general vote
The first day of the Christian-Democratic Union Congress (LDC) held in Leipzig on Monday, 14 November, was without major problems for Angel Merkel, who was also president of the Christian-Democratic Party.
The future of Europe has not been planned in a significant way, but it has become the same thing, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that government policies are not as strict as they should be today as Greece is and possibly Italy tomorrow....
The draft resolution on the Presidency of the European Commission, delivered under discussion, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained from the vote.
The arrests continued for a few minutes, which were deserved by Angel Merkel, and a few hours later, Wolfgang Schowble, the Eurofil and the Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is to be expressed in the horizon: a genuine response to the crisis - not less Europe but more Europe.
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "9 million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, it's time for a break in Europe.
This may mean changes in the Lisbon Treaty, which may enhance the control of the European Union over the financial policy of the Eurozone countries, but it may also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by a general vote, "to give a European person".
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by the Congress, which is obviously the subject of Wolfgang Schyoble.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will agree with this decision quickly; Britain is against this, and HDS leaders believe that Nicola Sarkozi is against it too.
But the soil is ready.
Similarly, the overwhelming majority rejected the proposal to raise the voice of each member of the European Union in the government of the European Central Bank in accordance with the size of each of them, which would significantly increase the volume of the German economy.
Wanting to ease the situation in his party, the Chancellor increased the number of references to Conrad Adenaure and Helmut Kolya, but she did not attempt to influence the Congress by means of "small" European countries or countries in a difficult situation who would like to criticize "high-end" Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe referred to the importance of "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
It's just a mummy.
I remember two centuries ago, Leipzig became a blood battle scene.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating attacks of the Napoleonian army.
What's this nonsense with the hospital letters?
Following financial benefits, UMPs and the Government began to receive hospital letters.
On 15 November, Nicola Sarcosi would come to Bordo to visit the Family Benefit Sharing Fund and to address the question that has been periodically raised since 2007 on combating fraud in the field of social benefits.
And in order to help this event, which has emerged from a difficult situation, but which is also part of the campaign on the right to re-election in presidential elections, most would like to focus on hospital papers.
Firstly, in terms of the budget economy, the Government intends to bind private companies on the fourth day of unpaid leave before payment of benefits.
It is evident that, without special consent from the employer, the sick worker loses his salary for four days, at least 15 per cent of his/her monthly income.
A measure that threatens the birth of a storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echos, leads to the economy of 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, i.e. to impose on public servants one day without payment of sickness benefits (State servants have not yet had to wait for benefits other than for a three-day period in the private sector).
Now, when these issues are discussed, the majority also raise the subject of fraud, with a view to abuse of medical records.
The control will become more sensitive and additional if you are caught, you will have to return all the payments you have illegally received," Ksavie Bertran on the RTL channel on Saturday, 13 November.
As in other cases, the effect of the statement has been a number of unreasonably real abuses with medical records.
They have indeed been subjected to constant control and political attacks that have produced their fruits since 2002.
People in France suffer no more than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's first look at the numbers on the country.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), over EUR 237 million of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Studies and Documentation, daily compensation costs in 2008 amounted to EUR 11.3 billion, 5 per cent of total health costs.
Of this amount, 46 per cent were affected by the decree and accidents in production and 54 per cent by the disease benefit, amounting to EUR 6.2 billion.
As a result, 2.5 per cent of health-related costs were incurred.
The French conducted a hospital on the average of 14.5 days in 2010 compared with 17.8 days in 2009, according to the Alma Consulting Group.
The average arithmetic, covering some deviations; another study published in 2007 on the Monster.com career management site showed that 75 per cent of French employees surveyed said that they had not taken one day of the hospital.
Another study on health insurance this time found that 37 per cent of patients were under 8 days, 15 per cent of 15 days a month, 15 per cent of one to three months, and 11 per cent were below.
When comparing these figures with the figures of European neighbours, it is clear that French workers are not more inclined to take care of the hospital than those of any other country.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001 the overall proportion of unemployment in France (health or health reasons) was between 10 and 11 per cent, compared with 20 to 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16-18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The level of fraud associated with hospital letters is very low compared to the "serious" job.
With regard to the level of obesity, he's very low.
The violation of the law after 2002 resulted in a systematic examination of hospitals for more than 45 days.
In 2008, of the 1.5 million cases examined, CNAM found that 13 per cent of the 285,000 short-term disease conclusions were "unreasonable" or too long", consisting of 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked hospital letters over 45 days, 11 per cent of the 1.2 million cases were "unplaceable or unreasonable", equivalent to 132 000.
In general, 169,000 cases were “unreasonable” to several million workers who received hospital letters.
The figures that show very few cases, for example, are “serious” figures of employment.
According to UMP Dominica Tiana, author of the report on this issue in June, they constitute 9 to 15 billion euros of unencumbered budget income per year, which exceeds the total daily compensation costs, and thus, inevitably higher than the loss of interest.
Assets: Greece should follow a new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement programme to save its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, in parliament, Prime Minister Lucas Papalimos added that 100 days of his coalition Government had not been sufficient to fulfil this task.
“To achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and the new budget adjustment programme,” said the Head of Government, who made his first public statement, opening up a debate on common confidence in parliament in the environment.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October must be the " main task" of the new Government, as the country ' s presence in Eurozone ' s presence ' is "described" has been added.
Accordingly, Fallas estimates a reduction of the country's budget deficit “about 9 per cent” from GDP to the end of the year, at 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
Rights reject the measures of the new Government
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the rights, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional measures of the strict economy.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with the MPs from his New Democracy Party.
He expressed his agreement with the objectives of reducing deficits and debt and combating spending, but also his rejection of any course that impedes the recovery of the economy.
Olly Renu, the European Commissioner responsible for the economy and finance, who warned that IMF and the EU would not block the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without written guarantees from all parties, that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
The Committee of Experts should legislate euthanasia and suicide with external assistance
Canadians refuse to die, as stated in the report of the Canadian Royal Society
With regard to palliative medicine, the Committee argues that the Government, health institutions and doctors work together to provide the best palliative assistance, which is not considered to be cancer.
The Canadians refuse to die.
Only 9 per cent of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in this direction.
This is one of the conclusions of the impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, which included six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the criminal code so as to permit suicide with foreign aid and euthanasia when this election is subject to circumstances and the patient may be considered competent for such a decision.
For the first time, experts referred to a recent study of the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared death in 40 countries of the world.
Although Canada is located in 10 places, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has given birth to a culture in which people fear to dispute the subject of death”.
Medicalization or not, but 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative assistance, inform experts appointed by the Royal Canadian society.
And 68.6 percent of them end up dying in the hospital.
The highest rate in Quebec, where 86 per cent of deaths occur in the hospital.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and suicide with external assistance, the authors of the report come up with a conclusion that contradicts the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code with regard to euthanasia and suicide with foreign aid.
Now, according to experts who have also studied the position of all countries where such actions have been legalized or demarinated, there is no evidence that such demining would lead to abuse in practice, that is, the implementation of euthanasia or suicide with external assistance to persons who cannot or do not wish to take such a decision.
On the contrary, he confirmed during a teleconference by Joselin Dunni, who reported that most of these cases were in countries where Afghanistan and suicide were not legalized with foreign aid.
Estonia is practiced in Canada, where it is obviously illegal.
Self-sustainment with foreign aid is practiced in Canada, where it is apparently illegal, explains Joselin Dunny.
Utah Canadians
It should be remembered that 85 per cent of Canadians speak for euthanasia because, according to Angus Reida's 2010 survey, they believe that this will allow people to end their suffering.
66% believe that the legislation of Afghanistan will not be a sign that the lives of elderly people or persons with disabilities are less valuable.
With regard to people who have assisted in suicide, 41 per cent of the respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care for the sick, the situation is less specific, the authors of the report are speaking.
They also propose, in addition to their other recommendations, that the criminal code should establish that legal cessation of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals learn in a spirit of respect to refuse medical care at the end of life without fear of criminal prosecution.
With regard to palliative assistance, the Committee calls on the Government, health care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best of palliative assistance, not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to the palliative or terminal session already widely used in the Canadian health institutions, the Committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve to alleviate physical pain, such as euthanasia, and subject to the same restrictions.
Comments by other experts
Some health-related legal experts have already made comments on the conclusion of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Metre Pierre Deshan, a health law expert, described the position of experts who signed the report, in particular, that it did not limit the use of euthanasia in death cases.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who has been living and who is more than 18 years old can ask for help in committing suicide, says metr. Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Metre Deshham also stressed that the authors of the report appear to be self-independence over all other values that constitute social fabric.
He said, "There are warning signs and prohibitions in society."
A health law specialist, Margaret Somerville, also said that the report she referred to as "manifest for euthanasia" was a "categorical disagreement with the conclusions of the report.
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, argues, in particular, the reports on abuses in some countries, where euthanasia and suicide are legalized with foreign aid, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan invites President Asada to exercise his power
Damascus condemns the "response"
Syria is in greater isolation
The members of the Basara Asada held a demonstration yesterday before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday a diplomatic pressure was put on Syria by Basara Asad, who, with Russia's support, was opposed and condemned as a “contract” against his country.
Two days after the withdrawal of the membership of Syria in the League of Arab States, the European Union imposed sanctions on Damascus and the neighbours of Syria, Turkey and Jordan, expressed their resignation to the President of Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday became the first Arab leader to appeal to President Basar Asad to power in Syria, where more than half of the civilians and servants of the armed regime were killed.
"If the interests of his country were to be taken away for Barak, he should be dismissed, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, said the king of Jordan, a neighbor of Syria, to the BBC.
In turn, the Foreign Minister of Turkey, Ahmed Davutoglu, regretted that the media efforts of Turkey, which began early this year, had not been successful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their aspirations lose their power, he said, referring to Syria, the neighbouring country with which Turkey is taking a more severe course.
On the other hand, the United States welcomes the “improvement of consensus against Asad and the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, and such countries as Turkey, have taken a more intensive course in relation to repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, representative of the State Department.
At the same time, 16 civilians and at least 19 representatives of the armed forces have been killed in the region of Dura in southern Syria, reports the Syrian Human Rights Observer (OSDH).
Two other residents were killed during the shooting and shot by heavy bombers in Jobara in the inhabited city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During the press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Valid Muallem said that the country was approaching the end of the crisis."
He also reacted strongly to the decision of the League of Arab States to remove Damascus, which, he said, was a “dangerous step”.
Syria will not be broken, he added, and he was certain that this promise against Syria would fail.”
Following its decision to remove Syria from the League of Arab States, he is currently studying “the mechanism for the protection of civilians and calls for the exploitation of 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, journalists and military observers in the country.
The Foreign Minister of France, Alan Juppe, also called for UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which, he said, has fallen into “parano” .
A new emergency meeting of the League was scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabath to discuss the implementation of the exit plan adopted on 2 November and providing, in particular, for the withdrawal of armed forces from the cities where the fighting took place and the release of arrested protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov referred to the “illegal” solution of the League of Arab States yesterday, while China called on Syria to implement a crisis exit plan, but refused to support possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty needs time in the Italian markets and victims
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for some time to form their team and to implement the programme that would require the victim to restore the credit capacity lost in the last few months of the Berlin government.
The former European Commissioner participated yesterday in discussions with political parties prior to today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
It must form a relatively moderate cabinet consisting of non-members of parliament.
Monty spoke of the importance of the programme of many victims, said Francesco Nukara, a representative of a number of small parliamentary groups participating in the discussions following a meeting with the Prime Minister's candidate.
The Speaker of the House of Representatives of Jean-Franco Fini said he would expect to know whether Mario Monti would ask Parliament to vote on Friday to ensure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The meeting will end with the presentation by Mr. Monti of a limited list of the jury or by the ministers of the head of the country of Georgia Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented yesterday on the nervousness of the fund exchanges and bonds holders, at their request time.
In “Democratic training time is needed for Governments and programmes, he stressed, adding that he was convinced that the markets would be patient and understanding.”
His appointment as President was initially approved by the markets, but concerns arose again, especially after the sudden fall of industrial production in Eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister had to form a team, which included the most important of technology, although he stressed that he would also want to include "politics".
The new Government will have to act by 2013, the date of the next elections, he said.
According to the speaker of the House of Representatives of Jean-Franco Fini, the new Government will receive the full confidence of Parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that once he entered the post, he would work hard to ensure that Italy would again become an important active person in Europe.
The representative of European Commissioner Ollie Rehn stressed that, despite the new Government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed.
The European Union, which was convinced that Rome would not implement the budget for 2013, despite the strict economic plan adopted in recent months, needed, in particular, new strict measures.
The Italian bosses Emma Marchegali, who will meet with him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to relaunch the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot meet the parameters of the deficit."
Mr. Monty, familiar with his competence and independence in the home of the European Commissioner (1994-2004), represented the "change of time" for Italy after 17 years "Berlusconism", "professor", a symbol of "serious challenges" and "other Italy", as the authors say.
The debt of his team is unknown.
President Napolitano would be pleased to avoid early elections, as Italy should pay for public debt commitments of 200 billion euros by April 2012.
Russian scientist assisted the Iranian nuclear programme
Russian scientist Veceslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, confirmed by the American nuclear safety agency Monday.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other United Nations documents to establish the identity of that scientist.
In the past week, IAEA expressed concern about the “probably military aspect” of the Iranian nuclear programme
According to ISIS, which was largely based on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934 and worked for 30 years, “from the beginning of the six hundred years, at the Soviet war nuclear centre in Chelabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic explosives”.
In 1989 or 1991, he left the centre to establish a company producing "nanoalmas" in Kiev.
His company's financial difficulties brought him into contact with the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then worked with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 until his return to Russia.
In its report, IAEA referred to “the evident signs that Iran's development” of the nuclear detonators system “has contributed to the work of a foreign expert who was not only well aware of this technology, but who also informed the Agency that he had worked most of his career on this technology in the military nuclear programme of his country”.
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50 per cent
According to the FBR statistics published on Monday 2009-2010, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 per cent, while other forms of violence on racial and religious grounds were either reduced or not.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, with an increase of 49 per cent compared to an increase of 13 per cent in Catholic violence, a decrease of 4 per cent in Jewish attacks and a total increase of 14 per cent in religious land crimes.
The total number of hate crimes reported by the FBI has increased significantly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent by religious differences.
Following the fall in 2009, concern was expressed that the number of these crimes was growing again, that the human rights organization Human Rights First, “the increase in violence against Muslims is particularly significant”, adds the organization in the official report.
“Human Rights First stressed long ago that acts of violence against a Muslim, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered as serious violations of human rights,” added one of the leaders of Paul Lejandr's organization.
“The American Government can and must do more to deal with these crimes, he adds, believing that this could be done by improving police reports on hate crimes.”
"Access to Hate" in the federal law is the legacy of the civil rights struggle.
This law was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence involving race, colour, religion, nationality, and sexual orientation in our day.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes like Facebook
On Monday's microblog site Twitter has changed its platform, which will allow its users, in particular, to see the activity of those who are watching what this service is doing on Facebook.
The new "activity" tab and other "name" allow you to monitor more easily and directly the activities of other "twitters", the Internet users whose messages you follow ("twits") and those that follow you.
This enables them to know if they publish messages, if they sign new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was protested "in a small percentage of users in August" before the launch of a wide network on Monday, AFP said that Twitter Carolin Penner would be secreted.
Twitter, which has been known for a long time as an intuitively unintuitively unexplained term (RT for overcoming some foreign presence, #followfriday for recommending other users), is primarily a source of satisfaction to experienced users, thus opening themselves for a wider audience, providing users with something closer to popular social networks Facebook and Google+.
In the network, users discussed this update using Twitter on the Internet.
"It's useless, boring and boring to keep on Facebook."
Functional activity will help me better track certain elements of my stream on Twitter, wrote @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction to the Constitution of the Golden Rule
The leadership of the great coalition of democratics and Christian democracies in Austria decided on Tuesday to sign the budget “gold rule” in a Constitution to reduce budget deficits and thus avoid the possible reduction of state credit rating agencies (third A).
The Social Democrat Chancellor Verner Fayman personally announced this decision at the end of the Council of Ministers ' meeting, while Austria ' s government debt was 74.6 per cent higher than the upper standard rate of 60 per cent established by the Maastricht Treaty but below the State debt of such countries as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's ability to pay only one item, from AAA to AA+, we should pay interest to three thousand million euros more each year, the argument of Vice-Cancler and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Christian Democrats Michael Schpindlegger has come up.
Austria therefore met the requirement of the Eurozone summit on 26 October in Brussels; the Heads of State and Government needed to reduce budget deficits by the end of 2012 and return to balance-of-state accounts through the Constitution or by equivalent law.
The decision adopted by the Austrian Government recalls the German model, since Germany was the first European country to adopt the rule.
By 2017, the structural deficit of the public budget should be reduced to 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) per year, and from 2017 the structural deficit of the State's federal budget should not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP per year, and the countries and municipalities should present balanced budgets.
The aim of the State debt is to be reduced to 60 per cent of the note by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Esihiko Noda
Threats new intervention on the currency market
Japanese Prime Minister Esikhiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would engage in new monetary market interventions if their value continued to grow.
We agree, as we have done in the past, if we consider the excess volume of the exchange course of iron, Mr. Noda Sanatu explained.
On Tuesday, Jana was raised almost to a historical note, which encouraged Japan's authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold an extra dollar loan to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which had established a new force record since 1945.
Since then, however, it has grown steadily, driven by the purchases of investors who recognize it as “a refugee” in these dark times of the global economy and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar dropped below 77 euros, and the euro dropped below the symbolic plan in 105 yen, almost at the level that led to the last intervention.
The financial crisis in 2008-2009 was estimated at around $120 and more than €160.
The growth in Japanese currency is damaging Japanese exports because it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the income of Japanese companies from abroad when they convert into national currency.
“Japan is struggling to rebuild itself” after the earthquake and tsunamis of 11 March, which left the Tohoku region in the north-east, stressed Mr. Noda, who was afraid that this growth of iron would kill the poor seed of restoration.
In the world, the third economic state has resumed growth in the third quarter of 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - the first year - thanks to the growth of exports and household consumption of disasters
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of them does not reflect the "fundamental economic indicators of Japan".
Minister of Finance, Jean-Azumi, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened its two-day meeting on monetary policy on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to reduce the gap.
However, the deputy managing agency Hirohida Yamaguti warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “relevant steps” to understand that no additional mitigation in the environment should be expected.
At the last meeting, at the end of October, the issuing organization increased the purchase of camouflage bonds to 5,000 million euros (47 billion euros) by up to 55,000 million yen (519 billion euros) the amount it allocates for the purchase of various financial instruments to promote the market in securities.
Eurozone
Growth rates, fund exchanges are broken up
The risk of damage to the debt crisis undermines European indexes.
Despite the appointment of new heads of State in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in unstable countries continue to grow.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, European burgeoners entered the area on Tuesday, 15 November, a little further.
In Paris at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent and finished trade at 3.064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt dropped by 0.4% and London by 0.1%.
In view of the new difficulties with the payment of loans to the eurozone countries in difficulty, the global financial markets continue to lose part of their recent achievements.
" Concerned investors are just too concerned about the risk of injury," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional IG Markets broker quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo branch closed by 0.7 per cent of new market participants' doubts about Europe's ability to hold a debt crisis.
"As with the rest of the world, Japan has stopped its view on Europe, and the exchanges will follow each other in the corridor of narrow changes until investors have confirmed that the situation has been stabilized," said Michyoshi Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management
This return to concern about the future euro area is a single currency that continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has reached its lower mark for a month and a half.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was $1,3570, down to 0.4%.
According to the brokers, she fell after the meeting of Angel Merkel HDS Chancellor Party on Monday, on which the resolution was adopted, providing, in particular, the opportunity for the countries in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates above 6 per cent
Loans in Italy and Spain remain at a high level.
On Tuesday morning, the income of the 10-year Italian bonds reached 6.85 per cent and the income of the Spanish bonds reached 6.2 per cent.
These problems with percentage rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to pose a threat to the participants.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, asked in time to restore the situation in Italy that was under the threat of a paralysing debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Papalimos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be “the main task” of his Government.
Spain was exposed to markets in front of parliamentary elections on Wednesday.
In the face of the 10-year debt rates between Germany and Spain, a new historical ceiling has been reached.
Expected growth figure in Eurozone
France has had an economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3 per cent, due to increased household consumption.
Insee, however, reviewed the reduction in the second quarter, with a fall in 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnant.
The fourth quarter is mostly concerned by economists.
Germany, in turn, had fixed the growth of 0.5 per cent for the same period.
The first assessment of the whole euro area is expected on 11 a.m., and the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is a subject that cannot be decided after a long discussion or under the influence of emotions, that is an energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing capacity and competitiveness of companies.
This is a healthy trend that electoral meetings are a cause for reflection on the role and place of nuclear energy.
It will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options are examined.
France should build its view on objective facts and rational data.
Now, we have 7 billion people on the planet, demographic development will be a double demand for electricity by 2050, unless only a large part of the world's population is left with vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to meet the growing resource deficit in order to continue to generate electricity, without forgetting the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate imbalance, which has disappeared from environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains one in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which puts its decision on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, are just a few of those who are determined to continue their projects.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to add one installation to its complex by rebuilding the station that was halted after the accident at Tri-Mill Island.
Although the model of Germany based on renewable energy sometimes leads to an example, the reality contradicts this argument.
Berlin's election will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, increased the increased demand for imported gas, in particular from Russia, for carbon emissions from gas and coal stations.
Within a few months, all these adverse effects will be felt.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
Europe's turbine-building champion, from which it receives 30% of its electricity, is the same as the largest coal and gas consumer because of the interrupted wind; why carbon gas emissions and electricity prices, respectively, are 65% and 50% higher than in Europe.
On the other hand, thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40 per cent more for electricity than for French households.
As the global energy price is a key factor in competitiveness and the supply of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies are benefiting from the very low electricity supply in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will result in a significant increase in the cost of electricity, which will make allegation of the new industrialization of our country and the protection of purchasing capacity.
The price that most French people refuse to pay is more because they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country ' s energy policy has made it possible to create a industry in 125,000 direct workplaces and 410,000 surrounded.
Strongly focused on exports, it attracted the entire landscape of the international trade of small and medium-sized enterprises and created many jobs that could not be transferred to another industry.
If France had decided to give up nuclear energy, it would have had to sacrifice a large number of these enterprises and lose 6 billion euros per year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What engineer will be ordering EPR to work for sixty years if his manufacturer's closure is planned?
In order to resolve energy imbalances, it should be recognized that there are no divine or demonic sources of energy production.
The development of Areva with low carbon emissions, nuclear and renewables, demonstrates the interdependence of energy sources.
The high level of security is undoubtedly an important issue for nuclear energy
In France, we have a security body that exercises uncomplicated and transparent control of existing energy centres, such as Flamanville.
Our teams, which are generally recognized as professionalism, are full of the same security.
For 50 years, the atomic industry has survived three serious incidents.
Only one, Tri-Mill Island, has occurred under normal conditions of operation, but without any human or environmental impact
In Montenegro, the reactor device and an uncomplicated human error have led to tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the tragedy has resulted in two natural disasters of unprecedented force that have resulted in tens of thousands of deaths.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident as it came from two previous generations.
The result of this step and cooperation between security agencies, operators and French and German designers, EPR, is a project that is capable of countering such developments.
As it is considered by all energy specialists who want to build a reactor, the halt of its construction in Flamanville will be a great gift to competitors Areva and EDF and will clear their way to lead to the inevitable development of atomic energy.
It is necessary and legitimate to look for the best integration of the sources of energy for our country, but it would be inappropriate to allow emotions, ideals and manoeuvres to rise in the dispute, which is so important to our country's economic, social and financial situation.
Immigration is a burden or a favor to the economy?
The immigration policy at Nikola Sarkozi was criticised by various parties, including the overload of police, judicial and administrative services, the digital policies and the compatibility of this policy with France's so-called "State of Human Rights".
Then there was the administrative stress of foreign students who had fallen into the news when the Minister of Internal Affairs (Liberaçon of 23 May) said that France "does not need foreign talent, stones and officers".
But it is very rarely analysed from a economic point of view.
The rights and the left in this matter are very much in line.
On the right hand side, James Shirak, who stated in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed will not be a problem in the country with 2 million foreign workers", and on the left hand, Michel Roker, who explained in 1990 that France "cannot accept the poor from all over the world."
Differences only at the level of generosity
In 2005, fear of entry into the territory of the country was felt both left and right.
Both sides see the burden of immigration for the French economy and for the French society.
The difference is only in the level of generosity that they allow immigrants to show.
In its programme, France, the Netherlands limited itself to bananas, saying that "co-operation will solve our immigration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may give an electrical advantage, but it is economically expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffry Cameron remind us in a recent book, which contains the latest data on immigration (special people: how migration has shaped our world and will determine our future, May 2011, publication of Princeton University, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Immigrants are undermining growth and reducing employment.
The pressure to influence immigrants is based on the idea that they can replace local workers, particularly low-qualified workers, by reducing wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants actually do much more than replace local labour force by work that does not fit local labour force.
Unqualified immigrants are working in sectors that do not involve local labour force, and the most qualified are in dynamic sectors where education is not linked to proposals for work.
Positive impact on payments
Just as surgery would be difficult to work in a country where there is a lack of anesthetics, the complement that exists between local and immigrant immigrants has a positive effect on the wage of local workers.
Joanni Perry estimated that the growth of 1% of the migration flows would result in an increase of 0.6-0.9% of real long-term payments.
This is without the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (in the United States of America's Nobel Prize for the large share of naturalized immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo - were all founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also benefiting from social security systems, with an average of 1 per cent of the total budgets of European countries.
According to the World Labour Organization, for example, an immigrant in Germany, who is 30 years old, will provide a clean public budget (less cost) for the average of 150,000 euros, according to the estimates of the World Labour Organization.
Nicola Sarcosi, at the beginning of his mandate, was gathering his teeth into a lack of growth.
The above-mentioned teeth used to scare immigrants had a negative effect.
Europe has chosen democracy, and the European democracy remains to be conceived
Democracy is a valuable acquisition, but it is also fragile.
The European continent must remember that it had suffered in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the 20th century, the tragedy of World War I, the totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulf, as well as the Franco in Spain, the Salazar in Portugal and the Colonels in Greece.
Some felt that democracy would ultimately be on guard against its enemies, enough to raise the vote and make it as direct as possible.
Since Napoleon's time, it's known that it's from the surface of the mind.
The general vote, although a mandatory condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can even be a "pressure instrument", as the philosopher Etienne Vashro once said.
No, democracy requires much more -- public space, public spirit, values, organizations, division and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is the economic crisis, but primarily it is the political crisis and the crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the true-life Greek referendum would have a double-definition effect, demonstrating the need for a serious policy change, as well as an unpleasant sense of its incompatibility and incompatibility.
This duality needs to be imagined in order to overcome it.
The fact is that the front line for the fight against democracy has now begun, and many believe that the Republican soldiers are now not on that side.
We do not win anything by requiring a series of national referendums organized on a scale of similarity and in a catholic manner.
"Cart-blansh" for an absolute European monarch or a related leg failure - what a choice for a citizen!
No, we don't think of gluten lesion, but it's a joint, clear and continuous implementation of elections and democracy, at this time at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and the extent to which they will still be listed, because there is only one crisis — the crisis in Europe.
Europe as a whole is subject to market and rating agencies, suffering from weakness and lack of solidarity.
Europe is all dishonored at an international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of Europe’s sovereignty, but Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The administration of the European project under national sovereignty needs to be restored rapidly.
Because only joint Europeans can reduce the burden of each one's debt, release from the markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at the European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, without causing us disasters.
After a long discussion of this proposal, the Socialists and Jako Delor still demand the European Economic Government.
Let's do it.
But to present itself without the stronger economic, political and democratic integration that has taken place in the long run is a real nonsense and a new puzzle.
We must start a new phase of European construction.
In order to establish a Republic of France, the Republicans had to "represent" themselves.
The revolution of interest would be insufficient.
The lesson remains true.
We must build a single economic-level Europe.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, which is now the national European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let's create Europeans.
Non-contact chips are being distributed widely.
The World Chip Map exhibition is opened on Tuesday in Wilpente under Paris in the atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 11 per cent of global microprocessor sales (bank cards, SIM cards) will end in 2011, over 6,000 million units, according to Eurosmart.
The most important non-contactd technology sector, which allows the payment of public transport or purchases, simply to carry out a card on a machine.
In this year, 460 million wireless chips will be sold in the world against 320 million years ago!
Their share will grow in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and will account for nearly 10 per cent of the world's chip-card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long been away from the Asia and the Pacific region, is now moving forward in the area of uncontacted payments.
About 26 million Visa bank cards have already been provided with this function, and they are received by 75,000 terminals.
France is starting with a more modest position: 400,000 non-contact cards of Visa are being dealt with.
But large stores are increasing temperatures.
This year, Carrefour released 2.5 million uncontacted Pass MasterCard.
To move at a higher rate, banks need to provide their customers with equipment.
“Two large organizations in France have promised to regularly distribute bank cards to their clients for use in the future, as reported by Gerar Nebui, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks test payments using a mobile phone.
But it's just the first phase of the future payment, it's a mobile phone.
Only a few devices are equipped with the NFC technology (Communication of a nearby field) needed to carry out such transactions.
"They were abandoned.
"But they have to fly now in the next year."
"We count on world sales from 80 to 120 million units in 2012, explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are coming forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced an experiment from December to June in Canada.
The iPhone equipment will provide approximately 200 clients and staff with cables to provide non-contact payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Société Genérale also stated yesterday that he was preparing to launch a proposal that would allow his clients to pay via mobile phones.
The terrorist front is spread from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relationship between Islamic Maghreb and Sect Boko Haram.
The long-standing link between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram was confirmed.
The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that Algerians are now convinced of this.
“The methods used by these two organizations and the reports of the secret services show that they are actively cooperating,” he explained without involving details.
Paris seems to have come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation of the acquisition of two Frenchmen in Niger in January revealed two related names.
The people of Aqmi, Antuan de Leukour and Vincent Delori, who were kidnapped in the Niamé restaurant, were reportedly killed the following day, along with several of the kidnappers during the operation carried out by the French Special Forces.
Among the shells left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several telephony cards belonging to terrorists.
Here's the terror.
The analysis of the location of calls indicated that several of the colleagues in Mali, Niger and Nigeria were present.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one refers to a Nigerian who lived in Maydiguri, a city in northern Nigeria, where Boko Haram and the other, to a person, as it is claimed, near Aqmi and to the sect.
"This step forward, but certainly more reliable evidence must be expected before it comes to the operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But that's possible."
"It has been known for many years that the sect is receiving financial and ideal support outside and that it is becoming more and more active," says the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amovo.
In recent months this support has become increasingly evident in the actions and statements of Boko Haram and in its methods, which now include the use of mortals and increasingly complex explosive devices of the same type as Aqmi.
The international community, in its head with Washington, is now pushing Abuja to focus on the problems created by Boko Haram.
The case was that the Nigerian authorities traditionally viewed this group as a community of educated people who were not interested.
A Speedy Success
Founded in Maydigri in 2002 at the Mohammede Yusufe, a school and a fund-raising student, Boko Haram - which means "a Western education is a sin" - preachs the establishment of a Islamic emir at the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has made rapid progress.
It was politicalized and demanded strict compliance with the Sharia, and its activists began to fight against the corrupt central government.
It is aimed primarily at churches, bars, and authorities.
In 2009, activists, Boko Haram, had been particularly active, taking many attacks on police offices.
Abuja's reaction, as usual, is uncomplicated.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead after him.
Mohammed (peace and blessings be upon him) killed Yusuf (Joseph) who was taken alive.
Now the sect is radicalized and will go beyond its northern roots.
In the past generation, she took responsibility for the action that resulted in the murder of 80 people in Jose and then another in Abuja.
In June in Abuja Boko Haram organized the first death attack on a strengthened police headquarters.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations will be their first international objective.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now concerned by all security experts.
Today, when Aqmi has been strengthened in Mali and Niger, while Somalis from Al-Shabaab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, President Gudlak Jonathan Allen Juppe warned of the danger of Boko Haram and expressed his willingness to share all available information.
Peace as seen by Republican candidates as presidents
With regard to China, Iran and Israel's assistance to Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry, they are faced with simplification and incompetence.
Can America’s crisis be weakened by a complex world with simple, more direct, simple ideas?
If the candidates were to be heard by the presidents of the Republicans, the electors could believe that.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been a lot of ugly, but missing details of the foreign policy statements that are traditionally a strong party to the Republicans.
Lies relating to China, Iran and Israel are often mixed with one another.
Mitt Romni, whose best chances of moving from the Old Good Party, threatened to file a complaint to the Chinese at WTO and accuse them of "manipulating their currency - is a sensitive issue for America, which is fueled by the migration of all sectors of its industry in Asia.
It's worse if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Ambassador Obama in China and the only candidate who understood the complex foreign policy, was unable to overcome a position that was emotional.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (now Obama).
But Hansman, who lives in the lower part of the ratings, remains unheard of.
Reygan's style.
Romania also promised military attacks on Iran if sanctions could not stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran, he'll bring it back."
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to strengthen Israel ' s military assistance by accusing Obama of failing to comply with the promises of that partner.
The entrepreneur, Herman Cain, the second in the ranking of candidates, has demonstrated a disturbing lack of knowledge of the case.
He recently called against the Chinese military threat, because Beijing is trying to gain nuclear power, obviously not knowing that China has had it since 1964!
Governor Texas Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military attacks on Iran, said that he was ready to use the American Army in Mexico against drug dealers.
It is also recommended that Cain, Perry and the candidate Michel Bahman should be subjected to the torture of suspected terrorism prohibited by Obama in 2009.
All of this is very far from the 2008 Republican candidate John Mackein, a heavy foreign policy.
The opposition of the current President replied that Reygan also had simple ideas and that he had won a cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was a lover and that he had to lower his tone with regard to the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his innovative dialogue with Iran, on the pre-emergency conclusion of the Iraqi fish, his catches in Libya, which brought him a reputation for a weak policy.
But it's not that simple.
The people considered the positive balance of national security with Obama, which had eliminated Ben Laden.
Then Iraq does not believe in military intervention that binds to sand.
And, affirming that America needs to rebuild economics in order to regain its leadership, Obama's rights.
North stream, new doors for Russian gas entry into Europe.
The gas flow of the North River, connecting Western Europe and Russia directly to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, was launched.
It is estimated to provide gas equivalent to 30 million households.
The Russian giant gas producer wanted to release this event with pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, attended last Tuesday on the Baltic shores, between the orchestra and the search for meals, in the opening of the North River, a new gas pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly under water.
The German Chancellor Angel Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fion and his Dutch colleague Mart Rutte, together returned a symbolic valve controlling the Russian gas flow into the Western European network.
According to the new gas pipeline, 27.5 million additional cubic metres of gas will be spent annually in Western Europe on the first round of 1,224 km, connecting the Leningrad region with the Meklingburg-Pomerania land.
The second pipeline must be ready at the end of 2012, providing a total of 55 million cubic metres of gas equivalent to the entire consumption of France.
The possibility of building a third pipeline on the same path has already been discussed.
The timely completion of this huge project for the Gaza Strip is a victory.
The project met with severe opposition from Poland and the Baltic States.
The North River will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding transit through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries lose part of their power: they will become more vulnerable to Russia, threatening to close access to the Western European markets.
The most pressing moment of the debate in Warsaw did not stand in front of the North Pole compared to the new German-Soviet Agreement, with the aim of joining Hitler and Stalin in order to occupy Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
With the support of the Russian project, Western Europe is making its delivery safer.
But Europe's cost of energy loss is because the project has created a bridge between Eastern and Western Europe.
Russia has been able to gain understanding of the direct union between Russia and the rich Western countries that consume large amounts of gas and whose own stocks are already in the background.
"This gas pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, this new arterial that links us organically," said France Fiion, opening the gas pipeline, demonstrating to the extent that large gas contracts are important and politically and economically.
All of this explains the wide gap between the Heads of the Gasproma, who attended a large number in Lubmin, the point of arrival of gas.
The weapons of this gas pipeline are also a technical drive.
The underground pipeline is made of a concrete building to protect it from the coroner of ships.
He's lying on the beach day, on the middle of 200 meters.
In order to build it, it had to cover the mines remaining in the second world war.
"The plot had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jans Muller, the North Pole press secretary.
There was also a need to take many steps to protect the fungus and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake with a weight equal to the weight of 242 Ephele bass, without all the length of it, without valves and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the management of the project was rejected because Sweden was not concerned that the Russian State company would always move to its borders.
"In the event of an accident, we're closing the gas flow less than a minute," says Jens Muller.
So in case of gas leaks in the gas pipeline, it goes into the air.
But this seems to be small-scale designers that have designed wires that are calculated only once per 100,000 years.
The gas flow control will be carried out by a underwater robot that holds the ship for external monitoring as well as by a vehicle that is circling inside the gas pipeline.
The safety device shall be inserted inside the tube diameter 1 m and shall be extended in front of the gas flow.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at a speed of 3 metres per second, it shall provide accurate information on any metal deformation.
The gas pipeline was designed for work for 50 years without the need for a smaller repair.
Gas circulation is carried out only through its pressure.
It consists of 200 bar at departure and 100 bar at arrival.
Five companies have combined efforts to implement the project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51 per cent of the capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5 per cent each), Dutch Gasunie and French GDF Suez (9 per cent each).
The five companies established a joint venture called the North River, which was commissioned to build and operate gas pipelines.
Its headquarters is located in Cuge, Switzerland, where taxes are particularly favourable.
After that, Gazprom gave the company a 20-year lease with the possibility of extending the total amount of gas transport.
"The gas will be paid in full, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Muller.
The gas pipeline was financed by 30 per cent of shareholders and 70 per cent of bank loans.
The total cost of work is 7.4 billion euros for two pipelines.
The GDF Suez investments will be around 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are convinced that they will earn their costs because the Gasprom takes all the risks.
The gas pipeline runs from the Baltic Sea to Lubmin on a sandy beach contaminated by wild trees.
The ventilator is 4.5 meters high, forming the exhaust outlet.
Deductors measure pressure, temperature and specific gas characteristics before switching it into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received one million cubic metres of gas every hour.
It will be 3 million in full power in time, and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine brand block
Moleskine, created by an Italian company 15 years ago, will taste the letter.
It has an amalgam of attachment, times that were written in the light of the light.
The Moleskine block is easy to find out about the direct black cover, about the risk, on the yellow-white pages, which are the ones you want with time.
However, the book Moleskine, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, located in Milan, decided to start selling designer blocks.
Maria Sebregondi, then company consultant, took responsibility for starting a new product.
The block is inspired by the old production technique, a mollusc, a latrine, used for example, to cover the chameleon.
This type of blockade is confirmed to be highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine brought in today's taste an old and forgett thing that was cultural to the Avangardic artists until the 20th century," said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the master brand in Mode Mode.
Good luck.
Sales increased by 25 per cent from 2006 to 2010 and reached 12.7 million stocks.
We went far from the production of the first years when almost 3,000 blocks were made.
Moleskine crossed the Italian border and was exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Set the typical buyer's profile is heavy because the blockade is equally attractive to businessmen, students and free people.
Moleskine buyers are cosmopolitan, with a wide range of views and education.
The small Italian company, which initially had 12 staff, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its blockages in Fnac bookstores, store stores in small towns and has been able to acquire extensive knowledge.
“We have followed the spirit of time and this new need in writing, despite the e-mail,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This characteristic of culture is accompanied by the development of Moleskine; recently the brand organized the exhibition "Environmental Path", where architects and artists demonstrated their own blocks.
In August, he also launched a Leopard painting on a movie scene in Locarno.
Using its achievements and cultural aura, Moleskine has differentiated its products that now include bags, hands, bags for computers. Brand includes all kinds of support.
Success resulting from the addiction: Modo Modo was purchased by the SG Capital Europe investment fund, now syntegra Capital, which has written a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is unemployment among workers with disabilities so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of work of persons with disabilities begins today.
Despite public welfare policy, the proportion of unemployment among persons with disabilities is still twice the average, i.e. 19 per cent against 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
He's taking care of it?
“No, - emphasizes Eric Blanche, Director-General of Adapt, organizations that organize the week of work for disabled persons.”
"A significant progress has been made for 15 years."
"At the time, the percentage of unemployed was not 2 but 3 times more."
"But there's still a lot of work to do."
It must be said that there is still much to be done for persons with disabilities at work.
Among them are older: 37 per cent over 50 years of age (17 per cent on average).
They have a lower level of qualification: 80 per cent do not have bacalavr levels, and only 10 000 of the 2.3 million students in higher education are disabled.
Finally, there is a very widespread long-term unemployment rate of 85 per cent for persons with disabilities against 38 per cent on average.
In short, all of these criteria are very difficult to return to work and are a major problem," said Kristian Grapen, Director-General Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies hire workers with disabilities.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about a change of mind but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entrepreneur Association on Cité's orders showed that the questioned managers had a low level of knowledge of disability and that they “presented themselves with common people in wheelchairs or mental or mental disorders”.
The result is private companies with more than 20 employees still far from the goal of having 6 per cent disabled workers under the law adopted in 1987.
The latest figures for 2008 were 2.6 per cent.
"We are about 3 per cent today," said Pierre Blan, Director General Agefiph, organizations responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of “payable” organizations as well as the amounts paid has decreased from 59,000 to 46,000 organizations in 2007-2011 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which imposed taxes, created a strong pressure on the company, explains Pierre Blan."
“But this improvement also reflects awareness-raising, in particular, of large enterprises.”
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of workers from 20 to 49 have disabled workers against 82 per cent of workers from 100 to 199.
Assassin: "What luck."
Before meeting with the Sinimim tonight at 20.45 p.m., Eden Asar and George Leeds did not hide the satisfaction they received from this friendly match.
We're not going to come up to claim that there was a secret conversation between them, but the picture is symbolic.
A couple of times on the arenas, the Stade de France, George Leedes and Eden Asars died.
Five months later, after his attack on Turkey, the Belgian trainer could only congratulate him.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his movement and the fact that he's a liar."
"I want to go further," said the game Lille.
As long as the difference between his achievements in the club and in the collection, that's one whole, he's right.
"I'm in Lille for a year, and there's no Belgium."
"I have to work my glasses."
Left in the stock, in front of this match with France, in the game against Romania on Friday evening, Asar came to St. Denny to end his "blow".
I don't forget, however, about the concept of "satisfaction."
He supported children from 7 years of age and successful campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I have always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also strengthens the particular character of this match.
And on the other hand, there are Matthew, John, and Adil, on the other hand," he recalls.
"Our roads have just crossed."
"To have the chance to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leetz kindly reminded me of pride.
The pride to play in the empty-fashioned mother.
The pride also affirms as a "neighbor", that France has again become a very high-level team every year after the trauma in Naizna.
"Loran Blan was like a hit by a crowd, he wakes up.
Now, when Belgium misss the next Euro, a technical athlete will fly in one plane with the leadership of the blues... in Brazil in 2014.
"Our little whites grow," he stressed.
"We're building something, games ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will be convinced of this in future matches, including this against France."
Portugal is very confident
Portugal, Paul Bentu, begins its response fight against Bosnia (22.00 p.m.) on Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On his way, the two teams were said to have lost their sense of reality.
"By the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paul Bentu is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt that the Assembly, in its role since September 2010, is qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal is 90 minutes lucky.
But there's a match to play, and Bosnia has to win.
With 0 to 0 on Friday in the garden of Zenica, it's clear that the game isn't over.
Although Portugal had dominated the country for more than an hour, it failed to achieve the promising goal that would bring her comfort.
"This is a good result, however, which will take a certain risk."
But in his bright-lighted stadium, de la Luis in Lisbon, Portuguese are convinced that they will go to the public, which should be in the wake of the storm, even though the match will be very tense," said the optimistic, but reasonable Bent.
"We expect a very busy match, but we are convinced that we can win, said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50 per cent of the chances to be in Europe 2012," said Deputy Carlush Keiros.
Nothing on Friday in the match against Bosnia demands victory from Portugueses.
Nothing could build the Bosnians.
"That's a good result, however, some risk, is sorry Bento.
"We will play against a team with many technical values and a lot of individual values," he added.
As was already in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to make maximum pressure on Bosnians from the very beginning, "don't give them time to think".
Good idea, it would only be realistic this time.
