Food owes European inflation
The main reason for the rise in inflation in the euro area was the rising food prices.
In the 13 countries of the euro area, tension was expected to be higher than in November - after 2.6 per cent in October an annual rate of inflation was recorded by 3.1 per cent, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are only 3 per cent spent, reported Bloomberg.
In contrast to the US, British and Canadian notation bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced its liquidity.
The ECB intends to maintain inflation rates below two per cent, or at least at least on the two per cent market.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the medium term: inflation needs to be "responsible" to exclude future action needs.
With 3.3 percent, the inflation rate reached a 12-year record rate in Germany in November; in Spain, the rate dropped from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The increased food and energy prices were responsible for increasing inflation in the euro area.
The MATIF rating rose by 88 per cent, and the course for Sojabohnen has also reached a record record since 1973.
There was also a major trend in food oil and milk products in 2007.
The world market price for oil rose by 52 percent this year - in the past month, the price per face of the black gold reached nearly $100.
As a result, the ECB will increase inflation from 2.1 to 2.5% in 2008, but it is estimated to fall by 1.9% in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts from a 3-percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 per cent.
For 2008 experts have calculated that the ECB will double its interest rates.
Gallup is facing a government crisis
The number of Fidesz sympathists has grown significantly since the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has had the largest base camp, while the approval for the Socialists according to Gallup has never reached a point of 13 per cent.
In the case of partial voters, the difference is marked by the high resolution of the opposition advocates: more than two thirds (71 per cent) agree a fifth (20 per cent) agreement for the MSZP.
MDF and SZDSZ are based on the question of parliamentary admission: they come in the total population by two percent.
The number of participants has increased by a percentage in both stocks.
Compared to the last depth, the general economic vote has continued to worsen - never before was the proportion of those who judged the country's economy as "extraordinary" so high (41 per cent), while 46 per cent considered it "very bad".
Following more promising prospects in the spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the next year, the majority of the population is estimated to have a further deterioration of the situation; only one tenth of the population is affected by an improvement.
A Gallup survey conducted in December revealed that 71% of the respondents - a historical high - judged the prime minister's work as "more evil than right".
Thirty-three percent of the respondents have strong trust or trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while 38 percent of the sponsors for Viktor Orbán.
About 54% do not trust the Head of Government, compared with 27% of the mystery against the Fidesz Party.
One of the indicators of political vote is the number of those who think that you could get the satisfaction of the Prime Minister even without changing governments.
After the disturbances in last October, 35% had spoken for the Government and the Head of Government, this proportion today is only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) is only looking at the solution in the news.
According to her interest in the referendum, 60 percent said that they would participate "in security" and another 20% would give their vote "probably".
In comparison, if Parliament's elections were to take place this Sunday, only 55% would go "safely" to the Urins, 15% would hold their participation for "probably". In view of these trends the outcome of the referendum would be invisible.
74% would be against the student fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% would vote against the hospital-Taglald.
As regards the group of participants in the "safety" referendum, the proportions of the anti-study, practice and hospital fees would be even 81, 84, or 89 per cent.
Upgrading at the top, Tesco increases by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Bulgarian trade area have also maintained the average price increase of 16% over the last year, with the difference that this year did not result in a rise in VAT.
Article out of Napi Economy
The price of the regular Christmas basket of the "Napi" has also increased by 16 percent this year in the Bulgarian trade district, but more than 1,000 HUF prices have been recorded in all hypermarkets.
After the prices in the food markets have been "davangatoped" in last December, the distortion has not suddenly emerged as a percentage compared to the unprecedented, early level of output.
However, it has been pointed out to consumers that this year is not even available for 10,000 HUFs for which they have paid less than 9,000 HUF in the last year.
The price of the "Napi" cart exceeds the magical 10,000 HUF limits of at least 91 HUF in the markets under investigation.
The highest price was 10.573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6,800 HUF.)
The prices for Unicum and live fish remain close to the previous year's level, although the prices for powder, nuts and mohn are high.
Prices for flour and bread speak the data of the Hungarian Central Statistical Office, however, there were 1kg broth Weeks for 139 Forint.
There was no competitive price ruling in the product under 200 Forint.
Also surprising was the price of two litres of Coca-Cola Pfand bottle of less than 200 Forint, so the drink included only 257 HUF.
However, this year cuts in the "Napi" commodity basket comparisons of eyes at the most expensive, and Cora at the most expensive.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased prices in the "Napi" shopping basket against Christmas prices in the past year by 15, while Tesco and Auchan have increased by 18 percent each.
The difference between the cheapest basket of the previous year and the cheapest of the present year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest basket of the previous year and the lowest price of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480.00 HUF.
The average price increase was still in the previous year at 1.206.00 Forint, however, the VAT increase was noted for the last Christmas season.
This is exactly what has been done: the sellers may not have been able to determine exactly what pricepan they should use in the individual articles, as the effects of price increases on the consumer behaviour were invisible.
(If the dealer is planning the pace of a product wrong, he may fall in the price range that is directed at the traffic intensity.)
In the past year, the construction of the "Napi" shopping cart was so radical that the costiest basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, although the price difference in the cheapest basket was only 844 Forint.
This year such extremes were not observed, as the cost of the most expensive basket was 1.630.00 Forint more than last year, and even at the cheapest price, there was a price increase of 1.284.00 Forint.
In comparison with the last two Christmas season, there was a catastrophic price increase, which increased the price of the daily consumer product in the hypermarkets in less than 20 months by more than 30 percent.
(This does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: In some basic food products, the Statistical Office established a more than 30 per cent of the population for 12 months.
So in about a mile, even at eggs.)
However, if you look at the "Napi" basket, this seems almost impossible at the latest, as the price level of the raw product has reached almost 10 per cent even in the worst case in the previous year.
Apparently, the bidders were in a stronger position than the bidders - they were always able to reduce the dramatic price increase to the majority.
The hypermarkets don't complain about the golden deal; it's been reported for good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three shopping houses are no longer paying attention to the prices.
It will be purchased from all large quantities, sustainable food will go to pallets over the Ladentics.
On Monday morning morning, there were endless noises in all three shopping houses at the casino as the number of customers exploded suddenly.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported from the country, so many people regret that they could not even achieve the planned consumption, although not only in food, but also in sustainable consumers.
Many places are distributed to disinfectants
More than a thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals that have been returned to an inappropriate treatment with antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overload of staff - all factors that are not directly attributable to the introduction of infections, are the leading doctors of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many places are also divided into the disinfectants.
A MRSA infection was diagnosed in the traumatology department of János Hospital.
The antibiotic bacteria were found in a male patient who was administered after a severe accident in the hospital.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was a similar infection.
The injury of a severe car accident was released from the hospital, but a short time later the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important operation could not be performed because of the bacteria still present in the patient's body.
Up to 10 December this year, multi-resisting governments have reported infections to the National Nosocomialis Survey System, thus leading doctors of the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many of the infections caused by multi-resisting regimes have been registered in hospitals with safety, which must be higher than the number of dengues.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were resolved by the MRSA, the Staphyloccus aureus resistant to Methicillin-Oxacillin.
The Staphyloccus aureus (SA) bacteria carries about a third of the people in their nose, without causing a disease.
SA-conditioned infections (such as hives, mandeldensing, skin rashes or pruritus) usually react well to antibiotics, they are very healthy.
However, if the funds are too high or not used, they are derived from the well-responsive bacteria antibiotics that rapidly spread in the hospitals.
In particular in patients with weak, chronicly ill functioning immune system, but also in older patients, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria may cause serious infections such as ventricular infection or blood loss, so sepsis.
According to the medical director of János Hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such events are part of the day of the hospital.
The infection should not be removed with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA was not only there where it is not sought.
Antibiotic resistance
"These patients are isolated, the care staff carries rubber gloves and masks in the supply, and we have the antibiotics that are needed for the treatment" - says Tibor Nyulasi.
Although patients are tested at MRSA when given into the hospital, an infection cannot be avoided at all times.
Samples to be reported
Most of the infections managed by MRSA in hospitals would be preventable, but the prevailing conditions and conditions are unacceptable for reducing the outbreak or the spread of the multi-resisting host, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and elderly patients, the speculators should investigate the patients ingested and immediately isolate MRSA infected.
However, microbiological sampling is not often practiced in Hungarian hospitals.
Not least because there are no references to this investigation outside the State Hospital.
Therefore, most cases come to light only if the patient already has a significant MRSA infection, so the medical director of the epidemiology center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases in Hungary.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological studies are necessary to prevent resistance to the medium, but this Directive will not always be implemented by hospitals.
Among the ambulances or patients in primary care, microbiological sampling was even more rare, as was done by Karolina Böröcz.
Disinfective agents are divided into groups
Scientific evidence indicates that MRSA will be transferred from one patient to the other most often by the care staff.
That is why handwashing, or wearing handbags and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by flufine infection or contact, but there is not always the possibility of insulating infected patients.
The rooms are even often filled, the beds are almost opposite, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 metres between them from epidemiological view.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, even in the less well-established hospitals, there are few caregivers, many patients - all factors that directly benefit from the outbreak of infections.
Such infections are likely to be far less frequent, relatively able to maintain the further spread of the host, where these protective measures are maintained, as is Karolina Böröcz.
Government against MRSA
Access to MRSA infections in the Griff causes enormous costs of health insurance, so they are being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its deterioration in the government programme, was established.
According to the first signs, the program is successful - as published data, the trend of MRSA infections in England is slowing down.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has explained the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistance agents (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals as a priority.
He wasn't drunk with the murder police.
In the case of the police chief of the XXII district, car accidents resulting from a fatal accident now present the official opinion.
The former police chief of the XXII. The area that killed a pedestrian on the day of a car accident was neither alcoholized nor under the influence of drugs, said Attila Morvia, the press speaker of the Budapest Supreme Court on Friday after the official opinion was presented.
The opinion confirmed the results of the first investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before being taxed.
The former police chief booked with his own Pkw in XXII. The district entered the Kossuth Laios Street and passed through a 55-year-old man who crossed the street to an unknown place.
(According to STVO, however, this does not have a mild condition - the linker, even if footsteppers do not cross the street at the Zebrastreifen, aftergang.)
The pedestrian is injured after his delivery to the hospital.
According to police reports, the Linker suffered a shock, then returned his functions and sought pension.
The State Government of Budapest has introduced its findings to the case.
Attila Morva also mentioned that the former chief of police had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
Other EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Minister of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three credit agreements in the total amount of EUR 400 million on Friday.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) granted a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects implemented under the Cohesion Fund.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement should also be allocated to the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has granted total EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the context of the extension of the credit agreement.
In the area of innovation, the Contracting Parties signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly be carried out in research and development programmes at Debrecen University.
At the meeting, the U.S. line 4 also became a language.
It was agreed that as soon as Hungary has clarified the details of road financing with the EU, the original contract and any amendments will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects totalling EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
Credit banks are connected to EURIBOR, the loan is made available by the EIB with an increase of 8 years, free of charge.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is promising - all of Europe is paying attention to the Balkan state mentioned earlier.
What, where, and who still buys the EU's most cheap market, but becomes more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is now the most desirable bottle for real estate purchases in the Eastern European area, with cheap ski apartments and houses on the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamproo and Vitosa are among the most popular, on the sea are Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sunkos", and the historic cities Sozopol and Nessebar are renters, but property around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly asked.
According to the estimates of Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, it is also possible to attract foreign investors earlier or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, as well as the famous valuable area of Russia.
The capital of Sofia also offers attractive offers - trade and office facilities offer the highest rates.
Bulgaria is the best way to become one of the most attractive European golfer paradises, and therefore to call in addition to the summer and winter season in the two other seasons.
Future investors are therefore already buying in large-scale style, for example around banksko.
Analysts are also seeking to change their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but also interested in France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and in the ski areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to drop down either buy revitalised properties for 50-100,000 euros, or downtown houses for 5-15 000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connection and accessibility and communication opportunities are greatly written, but also the proximity to a large city, business and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category consists of those who are looking for a holiday destination (Bulgaria was established in December under the German Top Ten holiday destinations).
The third group is made up of business people who invest with the aim of a medium- to long-term value increase.
Real estates in the capital are becoming more expensive, subject to growing demand.
In the EU, the real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the past five years, there has been a price increase of 21 per cent per year.
The tenement at the real estate prices is far above the attachment of the holder.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As environmental Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings on Tuesday are going to end, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by the Ministers on Wednesday after official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries advise on the Bali roadmap, which sets out the emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, following the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol.
At present, there is a strong debate between industrial and development countries.
The United States has already indicated that they do not want to negotiate on specific numbers, but they would be ready to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 per cent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other big question of the conference is whether the industrial states are ready to support developing countries both financially and technologically.
There was also an agreement on the support of developing countries.
The adjustment fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-head council, which is expected to be read in the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as in the Piac és Profit.
Six percent of Hungary
Environment Minister Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its priority role in global climate protection measures and to achieve a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (measured at the 1990s), whether or not the "Convention after 2012" would be successful or not. The Union would even be willing to apply for a 30% reduction if other major industrial states of the world, or developing countries, are also willing to fulfil their commitments by force and responsibility.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the target of the countries which joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was only 5.2 per cent, although the EU had already committed itself to a minimum of 8 per cent with its 15 Member States at the time.
The standard for Hungary is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1985-87 - a standard that will be fully met by the country, as in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The use is high on Bali - always the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would be safe to enter into force only after 2012, and in this case, the reduction plans set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow again, the international emission reduction system, which would also be the IPCC, the International Committee on Climate Change, which has been outstanding in its recent report.
This would delay the emission reduction, and the increase in earth's average temperature by more than 2°C would be inevitable, which would have been extremely difficult and irreparable consequences for scientists.
British Army acts on YouTube
British army units have published recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity at the video portal.
First, the British Aircraft (RAF) YouTube has discovered itself: in Afghanistan, stationed special units are loading videos on the Taliban's network since March 2006, reports BBC.
The recordings carried out on helmets are controlled at Kandahar Air Force Station and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
Political Message Unavoidably
Aircraft soldiers have already controlled 139 such recordings, their "canal" has been seen more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defencehead Quarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Peace Storms (MNFIs) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Use in Afghanistan
The air weapons have originally published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions also serve to inform the population about the actual objectives of foreign institutions.
Such propaganda has been published almost free of charge in comparison to conventional television programs, such as defence expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos are always a measure of political message, as they confirm the existence of military measures decided by the Government in their own way.
Americans compete with games
However, the army must also fight against amateur captures, which, in addition to carefully processed, deliberate recordings, also create a network - such as those that show the death of soldiers: In some secular, "official" propaganda films, they are spoken of the highest losses, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
From the war camps in Iraq and Afghanistan, many of the videos that have been used have already been uploaded to the platform, but the British have recently discovered them.
The Americans are trying to do something else, i.e. with the free downloadable game "Americas Army", in which the player can jump into the skin of the soldier in a more or less powerful live simulation.
Christmas parties with Tombola and Pogatsche in the ministry
Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth is not a cymphony: instead of a Christmas party, she organizes a work conference that allows her employees to compete with coffee and potash in 2007.
Some ministries celebrate live music, other beautiful Christmas party with Tombola or anstoss in the office halls.
Party, Christmas vote, concerts and buffet - so celebrates power.
The Christmas Führer has already noticed the nurse.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministry will be held in a place of defence, but the staff of the ministry will not be expected to do so.
At the "Water Night Festival" children will be awarded by fallen soldiers, at the "Mission Day" family members will be rewarded by the soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resource provides approximately 25 million for holiday facilities.
In comparison with other resources, the National Development Agency (NDP) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport agree on the strands.
The 4.32 million Forint for your Christmas celebrations of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will be held in the house of the future, and some 350 of the 600 employees will be expected.
Although the focus of holidays is on Christmas, there will also be live acts and a tombola solution.
The National Development Agency (NFU) has held its 4.7 million Forint Christmas celebrations on Wednesday at the National Justice Council (OIT) house, with concerts and a party.
The hall was 1 million Forint, the rest was distributed to more than 400 guests.
According to our information, a section of the IMF is also invited at another Christmas festival organized by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU farmers.
For the festival, the building of the playtheater ("Vigsínhaz") was rented.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the officials.
What's the point?
The OIT building was opened not only to the guests of the NFU, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball instead of a Christmas party on 7 December.
They had to pay no rent to the ILO for the use of the rooms.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The holidays were opened with a speech by the minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo] you told me: There was no ball dress or toy obligation on the ball.
The Ministry of Health, Work and Self-Management prepares themselves for Puritan celebrations each year.
The Ministry of Health organises the celebration for employees in its own four walls for around 400,000 forums.
Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth officially invites its employees not even to a Christmas party, but to the conference for the anniversary.
It is estimated that about 180 guests, who are thus awarded the press department - only with coffee and pogasche, attend the festival with 350,000 Forints.
Minister of Self-Government Gordon Bajniai will simply be held in the Ministry's Aula with his colleagues.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organises a Christmas party at its own festival, which is expected to be attended by 436 employees.
The expenditure was measured with 2,500 Forint per head - about this money there is a buffet receipt with subsequent advances.
Since the beginning of Janos Veres' office, the PM employees celebrate this way every year.
However, there will be no correct party vote - not only because of the official speech of the Minister, but also because the celebration was held for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites the 20th anniversary of a new year's reception, and this time the Christmas celebration of the Ministry.
The 100 guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városligt"); according to the source of the resource, the expenses are estimated by 1,000 Forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be very easy to accept the fact that foreign diplomats accredited only in Hungary are loaded.
The receipts that are held each year are traditionally started with a short speech by the Minister and are made with continuous shadows.
As the appropriate press posts report on [origo] request, there will be no Christmas celebration at the outside or at the Ministry of Education.
When asked about the cost of Christmas celebrations, the Ministry of the Environment could not provide any information at the press department.
In any event, more than 400 guests were sent to the event held at the Art Museum.
More and more forces mobilized for rice strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Federation will form their coordination committee on Friday for the unrestricted period beginning on Monday.
On Saturday a large protest meeting will be held, and on Monday, on the day of the public vote on the health insurance law, the work will begin to fall.
It will be calculated with strict, significant traffic barriers, as rail traffic is almost complete, and also the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) will be stranded up to 13 hours.
Details of the strike on Monday afternoon are shared by the League of Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions.
It will also establish a LIGA - MOSZ strike committee responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a large protest meeting will be held, and from Monday all organizations that have joined the strike will be down to work for an unlimited period of time unless they reach agreement with the Government.
In other words, the end of the parliamentary vote on the health insurance law was not defined.
If the National Council does not adopt the health insurance law, trade unions shall immediately withdraw the call for the strike.
However, if the law is adopted, the strike committees shall act together to advise on the further action.
In view of the National Council's agenda on Monday, it is even possible that it is only in the evenings, or even in the evenings, to vote on the health insurance law.
The strike that began on Monday will have to deal with major traffic barriers: the railways are lowering their work for an unlimited period of time, the morning is the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies.
At the same time, there will be more road stops in a direction.
The call for the strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organisations - the list of participants will be updated continuously on the League website.
Some organizations have announced strikes at an unexpected time, others planning a slowdown.
Until Thursday afternoon, there was no agreement between the Hungarian Railways MÁV and the free operation of the VDSZSZ railways, although there are more and more people on the train.
According to previous reports, the BKV will be extended by 13 hours at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 hours in the morning, the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy will be down to work for four hours, and the teaching industry will be busy. The democratic teaching industry has been calling for 2 or 8 hours.
The Hungarian Medical Association extends country-widely to different times, the EDDSZ, the democratic cooperation of the health and social workers, a subsidiary organisation of the SZEF, the Cooperation Forum for Trade Unions, holds a second warning.
The most important of the four points required by the League is that the Government withdraws the proposal for the reform of health insurance and distributes a new concept for social discussion.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will fall from next year.
Request number three indicates that the eligible professional groups will be already able to access the breakfast pension system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZZZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the supply lines of the Ministry of Transport and now requires a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increases state risk
In view of the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division) of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, with the support of the "Moving for a Better Hungary" in this August, have increased the risk of Hungary and the region.
In the Institute's Risk Warning Report, it says: In the context of the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "increasing of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Ziggeurs and the Non-Visual People in Hungary, which could lead to even a short time of violent ethnic austerity".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at the provocation of such a replacement, is that the research institute.
As reported, this will be seen as an ambiguity by the political leaders: "People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question left representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian agenda."
It is suspected that this will increase the problem, make the meaningful dialogue impossible, favour extremes, and increase the likelihood of violent exchanges.
In addition, the research institute believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard have not recently been affected by the enormous attention of the sides of the domestic and foreign media, "the image of Hungary is greatly damaged abroad, particularly as regards confidence in stability and democratic governance".
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and extreme right groups in Hungary has been constantly rising, and since summer 2007, several organizations called "national self-defence alliances" have been established.
"These groups are common to define themselves as a civil organization, while they openly appeal to their members to prepare defence tasks (Catholic protection, defence of the country, defence of order), under the responsibility of the police, the army, in relation to the State itself," it said.
And further: this is done in accordance with the method that tries to differ from the policy and participation of the population based on political efforts as a citizen initiative.
The identification of the civil character and the uniformity should therefore not be limited to the context of legal hearings which could arise at the time of the trial - it is a political strategy at the same time.
As the analysis is to be taken out, the activities of the Hungarian Guard also represent a high risk factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential danger source in several neighbouring countries, so some ultranationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see in the introduction of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of its own anti-Hungarian policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region" - it said.
From the point of view of the Institute of Research, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central-East Europe, so the political risk for the whole region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose foundation was announced by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
In the background of the establishment of the Bulgarian guard, the Roman mass excavators who took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the same event to allow for the establishment of the National Guard, with the argument that the aim of the organization of "national protection".
In your opinion, in the last 17 years, there has been a regular "shower terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained unhindered and independent - so Political Capital.
And further: The initiative would have led to a serious debate in the Bulgarian public.
As it has been said, the increased risk of ethnic hatred is also revealed by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to build their own guard.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities with the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not to be excluded that the Hungarian Rome also reacts to threats by organizing its own protection.
Attila Juhász, director of research at Political Capital, said on a news agency's request: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Annual risk analysis reports should be published and risk-changed trends should be recognised, the public opinion will be informed, as in the case of the issue of the risk report.
Holidays are not all holidays
In Hungary, holiday days are legally regulated, so the practice of the resuspending of the working day has been established around the time of the holiday, but the next year is less than that.
In the EU and America, there is something else under "Fourday".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and free working days.
Free working days are mostly church holidays, or are related to significant historical events.
For example, we celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are free days - the last only way to get rid of the Silvester fans.
All year round we have fourteen birthdays.
The State Day is the 15th of March, which commemorates the revolution of 1848, and the 23rd of October, the day of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August, the state foundation will be celebrated on 1 May, on 1 November and 2 November we will think of our dead.
In addition, there are every two days for Easter, Pings, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of the "Workday Disappearance" has been guaranteed in cases in which we would work only one day before or after the holiday.
However, the price of the extended weekend is that we have to work very well on Saturdays before, or go to school.
Where this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is to be finalised, it shall be laid down in a Regulation by the Minister of Labour for many years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employers, public employees and public servants.
Except for companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, including on holiday days.
The Rules of Procedure will only be passed on through the holidays of the year: Since 24 December, the lives of this country remain formal, since most of the days between Christmas and Easter are the same, or the holiday itself.
In the next year, more days fall in the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so that it will be made available less on working days than this year.
The calendar is first about the day of work "set on the head", so that people can stay at home for the same four days.
Saturday, April 26th will be a working day so that Friday may be a day of rest.
The second refurbishment depends on the date of the festival on 23 October: On Saturday, 18 October, you will have to work before Friday, 24 October.
However, the end of the year will remain in the mark of the festival, after all since 24 December, and will remain, even if Silvester falls on a Wednesday.
Six grueling minorities to raise colleagues
E-mails that we forget, messages that we never receive - harmless lies that will never happen to us again: they bring "color" in the workplace every day.
The question is whether you are accustomed to these small inconveniences, or you are better aware of the challenge and try to avoid this misunderstanding for other matters.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to inform you that someone called from the marketing department," said one colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
Most of all, you regret it and try to recover it, perhaps by calling on the marketing department and standing around, you would have forgotten to deliver the message (this is the least common method).
In most cases, the case has been dismissed with an apology.
Before you get involved in stressful situations, you should consider how you can prepare your colleagues for really uncomfortable moments and try to avoid these situations.
Is there something out there that doesn't belong to one?
There's hardly anything worse than if you get to a document, office, or phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the hardware was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost poet discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without question, there should be nothing left of the colleagues, because they will be greatly disappointed when they find that something is gone.
So, don't throw any envelopes or mail from the office into the pocket, because it could happen one by itself: nothing more if you need it urgently.
Was it about my colleagues' privacy?
There is no effective means to stop a tragedy that has already been put in the world.
Who's with him? What did he do?
Where and why?
You should not connect the information (or confusion) about the privacy of your colleagues as soon as possible to everyone's nose!
And if someone opens up and delivers us his inner secret, we should not waste this trust!
The best thing to do is move like a grave, instead of just not getting to the audience, even if others are aware of the problems of the colleague.
No cause of disease reported?
If you call in the office to report on painful headaches, because you just feel uncomfortable or just want to get out of it, you should be aware of one of the facts: your own work, unshipable achievements, projects with fixed terms should now be done by your colleagues instead of by yourself.
So don't play with your colleagues again!
If you already know that you will not be created in the office the next day or that something could happen, why you must stay home, you should report it right away so that neither the colleagues nor the chief are faced with the absence.
Summaries, cookies, phone calls
You're just deeply involved in your work, but are you suddenly disturbed by the fellow Members' latrines?
Did you hear a phone conversation that you shouldn't have heard?
You shouldn't let your colleagues talk with sums, singing, talking (which leads you through their heads), trampling, lasting scarf or nervousness.
This can be very disturbing, even though they are not just deep in a task (written, planning, organizing).
Is it always the other one's fault?
If a project is not completed recently, you should forget to send an important letter or important messages, you should not look for the guilt of your own guilt in others!
As far as possible, you should not speak to the chaos in the office or to the left colleagues!
The best thing to do is admit your mistakes and apologize if others were affected too!
The question of how to fix the error again, or how to keep the damage, is just too much!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Traininghouses and sleepers: Easy to go home, but nothing has been lost in the office!
Not even then, you should dress so low if it actually allowed the workplace!
Not only should we not be ashamed - we should respect our colleagues, as well as ourselves, that we dress appropriately in the office - if we want to, we should also be nice and elegant!
Everyone wants to be right - or how you're going to be interested in others
Stop and go traffic, the car is in the middle of the morning.
From the radio explains a rare melody: The sound of a brain, coupled with electronic effects.
I'm driving the volume higher.
The weather changes, the bass comes to the previous sounds, and as a true voice noise a woman's chor.
It's the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which explains to mr2.
The home music scene has not just been used for a long time with a qualitative electropop.
But now you see the scene different when you hear the new album from Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so often new and exciting production from the home digital underground scene, slowly contributes to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage rock with its guitar quits again "in", the domestic electropop proves: there are new things under the sun.
Balázs Zzáser has started in Pécs, musicd himself in the band Yonderboi, before he - perhaps because a factory doesn't represent two pfefers - begins his own way.
The break with his project (Zagar) and his music, which cools the elements from Jazz, electronics, and pop, created only when he was asked to compose the soundtrack into a film (e.g.
"Sezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, originally held in smaller clubs, was first known to the wider audience when the magazine "wan2" selected its first album from 2002 under the top 50 home albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, almost single, also in the western marketable trend set.
No doubt Zagar and his band were "trendy", but no one was interested in whether they would like to wear these brands as well.
The band has responded as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album that now appeared with the title "Cannott Walk Fly instead" could open new ways for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression came from the time when Baláz Zzáser was still on the way with another band.
The air-flying play would be fine, however, in addition to the essential character of the music, the – the spirit of time and the trend – the lower guitar, the influence of the Rock'n'Roll.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who works with the band "The Puzzle" in England, presented himself at the Millennium Prize.
A song from the album has even made it to the radio player - the newest from early till late pop music sent by mr2 Petzófi has the audience with the number "Wings of Love", which has been recorded under the influence of six domestic singers ("Underground Divas"), successfully set the watch.
It's all right, then (?).
The hvg.hu questioned at Balázs Zzzeger.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: Where do your music keep a certain layer?
Ballázs Zzáser: The term "Schichtmuk" doesn't mean much to me.
My opinion is that there are two casts in pop music, and although not Mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be soft and non-satisfied, but it can be produced only for the sale that makes it commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The recording preparation of the audience also works independently of language and country boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of your music from your Hungarian and foreign audience?
B.z.: In the country, especially in the western part of us, pop music has a larger tradition.
There are not only teenagers or Twins going to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that surround them, much more attention because they also hold them to a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public have in your work?
Is it important, who, where, how many of your music do you hear?
For example: Of course it's a good feeling to see that we are getting more and more to our concerts.
But we never made up for the market.
We do not create music to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is most impressive at the concerts, where there is already a mutual impact, but it is only in the inevitable changes of the moment.
However, one thing happened to me: If you want to do it all right, you are no longer interested.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on his way as a soloist and has built his careers in the west.
B. For example: We do not really go his way, even though you always try to interpret this into our music.
We see ourselves more like a model player who trusts the musical presence of the others and lets them disappear.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with Yonderboi were inevitable, since several of us came from his band and had taken another way.
hvg.hu: In the Charters of mr2 Petófi "Wings of Love" is a first star.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening with a slightly more popular style conscious towards a wider audience?
B. For example: We had no plans to write a hit that would then be held as a trainer for the album.
There's more to this song.
It was thought to be the final of the album, with which we wanted to solve the voices and the more difficult subjects.
hvg.hu: How have you chosen the six singers?
Why was she right, what was the guiding principle?
B. For example: The reason was to make a gospel-artic chor.
Then came the idea of bringing together the choir from dedicated soloists of the domestic music scene.
So the sixth head of Chor was created - so Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judy Jay, Bori Peterfy, Ennikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized later "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Are you sure you want to have the song, or have the girls designed it?
B. For example: The number was already in the instrumental version, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number was still "needs something".
The record of the agreement was formally requested after a vote.
I've got the melody in the same night, and later they've learned the girls.
It's got everything practical to help and exciting spontanus.
I can remember that I was quite electrical at the time, but it's already the divas.
With my voice alone, the song would never become so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the plate and at the concert, there was the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no Solo party (except for the short solo of Judy Jay), they have no own role to play perfectly together and are not more loud than the music, so their music will not only be accompanied by music.
They're back on the stage too.
Is that an intention?
B.Z.: Because they stood behind, it was because of purely technical problems.
However, we didn't want to let them have solo roles.
The number also means that you should forget your ego a little bit, forget who came and where it is going, let us just let us take this particular flight, the flight of love.
I would also like others to feel this euphoric condition that we have been inspired by when the song was created.
hvg.hu: What was the most impressive song?
B. example: In fact, there is no one in the musical work, it has given more difficult tasks to mix.
For example, at "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I played on a concert piano, or at "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the Groove no longer wanted to work, but after and after he added everything together like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number from the new album?
For example: This is changing with the concerts and even now where I have the album "lost".
Currently it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Deprived Maclers are at risk for low-valued billions
Landless miners
This is what his former employees Jerome Keriel of the French Bankeries Société Generale, owner of this Komerční banka.
She came on her way to almost five billion euros.
But it seems even more so that Kerniel was just a big player who wanted to do the same for his colleagues, and he was certainly not in a position to do it.
Unlike all large banks, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He's more mentally weak," was to hear from the mouth of his predecessors who showed him to the police.
But as made out of the remarks made by the French media, for example the daily newspaper Le Monde, he was a man who had achieved EUR 1.6 billion by the end of his last year with his business gains.
Crisis not just in America
"All I wanted was to earn money for my bank," he claimed in his statement.
In the summer, he was able to earn half a billion euros in the US crisis.
The opportunity to do so had been delayed at the beginning of the year.
In February there were first news that so-called sub-prime hypotheticals, such as those with low income customers or those who had already had previous payment problems, would be given in difficulty.
But this crisis should not have an impact on the whole economy.
A lot of people didn't believe that and kept their rights.
During the year, he had earned up to 1.6 billion euros.
"Even if I had earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Kerviel continues, saying that he definitely had nothing to do with himself.
During the entire hearing, he says he's been missing documents so that he won't be caught.
He even managed to lead his boss behind the light, even though the Eurex Towers were generally interested in his business.
Risk profile
He was afraid to fly?
I don't think so.
"I thought she was satisfied with the bad fact that I deserved 1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to develop his position progressively.
He joined the Société Generale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at Lyon University.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a painter, and in 2005 he became a self-sustained painter with a yearly amount of $90,000.
However, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"I should have known during my first conversation in 2005 that I was watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Keriel explained to the research officers.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the Allianz shares, he earned a lot by putting a half billion euros on short-term losses in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll let you go
"It's like a snowball," he said to the police.
But the chiefs apparently knew of everything, and they did not.
"As long as I earn money, you close your eyes."
But then the great tribulation came at the beginning of this year.
One day he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to figure it out.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer a bank employee.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros on its way.
And how did they get him on the stairs?
He was suspicious of his vacation.
"I only took four days from last year.
A painter who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want to be looked at in the cards," said Kermany in conclusion.
Chechnya has the chance to reach 365 billion
The Czech Ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed nine development programmes yesterday, which the Czech Republic can reach 14 billion euros (about 365 billion dollars) in the coming years.
This is about half the amount that the Czechs can receive from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
Some 125 billion dollars come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive some 100 billion crowns from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flow into the transport industry.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and includes up to 22% of the funds that can be obtained from the fund.
This amount is increased according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have over 90.8 billion in next year.
The "Company and Innovation" programme should help entrepreneurs and companies to earn money for innovative businesses.
The companies should therefore receive funding for the introduction of new technologies, for enterprise research, and also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
In the previous EU funds money acquisition, Czechs among the new accession countries are still at least successful.
Nicaraguan Court of Justice confirms twenty-year sentences for Presidents
On Thursday, a court in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year sentence of imprisonment for former President Arnold Alemán, which was sentenced to 100 million dollars (about 1.8 billion dollars) for financial fraud in 2003.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his garden in the Nicaraguan Metropolis.
Whether the former state capital (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state comes back behind guitar, the news agency AP is currently unclear.
The President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, will now depend on the authorities whether Alemán is allowed to leave his sentence at home, or whether he must be imprisoned.
A court stated four years ago that Alemán had regularly transferred the government’s money to foreign companies’ accounts in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts were actually part of their associations and most attachment.
Some of these money finally settled in a fund that Germany had set up to finance its 2001 election battle.
The budget is in progress.
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is valid.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget proposed by this Government and the opposition was adopted without the support of the coalition majority.
For the past year, with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats), the Minister of Sobotka (from this party) was still authorized, and the ČSSD was therefore unable to approve it.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion for a motion for a resolution against the Government, nothing was dramatic this time.
The House of Lords observed this traditionally little, yet the most important law in all peace.
That's definitely a paradox.
Everything begins and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the budget, whether or not one likes it.
The budget is a key component of policy, but is covered by the power struggle of the government and opposition.
This is an appreciative subject for the media, and therefore they pay more attention to him.
A conflict among politicians is much more interesting for the public than for the numbers below.
The state-owned holdings in previous social democratic governments are below three points that the budget for 2008 cannot be eliminated at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure charged by law, where it is not only about interest, but also about social expenditure, which has been decided by the "sustaining" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (communists) in the last year before the elections.
The second is the definition of budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third restriction is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the Communities.
However, the greatest risk is not the state budget deficit.
This budget is publicly and in some ways under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the communities.
Many mayors gave in addition to taxes, charges and bank loans to create additional sources for investment, often unsolicited debt claims by which they owed their owners in excess.
In recent years, they were able to repay these debts through massive sales of shares of energy and other supply networks that they had received in the course of their privatisation from the State.
Now this source is already secured.
As long as we stand only on official and verifiable facts, we find that:
our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years, like the rest of the world, where the ČSSD is growing apart.
This provided a single opportunity for their governments to arrange public finances.
Instead, these governments owed the State more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have a much more meaningful economy than our Republic.
This is a giant scandal that is mainly to be written by the former governments.
We belong to countries which are at the global level at least at the risk of poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes that have just been overflewed in the last few years to a huge extent.
Even if it has been achieved to cut down a part of the insignificant populist expenditure that was adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if it does not come to a disbursement of the pension fund and to a pension reform, then virtually every policy in this country will end, and, as far as the power is concerned, it will not remain a pure administration.
It is only easy to pass on when it is said that then it will become officials of the ruling politicians who mechanically share most of the tax revenue on interest and social expenditure.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but only the destruction of normal expenditure can be covered by debt expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion dollars proposed for 2008 would have been excessive if previous governments had not issued in the last ten years, which was just going on.
If we do not really want it to become a clean administrative office from top politicians, we must be patient and not too strong by this coalition government, which is aware of the fact that the state can only spend as much as it can on taxes and taxes, we want peace in the preparation of further reform legislation.
Only these will allow a gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to deal with crises
The US Federal Reserves, the European Central Bank and the Central Banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the crisis in the financial markets together.
Thus, over $100 billion will be obtained through auctions on the currency markets.
On these auctions, banks increase interest rates to which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the U.S. Fed sends $40 billion to auction, and 24 more to the European and Swiss Central Bank.
It is the first time that the central banks of the individual states, following the accession of 11 September, agree on a coordinated procedure to reverse the effects of a financial crisis in relation to the reverse.
"This step will eliminate the greatest difficulties of the economy, so the growing lack of free capital that banks can afford," wrote Bernard Baumohl in a report to his customers from the Advisory Company Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of the Central Bank has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65% to about 50%," said Baumoul in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unencumbered loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect more billions of losses.
"The central banks must have been really worried about what could still happen when they decided on this occasion," said the chief economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks have the fear that if the banks themselves have a hard access to loans, they will also be more valuable to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and reduce the US economy in a recession, possibly with effects on economic growth worldwide.
The central banks have decided to do so after they have not been able to do so, to withdraw the LIBOR, the London Interbank rate used for the loan between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to lend money to each other, while the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom had reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a further decline in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the Reuters Agency.
Some analysts believe that this step of the central banks contributes to the elimination of the crisis, because it does not solve the fundamental problem, and although the case of the real estate market in the United States is the case.
Class: The debate of the ecologists is unbelievable
Global climate change is said to affect most developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now came to the end of the UN International Conference on Climate Change on Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, Not Green Planet", he pointed out that the debate of the Ecologists was hopeless.
It is therefore unacceptable not only the structure of the conference, which constitutes a rare mix of government representatives and such non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric they accompany and the reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word-fire, which is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed that his book was very important to him and that he was so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation, because "I often look at the cartoons of my views."
Now interested parties could therefore continue to read his setting unambiguously.
Klaus reminded himself that he was not a climatologist, but he had his opinion on sufficient conditions to write such a book.
Finally, he was academical, capable of understanding and evaluating professional transactions, having experience with statistics and also with economics.
As the main subject of the book, he referred to the theory that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are so normal that there is no consensus among scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not too serious and therefore pose no threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate are excessive, ineffective and unacceptable.
In addition, he held it as someone who had experience with comprehensive systems to impose unconfirmed views on others, viewing it as a dangerous restriction on freedom.
On the questions of residents, he once again stated that he was not against "a reasonable protection of the environment, but against militarized eco-activists who do not take a look at the relationship between waste and waste."
Klaus had already spoken on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people couldn't change their leadership
600,000 car drivers missed the deadline to change their old leadership, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day on which you can apply for change so that the authorities can create a new leadership by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers are travelling on the streets without valid driving authorisation.
As a result, the authorities have largely not replaced those who no longer want to drive.
While small places report a strong decline in interest in the field exchange, the mayors of the capital will be overwhelmed with requests, and the interest in the exchange will grow this week.
The city administration produces around 2000 customers every day.
You have to stop for about half an hour.
In Prague about 140000 car drivers have not changed their driver's appearance yet.
The exhibition lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shorter period of five days.
In this case, the driver must pay 500 kroners.
Automotive drivers who do not create the proposed exchange until the year and leave without valid driver notice shall be punished with a fine from January.
The double rate pays up to 2000 kronen.
However, the police can also be used with a reminder in the transmission.
In the case of a transfer, the penalty may rise to 2500 kroner.
According to previous information, those in the Community may also receive a penalty which does not at all carry out.
He could have suffered a penalty of nearly 30,000 dollars.
The Ministry has already called on the officials to put up peace and to impose at least a fine of 1000 crowns.
The speaker of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, followed a thousand-kron punishment.
The driver appeared to be a document where anyone could decide whether or not to own it.
It does not have to be a personal way, everyone, and even a valid one.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up their leadership.
It's enough to bring him to the competent community office or send him by letter.
During the year, leaders were dishonest, which were issued between 1964 and 1993.
However, drivers may also have to exchange other types of driving skills.
People with leadership skills from 1994 to 2000 have more than three years for the exchange.
The validity of leaderships issued from 2001 to 2004 ends in December 2013.
As a result, Hanzelka is about 2.6 million more leaders.
Justice lower punishment for detectives who were tied to Berdych
The former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Konıřík, who are accused of having done things together with the band of David Berdych, received 13 relatively 10 years of imprisonment.
In a judicial judgment, the Prague Supreme Court decided to reduce its punishment in a way that would reduce it by two years.
Initially, the detectives of the "Amit for the Fight Against Organized Crime" were 14 years of age and older.
Against today's judgment there is no job option, only revision at the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also accused in this case, but he is the first to be tried.
In other processes, however, he had been sentenced to 16 years in total.
He can't be condemned anymore.
In January 19 the District Court said that it was primarily responsible for the participation in robbery cases, and today the Supreme Court negotiated the profession of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants argue at first with the argument, it is a construction case.
As a result, police officers, including Berdich, transmitted information from police sources, covered various robbery incidents and half of the members of the band to avoid prosecution.
The band survived Opava and Konıřík 30 percent of the beet.
In the case of the accused, it is the penalty of the band from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, cases of robbery, often caused by serious injuries, but also by the use of weapons and unauthorized possession.
In domestic investigations, the police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel, laser fire and machine gun.
The band has been able to reach millions of crowns due to its robbery.
In addition to almost 20 men in this process, Justice Berdich and a number of others were legally convicted because of other rapes.
Other men from the area of Berdych have to be responsible for another process, other cases have not yet been brought before the court.
Tomáš Póta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish port and are waiting for the final decision on their delivery for prosecution in the Czech Republic, have been terminated.
Children Replaced - Account: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a connection clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, from the hospital in Trébić, wants 12 million crown damage plus court costs.
For each of the mothers every three million, for the fathers every two million and for the children every million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondréj Dostal, is therefore not fully in agreement with the proposal of Velebas.
"One such proposal is that it is too high," Dostal said after today's negotiations.
"But in order for us to have an opinion on this counter proposal, we need the ideas that made the opposite side.
We'll find out if it's ever made sense.
But we are in the view that this should be for everyone in the hundreds of thousands," Dostal stressed.
The amount should move between 100000 and 200000 kroner for each of the four parents.
At first, the family from Jablonov wanted a million crowns for every month that they had not taken their biological daughter.
For Veleba serves as the basis for disbursement negotiations a thought that the university hospital in Prague Motol had developed for him.
The parents of children experience psychological damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depth.
Men trust the stress situation better, even if they have seen prejudices against them, they could have prevented the conception of newborns.
The women come back with the effects of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is just going on, Veleba determined the content together.
Veronica and Nikola were transferred to Tříbič's hospital last December 9th.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Príbiyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jablonov.
The district head of Vysočina (Böhmish-American High) transferred 100000 dollars to each family at the end of October as a substitute for expenses incurred by the hospital in Tříbič, which supports the district.
All hospitals in Chechnya are protected by laws because of their obligations.
In the event of doubt, they need to be taken to a reserve fund, but they can only request assistance from the carrier.
The courts have reached similar low levels of injury, which have been determined by tables and have moved in the area of hundreds of thousands, except millions.
Polívka came about his kingdom in Nwanache
Bolek Polívka lost the battle on the brand "Kingdom of Nanachai".
The judge of the District Court in Ostrava, however, used the name "Walachischer King" first, but the project had built a team for Tomáš Haribish in collaboration with the actor in the years ahead.
Polivka did not take part in the negotiations today.
As a result of his attorney, the case is not likely to end and his mandate is probably to be appealed.
"The struggle is that Mr Haribish and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívkas parasitaire," said Polívkas lawyer after the negotiations.
All presented themselves with the words "Walach Kingdom" just this actor and comedian.
The same opinion is also Arabic.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Money creation and concepts of activities," he said.
As a result, he's in charge of money.
"After years they have found that the project is successful and that they may have something of it.
They want to win parasites at our work," he continued.
Lukrative business
Polívka then used the name "Walachi King" for the first time in his television broadcasts.
In 1993 the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý hired him.
However, this did not at that time go along with the intention of justifying a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Haribish came to the thought of giving the Nadaki passports.
A business and entrepreneurial activity was crystallized from an original spacious action, then the construction of the company "Walach Kingdom" was joined by the Habish.
In 1997, Polívka agreed on the use of his name and signature in the steps and even offered comments to her owners when visiting his farm and his theatre.
Who's gonna sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also pointed out that Harabish used only the idea that Polivka had made in the "manage" message for his entrepreneurial views.
"The popularity of Polívkas has certainly helped the project of the Nahuatl kingdom," the judge said.
However, she added that the soul of the project was Harabish and his team who had dedicated themselves to him.
The cooperation of today's warring parties lasted until the year 2000, when the official crown was organised for Polivka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, the conflicts between Polívka and Haribish have begun to arise, which appeared in the phrase "King Boleslavs I. selected until the day of the Sankt-Numbererleins".
The governing role then took place at the invitation of Haribishs Jarmila Šuláková as the Queen's mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Haribish and his company against the court today.
Clearness in the fight could bring about the war of Haribish's war on the throne and a half princess.
There should be a new king.
He didn't want to talk about details and a term.
"We don't want to miss anything.
There should be something like the King's funeral in the Nwanachei.
The king should be selected for a certain time.
Mr. Polívka can also register quietly," added Habibish.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Missing advantage
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
His driving properties were not very valuable, the quality of driving, linking and also processing could be described as more moderate.
But now his successor, Peugeot 207, is on the market, and he is much better.
The Kombo with the name SW is still a piece, and I'm just going to review my opinion.
When I had tested the classic hatchback of 207, I had to complain for example about the low headness on the backsides.
These complaints are now no longer there, because the compass series of the Kambi is designed so that no two-metre man will suffer.
Next
I'm just going through the interior to keep me from going too far.
It's a very successful design, where I'm only affected by the carefree middle tunnel.
I'd like to have a little more designer design where the car is so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and there are times when we may complain of too short seats or headaches.
The page content has also improved significantly against 206.
With regard to the range offer, you can also see here the increased dimensions of the cartserie.
In Kombi, the already mentioned lack of headache is also eliminated.
Coffee in the coffee room
But the main thing about this car is the loading room.
I have to refer to it (also because of the docking window) as very convenient and space-saving.
The halls are equipped with upright windows that represent an ideal compromise.
They do not interfere, allow each other to withdraw and also hold more difficult objects.
But we'll keep it through the load volume.
It is based on Tables in the basic equipment 428 litres, which is a higher average value compared to competition.
However, not compared to the most sold vehicle in Czechia, this class, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we note that the peugeot remains in a clear range of 52 litres.
This value is already critical for an abroad holiday or when you invite a child car.
But in order to highlight the positive, I still need to mention the very flat loading area or also the very low charge.
120 PS in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a fourrzylinder Benzin engine with a Hubroum 1.6 litre and a service of 88 kWp.
And honestly, it should look like a 1600-kubik engine that drives a family hackback.
He's lazy, has a low consumption and gets away well.
If I compare him to his opponent at Skoda, who sometimes seems to be hiding his trigger with a lamp, then I can only be impressed by him.
The price list is speaking about bonds
The price of this car is not just popular.
But we need to remember that we have tested a well equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400's petrol engine is still rising from 329900 kronen.
With our engine, it costs 410900 kroner, which is already quite a lot.
The Premium of the Test Car is also recommended once again with 80,000 crowns in addition to book.
However, we had headlights, automatic air conditioning, automatic disc switch resolution, electrical window lifts and...
The car costs 531900 kroner in total.
This is a lot, but once you count the additional equipment of a Fabia and you will arrive at a similar sum.
So only the decision that you want to choose will remain.
The integration of Slovak students into British schools is not achieved
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, leading to the domestic anxiety about further development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europe has so far resulted in a number of obstacles.
British schools even identify cases where disputes between immigrants and children of the original inhabitants are to be fought against violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where the gap between native and Slovak immigrants is growing.
Streets, skiings and railways among students have been transferred to the relationship between parents.
The situation has developed so far that the police in Chatham found a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with a iron rod.
The accused defended himself to the effect that the young man had defeated her with racist remarks.
The police also had to attack two minor girls on a Slovak immigrants after an attack.
The girls had apparently made racist remarks against the man and cast him with stones.
"When we went home, a young man knocked on a bus and jumped on us.
When I told him he was going to stop, he kept us with apples and bees and then broke his bed," a mother of Slovak students of the newspaper The Times described another unusual incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the natives even referred to the struggle with immigrants from Eastern Europe as survival.
The cases mentioned indicate that the voice between natives and immigrants in British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In Britain 70,000 Slovaks have been reported seeking work here.
About 30,000 Slovak students are visiting British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful Caribbean island
For visitors it is really an island of freedom.
What you always expect from your vacation will be fulfilled if you only choose the right one.
Gold and white beaches, high waves or a sea, which is quiet like a rabbit.
Palms and All Inclusive with kellners that offer on the beach Pizza, ice and contaminated cocktails.
Kitsurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you can find that in sufficient measure.
Only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the great hills.
By the time of Spain, Cuba was their base for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place you've ever seen a human eye.
Havanna first became a warehouse or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had stolen in America and then transported to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The National Hotel was created at the end of the 20th century.
Building was one of the heads of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during the ban) was pleasantly seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havanna, houses grew up, over the wide boulevards were cars that were counted on the cult symbols of the fifth century ago.
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate in San Francisco de Paula, near Havannas, and he was in Cojémar.
At the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havanna you can also leave your autogram.
At the bar at the National Hotel you can mix Cocktails completely as you wish.
And the cultuatos of the fifths are still here in Havanna, because the first imported schigulis and Fiats in the salt and cool air have been falling apart for a long time.
Mag Havanna, especially his oldest part, has come down strong, nowhere you can find as many wonderful colonial sights as right here.
Other places are just released, for example Trinidad.
In view of the urgent need for tourism, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifty years, not only new hotels have been established in Havanna, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba also offers a marot that is unique to the world and is especially targeted by railway lovers.
The sugar syrup from abandoned plants brought steam and the same-run smelting powders to the sugar factories.
Her farm has not been renovated over decades, and so you can see beautiful and fully functional Lokomotives, whose elderly guests are standing in the museum for a long time.
Destination
The most important places do not leave the majority of Cuba's visitors.
So you don't have to write about Varadero or Havanna anymore.
It remains to mention that in the already mentioned site of Hemingway, there is a museum whose visit should not be left by those who may be the author.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corner of Cuba.
The fertile vegetation grows on Calcutta soils.
Mogotas, Kalkhügels, and the rocks, sleighed from the valley floor, gathered fertile soils, which are also covered by dense vegetation.
This valley is where the best Cuban tobacco can be built.
In his final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havanna's cigarettes.
It may also seem interesting that there was the Chilean consequences of the television series "Major Zeman".
Trinidad
An old town, which was founded shortly after the Spanish colonization of the island, was founded.
Peace and riches brought you trade with slaves and sugar.
The rich lived in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed over the past four centuries.
Trinidad, situated between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that there was no road in the last fifty years that would have been connected to the rest of the country.
This isolation suggests that it remains unattended.
Nothing was built there, but that's why it didn't take away anything, everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more time for Trinidad than one afternoon, you will have to look at interesting places in the environment, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the "number of sugar factories".
In the evening you should go to Casa de la Música, which lives after the darkness, and where music does not move until morning.
Baracoa
Some of these cities are described as the most beautiful island in the East Cuba.
Surely this view will also be influenced by the way there.
Both roads led by Guantánamo have to overcome high and circular mountains and pass through a landscape that is nearly affected by human intervention.
This eastern post of Cuba was adopted by UNESCO thanks to its unique nature in its world record.
There the best chocolate is produced, in which the church shows the cross of Columbus (in fact it has occurred about a hundred years after the journey of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the present-day Hotel El Castillo, is located, is to see several tables of mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous one.
About the coffee, the Roma, the Zigarans, the Sierra Maestre Mountains, the Swine Book and the Isla de Pinos Island, the Tropical Cabaret, the Holy of Cuban Patron Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves are familiar, many pages could be written.
But, as you say, it's better to look with your own eyes.
Associates in Afghanistan are passive, popular Americans.
Few soldiers and lack of necessary equipment affect the United States following the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should, in accordance with the words of Minister of Defence Robert Gates, design a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not run according to its assumptions, and in Scotland, representatives of the countries were certain that the units in the south of the country were stationed.
In addition to the growing opposition of the Taliban, the eight participating States also discuss further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its defence minister Robert Gates, is increasing its activity in NATO units, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan Government and in intensifying development aid.
"In Afghanistan, a forward-looking development is fragile, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part of it is to enable the inhabitants to start a further development of the economy and security itself," says British Minister of Defence Des Browne of BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels has reached the highest level of five years after the U.S. Army indicated.
The number of violent acts has increased by 27 per cent in the province of Helmand, even by sixteen per cent, compared with the previous year.
NATO countries have stationed some 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of which are located in the southern territory.
As a result, the United States has been founded on an absolute border with regard to the organisation and equipment of the units.
In particular, they call for additional hijackers, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the specific goals for the next time and about the way and how we can achieve them," said Gates.
Similarly today, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop appeared.
"I am not satisfied with what we have in Afghanistan for countries and in the air.
We have about nine percent of the soldiers and equipment we need," said De Hope of the Reuters agency to conclude three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, among the countries involved, there is also debate on whether all allies in Afghanistan are giving their best.
For example, due to Passivity, Germany was criticized.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," said Gates.
The British "Sun" boulevard this week called the German soldiers Faulpelze.
"Afghanic Non-Smoking: The Germans make games while our boys fight," wrote the Sun in an entry supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing the table.
The German image magazine went through and printed a picture of a British unit during a Rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to a billion high-speed in 2009
On each check a debt of 84000 kroner.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion by the end of September.
The government had planned to lose 159.2 billion women this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of public budget policies.
The debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion by the end of September.
Within the first nine months of this year, they are about 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen to 13.4 billion.
Thus, the Ministry of Finance confirmed its statement on State debt in early October.
On each check there is a debt of 84000 kroner.
Over the last year, the state owed more than 111 billion dollars.
"To date it seems that we will only be able to exceed the limit of a billion crowns in 2009 thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year.
Next year the debt should be moved between 900 billion and one billion dollars," said David Marek, analyst of the Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimir Pikora, analyst of the Next Finance, says: "We could be over a billion in 2009.
If so, it depends on the next budget we don't know yet.
If it should be shown that the situation at the political stage changes, and the politicians should be more prepared to save, this could last until 2010.
But from such a change, I do not go away," he noted.
Growth of debt
The State debt is the debt of the government, and is mainly the sum of the deficits of the state budget.
The State debt shall be financed by credit, public debt, direct loan or, for example, by the European Investment Bank.
This year's domestic debt rose to 719.4 billion dollars.
The foreign debt of the state is currently about 1.7 billion dollars to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable State debt reached €803.3 billion at the end of September and fell to 13.7 billion since June.
The average case of state debt rose to 6.5 years.
"The total debt rose over the year from the first to the third quarter by 13 percent, which is really much in view of how good the economy is.
It is interesting that growth is to be recorded primarily in debt transfers, where growth is 20 per cent.
It is bad that debt increases, but on the other hand this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes," Pikora commented the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the state debt treatment for 2007 suggest that the government had planned to collect 159.2 billion dollars for this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion dollars, thanks to the better development of public budget policies.
This amount refers primarily to the state budget deficit, which is expected to reach 76 billion dollars this year, instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
It is also the maximum planned funding for the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion dollars, a ten billion reserve for the payment of interest, the financing of State debt transfers for 43 billion and the financing of loans to the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
Because she gave a name to a Teddybearer, she was brought to court today in Khartum.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher who was charged in Sudan for the persecution of Islam was sentenced on Thursday evening by a court in Khartum for 15 days and a subsequent divorce.
The British was accused of having allowed six-to seven-year-old students to give a teddy bear the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophets is forbidden.
She would've deserved to be fired.
After the parents of students complained several times at the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary school student who was active at the Unity High School of Khartum was arrested on Sunday at home and charged under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code of Conduct of Islam.
In fact, this matter takes place in September when the teacher asks her six to seven-year-old students to find a name for the classenddy.
The children hit eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, told school leader Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class ends, 20 of 23 children choose Mohammed as the favorite names.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic Prophet, but above all, one of the most frequent examples in Sudan.
Next, the children have created a book for the class, with the picture of the bar on it and the photograph of My name is Mohammed .
The bar itself did not bear this name, but the problem is quite simple that the representation of the Islamic prophets is considered to be a consequence of Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who taught at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew her well, and she would never have done anything to bring her religious faith closer to me, I only regret that she had prayed to the children to vote for a name, but in his view it was just an innocent mistake.
An opinion that tells the many students of the teacher who describe them as very careful against their students and as a person who never talks about religion in the class.
It is thought that the first name Mohammed is also the second most frequently given name in Britain, for which 14 different letters exist in English.
This often chosen name by Muslim families is considered a kind of honor to the prophets (which is often given to the first-born of a family).
But how do the rules apply to the use of this name?
For example, can you give him a toys?
This is of course a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, at the last negotiating session in Vienna, there was no agreement on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo spent Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last discussion session without being able to overcome their disputes over the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not agree on the status , said the European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that the peace in the region was at stake, his American opponent Frank Wilsner Belgrad and Pristine urged him to comply with their obligations to achieve peace and to continue the discussions on the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and pointed out that there are major tensions.
End of the proceedings on 10 December
The media of Troika, which unites the European Union, the US and Russia, will meet once a day in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province, inhabited by 90% of Albanian speakers, could be clearer if it reached the UN Security Council by 10 December by Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiating session since the last August of the United Nations had been commissioned to receive a new communication.
Americans and Europeans are expected to complete their mediation mission on 10 December.
The Russians who had already blocked Kosovo's independence in the Security Council were on the basis of further negotiations on this end.
Russia was and remains the speakers of a negotiated solution, an acceptable solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After Kosovo has been under UN administration for eight years, Western countries maintain independence under the supervision of the EU for the only solution to the future.
Pristinea is ready to give a witness on the one hand if the Security Council does not decide on its own interests.
Belgrade consists of stronger autonomy
Unfortunately no agreement could be reached , the President of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo Rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, shared his fears.
However, he added that the proposed plan for the autonomy of the past, which led to killings and deportations, was part of the proposed plan by Belgrade.
Domino-Effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, on the other hand, felt that a compromise would always be sought, and warned the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence in the province.
Belgrade believes that there is a particularly "domino effect" in a region which is still so weak by the independent wars of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation agreed that any decision would be taken solely and solely in the Security Council, where their Russian allies had a veto right.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word
Only a decision from the Security Council series is acceptable for Serbia, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica explained.
These negotiations have lasted for two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council.
The journalist Fatmir Sejdiu replied that the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status and added that every unilateral declaration of independence from the Albanian-speaking people will be issued in accordance with the Western countries.
Bush unlocks an agreement between Israel and Palestinians
At the opening of the International Conference on Peace, which had gathered in Annapolis, Maryland on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israel and the Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final arrangement of the 60 years of old disputes between their two peoples.
In the case of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a peace agreement before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructure and Israel must set up its colonization work, Bush explained, reminding both parties of their obligations in view of the roadmap for peace, which it agreed in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian concern under Abbas were to seek a peace treaty, which should clarify all open issues without exception, including central issues.
This name includes the three serious problems that mainly address the conflicts between Israel and the Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the state of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who were displaced during the conflict of 1948 from their homes in the state of Israel today.
After the American President, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the negotiations would be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provide for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
On the other hand, when Olmert took the floor, he committed himself to conducting the forthcoming arms-related negotiations directly and without interruption and that he would try to make it possible to end before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of his vision of two states , a Palestinian and an Israeli who are next to each other for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has indicated that Bush has received assurance in this regard from Bush before it decides to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has led a plan taken by all Arab countries in the way that Israel offers peace, in exchange for its return from all Arab territories that were occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis is a shadow road in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central point of view, the Saudi-Arab prince in his interview with the Saudi journal of Arabic-language.
In the eyes of the state authorities, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this kind of local news, official versions and smells are against.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the findings of the National Discipline Authority of the Police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 17 hours, a police car was on the Rue Louise-Michel towards Williers-le-Bel.
He had no use, but he was on strike, and he was 40-50 km/h, without bluishing, explained a police speaker.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without permission, so not released for public traffic (see below), came, driven by two young people without helmets, with very high speed.
It broke the left side of the police car, after it had been damaged by the process of law, a policeman continued to say.
The alcohol control performed in the passenger cars is very negative.
The condition of the vehicle (red-and-drift cots, broken windscreens, broken steels) is indicated by the severity of the lifting.
Very quickly, early in the morning, the state officials of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that the IGPN had entrusted it with an investigation of the "acts of the infamous murder and the lack of assistance to persons at risk" in accordance with the main public security guidance of Val-d`Oise.
On the afternoon, following a press conference, the state officials explained that they excluded the IGPN from the police's responsibility at this stage.
According to the Magistrate, three witnesses of the accident that were heard on Sunday evening confirm the police's version, namely that this small force wheel has reached its left hand relatively quickly.
Yesterday showed a sort of rolling, certainly caused by the lifting of the floors on the ground, that the two vehicles were intertwined until the police were able to brake it.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical observation.
The bodies of the two victims were obsessed yesterday.
What's going on?
Yesterday, in Williers-le-Bel, a mob quickly made the rounds, so the police had left the accident very quickly, without the help of the two young men.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also exclude any serious errors.
A police source follows this is a difficult aspect of the findings that are necessary for further investigations, and where it must be carried out very carefully.
Liberation has hit a sign of this little moment shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows, he had a direct look at the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to live her again, tells this witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely destroyed police officer who stood up.
Two more tried to live again, one of the young, who called the fourth.
In view of the tension that had quickly formed about the incident and, as it seems, because of the uncertainty that the present people had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers of colleagues who had been caught in the accident were taken into the car.
Still speaking of this witness, the rescue forces arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
They have also used heart massages, but they have left.
I'm not going to let it be claimed that police officers had not been able to help young people.
You've read this young man's first help.
The fire alarm has arrived right away.
It was done everything to try to save them, on the other hand emphasised the state attorneys.
In Pakistan, the pressure is rising
On Monday, the Pakistani police shot down the first demonstrations since two days before General Musharraf was expelled from the emergency.
As a result, there were about 2,000 lawyers in Lahore City in the east of the country, who were protested against the measures taken in the context of the emergency, and were injured by the train forces that used the control forces there.
They ran into it with stones that they hurt the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios took place in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police lawyers attacked and injured.
Several would be provisionally established.
In Islamabad, the prosecutors of the Supreme Court of Justice called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of approximately 500 arrests of opposition, human rights defenders and lawyers during the week.
Monday morning the roads leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations had been found in Multitan (Mitte) and Peshawar (Northern).
On Monday, the opposition received support from the religious parties united in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president urged the people to send flowers to the judges who had spoken against the need to send flowers and the wastes that had been committed before Musharraf.
Musharraf promises no longer valid
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special action announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to refer to the legality of President Musharrafs again in a direct election on 6 October.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was seized and dismissed.
All we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court , the chief of the newspaper The News.
Pervez Musharrafs promises to give over the army and become a civil president no longer valid since the call for emergency, the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said Monday.
It was expected that he would issue his military uniform until 15 November, the date on which his first term of office would end.
The Minister for Information has also confirmed that the elections of January could be moved.
In addition, the Pakistani government demarcated the country's sincere complaints that President Musharraf would have received a place of residence from his deputy leader.
Still more than one third of pregnancy is not planned
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as the ill-planned or unexpected births.
Also today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed the prohibition of collection in France, is not planned by three pregnancys (36%) as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ind) shows.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as the ill-planned or unexpected births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of the collection ban, such as the pill or spirals, still show a loss rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, the percentage of pill users between 20 and 40 years of age who use pills has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, however, the liberalisation of the collection ban has enabled a better control of fertility.
In any case today eight of ten births have been carefully planned.
One out of five couples even calculated exactly a month, and, if possible, in the morning, the age at which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his cameras from the possession of the International Space Station (ISS) have been used for over seven hours in the world to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector that is indispensable for the continuation of the scientific work at the station.
A waiting rise, due to its duration, the removal of residential modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools built by the astronauts to carry out the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem arises on Wednesday, when the astronomers had downloaded the Harmony module from the spacecraft Discovery, a large silver-shaped part, which will soon take up the European and Japanese scientific works.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module labs.
But you need to be able to provide them with electricity.
The second task was to implement a 17.5-tonnes heavy module for electricity generation over solar collectors already located on the ISS to put it in its final position.
After moving it, the effort was made to restructure the solar collectors of the module, with a span of 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, who let themselves fall out like accordions, was damaged by a wire attached to a length of about a meter.
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collection sector anymore.
The astronauts who originally left the spacecraft Discovery for a control course and then repaired another solar collector whose rotation system was defective should be forced to turn to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to take a space to carry out the repair at the end of the 30 meters away from the space train station.
He's one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very sent, he has a well developed body and long arm.
So the 46-year-old doctor was chosen to operate the affected solar collector .
After paying close attention to the damage, he emptied the wrong cable and fixed a sort of skiing on the damaged site.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who remained close to the lock, and, from inside, from the other astronauts, under them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey switch, with insolator, to prevent the solar collectors that have built several hundred volts to prevent an electric hit, had the astronauts on board the station.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully released before he counted his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of rest before seven astronomers returned to the spacecraft Discovery today, apparently to take the flight back to the earth in the middle of the week.
The title of the EADS assigned to the bear
After the Group announced air travel and defence that it would have to be issued between EUR 1,2 and EUR 1.4 billion to counter the A400M's return, the EADS action currently shows a significant rise in the Paris burden.
Currently EADS 4% lose to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was obliged to review its business forecasts for 2007 once again with regard to the slow progress of the A400M engine which slows down the flight of the aircraft.
The costs announced in October to offset the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amounted to between EUR 1,2 and EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than a billion for Airbus , were announced by the parent companies of the European manufacturer EADS.
In view of these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operational targets (EBIT) for 2007 on Thursday, when its four-year performance is presented, without further details.
The Group also notes that the assessment of the new costs is linked to the six-month return.
In order to remember that the business performance of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, due to the delay of another programme, the costs associated with the very large A380 passenger aircraft.
The group originally intended for the first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The selection mode of the quintuple
On Sunday it will not be exciting when the polling is done: the mass of Russians will be decided for President Putins Party, United Russia.
After a very successful election struggle, it confirms its efforts for stability, even for authoritarianism.
Three days before the elections, the Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed a message to the voters, who have already been registered, but whose content will be kept secret.
He does this in his own capacity as a top candidate for the United Russia, the Pro-Kreml Party, for which he announces an overwhelming victory.
Yesterday, the President had nothing to look at when he received the foreign emissaries, and he was pleased to deliver a new point of opposition to the powers of the West to be accused of joining - his favorite theme during the election fight.
We know the price of true democracy and hope for fair elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without compromise, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they left.
It triggers a struggle of pressure-affected choice.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that it would never have given such bad choices, not even in the time of Elstin.
After the repression of the demonstrations last week, former prime minister Gary Kasparovder was sentenced to five days' imprisonment, according to his lawyer's continued refusal to visit.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovietus
Following these parliamentary elections without delay, two further questions are raised:
Who will be the next president of Putin?
The Official Journal announced yesterday the date of the first election of the presidential elections on 2 March 2008; the candidates have been informed by 23 December.
Since he has been elected 2000 and has been re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin is not eligible for a third term.
And now there's no trace.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Will the President of Parliament and the General Party of Russia be elected by the Government and the President?
Whatever it is, at Parliament's elections or at the presidential elections, the previous power will be triumphed.
That's tradition.
The Russians have maintained the mentality of the Homo Sovietus, they are not the Lord of their destiny, meaning sociologist Lev Goldkov, director of the independent centre of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov from the State University of Sankt Petersburg goes back even further: the civil society has evolved in this country, which has been Christianized for five centuries after Europe, only gradually developed; the famous Community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin again pointed to the model of a state of patriotism, which was fully adopted by the people, so much more, since this new patriarchalism did not follow terror, but a certain economic prosperity, Mary Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians are neglecting the personal responsibility they have placed shortly after the fall of the UdSSR.
How long will it last?
This phenomenon concerns all social events, including the business world.
And the executive secretary understands the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) lead the local voters of the United Russia.
The new freedoms from the West are often as significant as Chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians are not even voting for extremist parties.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: How long do they last?
Those who are in authority are not so bad, why do they then turn away?
A Hard Mind
After more than 60 years of confidential treatment, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, documenting the massacres of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely available.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which have been placed on a total of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be seen until now, whether with a humanitarian purpose, individually or by name, so on the question of a previous victim or of its members.
The eleven States, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, with their administration, agreed in May 2006 to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
The access of the historian to Bad Arolsen will allow research to be carried out, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the concentration camps and the health status of the forced workers, Reto Masters, director of this archive, managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, have been able to make these names available to the public because of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the spiritual obstacle of some deportation victim.
After the war, the concentration camp lists or the court orders issued by the Gestapo were brought together for a practical reason: to find civilians who were deported or forced to work, and to provide them with evidence of their detention, if any, to find their way to their destruction.
Still today, there are more than 300 personal requests in Bad Arolsen.
However, a part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in accessing Bad Arolsen.
There is no basis for expecting any new information in these documents, Dr. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre for Anti-Semitism of the Technical University of Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India want to achieve a free trade agreement in 2008.
The trade between India and Europe is already reaching the 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India's most important trading partner and makes 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said that the European Union and India would hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
EU Foreign Ministers had given the European Commission green light last April to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asian).
The EU is India's first trading partner and makes 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade package will significantly advance the two economic areas and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million Europeans, Peter Mandelson confirmed.
Europe represents the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products in India, the European Commissioner further stated that Asian and European giants, between EUR 47 billion per year in the value of € 10 billion and services in the value of EUR 10 billion, had stated this week Danielle Smadja, President of the European Commission's appointment in New Delhi, and regretted that the potential has not yet been exhausted. The EU and India will meet their eight diplomatic members in New Delhi on Friday, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President José Manuel Durao Barrosso of the European Commission.

The Bank of England accepts the promotion of knowledge and offers 10 billion dollars for five weeks.
The Bank of England expressed concern on Thursday about the current repeated demand for credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion dollars with a basic rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with unusual running time.
In order to reduce the fears resulting from the conditions in the financial market at the end of the year, and to give the banks a greater knowledge of the way in which they are to organize their liquidity positions at this time, the Bank has the intention to provide a significant part of their savings during the delivery phase which begins on 6 December, in the form of an open market operation for five weeks.
The Bank further states that, on 6 December, 12.15 GMT 10 billion (EUR 14 billion) will be brought into circulation, on the basis of the tax rate and only until 10 January.
This is apparently the first time that the BoE in an open market operation brings liquidity for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its communication that it intends to take further measures to obtain the different interest rates of the interbank loans from day to day with its basic rate of interest.
From day to day, the difference between bank interest rate was 5,829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate has risen to 6.6%, somewhat higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis from the summer, the sums brought into circulation by the Bank of England have been linked to penalties which the banks had refrained from taking into account.
In view of the fact that there is some reason to believe that the development of the fund course, in contrast to the euro, would lead many to sign for the sums brought into circulation by the European Central Bank, to benefit from interest rates and with safe discretion.
UMP and NC intend to examine the proposals of the PS for purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the article of the socialist legislative proposal on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
The text of a socialist initiative (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group) included about ten measures adopted by the National PS Committee on Wednesday, of which the majority of 50% of the employment benefits, the reintroduction of the TIPP fleet, a transport check or the award of contracts.
After UMP and NC had voted against the examination of the article (180 votes against 115), the sitting was resolved after the main discussion, which was partially heated exchanges between majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television share on purchasing power.
The director of PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the legislative draft for the correction of the funds, which was examined by the Assembly last week.
A new festival is born
As a result of numerous complaints about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vienna Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the British producer Melvin Benn Festival.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who has served as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones of C3 shared with Billboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vienna, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from August 8-10 on a 500 Acre large private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The leader of the Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most famous festival producers.
In 1989 he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracted 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added his portfolio to the Leeds Festival, and then, in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also taken care of the production of licenses and the organizational tasks of the Glostonbury Festival, which is currently up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, described as the most inspiring event in which he has ever been, says that his company and Melvin Benn work alongside each other to offer a festival event in European style in the area.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and work hard together with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We held negotiations with the city and the Commission were motivated and encouraged by this project.
Unfortunately, we have stayed in police debates with regard to the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
" Luckily, we were able to discuss with Melvin Ben and prepare for a great festival at an extraordinary place that will finally be welcomed by the people."
C3 Presents have reborn the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 in the Grand Park Chicago after it was profiled with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the festival world in 2002.
The two events were able to reach $9.8 million in 2007, respectively, and $11.8 million.
These two festivals take place in urban areas.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, although the poor are more at urban grasslands," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to mix these two concepts together in one way or another in order to communicate at the same time the impression of a rural festival on the European and a city in the American way."
Vienna is about half the way between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Community of Vienna, including the mayor, takes over the burden of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
Finally, it is encouraging to appreciate the terms of the agreement, but it confirms that "they are quite interested in investing in such an event and taking up a festival that is expected to have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very great" in about 80,000 people at Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing was confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer beautiful rock, but music will be very numerous, hoping to attract all kinds of visitors," says Charlie Jones.
His partners from C3 who received the top independent promotion price of the last Ballboard Touring Awards are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal hits the terminal.
It is not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if there is no lower than the terminal.
These lock tests are part of the delegated tasks.
A political "heikles Mandat" because of the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who starts "Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to deal with the governor?
"I have to be careful because it's the industry that decides where it comes from.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are cheap, she will go there.
Our role is to provide those who care for the best," he says.
The run on the festival.
For Denis Turcotte, however, it is now the highest priority of the present cinema.
The hunt for Oscars has begun.
At all festivals at the West Coast, while the Sundance, which is from Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, is going to present the films from Quebec, evaluate them and ensure that the producers have interviews.
The dark weather had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the plaque in Santa Monica and is presented on the 30th Star of the Winter Film Festival in November.
This month Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute.
Is the bear a year-old casualty before? Unanimity in the experts due to the US hypothetical crisis
With almost five weeks to the end of the year, the investors are already moving their hands towards the coming end of the year.
However, experts cannot create secure forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that the month of December in the bear normally coincides with a positive market development
However, it is not advisable to make forecasts short-term and only on the basis of statistics. Especially not when serious efforts are made to determine the current market experience.
While other experts do not welcome such a strong rate in the last weeks of the year, they still note that the exchange rate is determined by the given market liquidity and market participants. These invest mainly in interest funds, which are largely affected by the current trend of assets.
As a result, according to these experts, there will be a further later trend of market changes, especially since we cannot yet assess the extent of the possible decline in the US note bank's interest rate, a uncertainty that is mainly due to the rising oil price and the risk of the increase in inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, president of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a waiting time to announce a leading market-rally.
The chances aren't very good, the experts assure.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4 % since its highest brand on 8 November of 15.945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could, as a result of the restructuring of the investment fund and the traditional, each year, take-up of the interest rate rate, which could successfully end the year with almost 16,000 points.
However, the expert points out that this year could develop something different, especially due to the already in the second week of December, and then directly after the Brussels day of the constitution, which takes place at the end of the year-Rally.
According to the analyst, price changes would not affect market trends.
Based on the assessment of Federico Olucha, an analyst at the Bank of Invers, the previous market evaluations at a close technical level could lead to a difference from the index values, which could initially be attributed to the consequences of the US hypothetical market crisis.
The analyst is confident that these will turn out to be positive.
In selecting the values that will move the Ibex to a new maximum, the analysts agree.
Solana by Intermoney means this year the big values are on the line.
The experts would count the two large banks and some real estate companies as the electricity sector would be expensive at the given time.
In the meantime, Federico Olucha from the Bank of Inverss ensures that the increases are combined with the banking and industrial sector.
If the Rally actually fits, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been on a stand-alone course in recent months, and we hope that other real estate companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will join the same way, as the expert.
With regard to increased consumption during the Christmas day, the market situation will be determined in the last half of the year of the periodic consumption.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technologies will also achieve positive consumer results, even if they are only represented in a small number on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December showed only two cases of short-lived courses.
At the end of 2003, the technology bottle led the bears out of their crisis and began at the same time the last real end-year rally.
This year, in which Ibex 35 rose by 28.17 percentage points, December showed a rate increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will result in the fifth year of winning (Ibex has risen to 8.36% since January) and can also be seen as an end-year rally.
Popular will open its 200 credit institutions from Monday to Friday 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernise a large part of his branches.
In total, 200 of them are located in the most economically powerful regions of Spain.
For the institution operating under the brand name Popular Max, these discounts mean a large milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, since Popular as the first banking group represents the spring time to extend the opening times of its branches on weekends to 20.30 a.m. and to set a total day from 10 a.m. to 20.30 a.m.
The BBVA Bank Group, which has also re-examined the extension of its opening times in the Netherlands, has not yet adopted a definitive resolution.
The ongoing negotiations between the bank and the trade unions seem to be reaching agreement, with 75% of all branches being closed daily and open on a Sunday afternoon even if not for the customer.
Whether further banks join the new initiative that adapts to business opening times will depend on the experience values of the Popular Bank.
And that's the idea that the popular pursues with its project.
The aim is to extend the opening times of the branches, which, because of their status, can be identified by large purchase houses, the customer's own, small and medium-sized enterprises.
The Bank wants to open the new 200 duplicates within the next 18 months, as it is not new but modified opening times.
For this purpose, the Bank will redesign the spaces of the discounts that are already in business zones and will at the same time adapt them to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the expansion of the opening times will be linked to a new space design of the branches, which is characterized by a more modern, colorful design.
The competent bank representative Ángel Rivera ensures that the restructuring does not require more investment, but with increased staffing, a branch now needs no more than six, but eight or nine employees.
The discounts even equipped with additional space for SMEs will not be sold for financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tried his concept and nine branches in Madrid.
And the values of experience are positive, so Ángel Rivero.
The lowerings of the streets Bravo Murillo, O’Donnell and Gran Vía have been chosen for what seems to have been a dark decision.
The population currently manages about 2500 discounts.
And 60 more who operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized on immigrants and also show extended opening times, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the model of BBVA is not used, since most of them are offered a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to show competition for our customers, says Rivero.
With telephones, they agreed to sell their mobile phones with the help of external bank staff.
The Spanish Private Telecinco doubles its value for the first time and thus overcomes its rival Antena 3.
We've made it.
With this sentence, the business leader of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, was able to satisfy his satisfaction at the end of the season. The sender led by him had increased his value to the double of his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, touched his joy: That is exactly what hurt me; not that we had a higher growth, but that we had fewer losses, he fixed it.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they were not too deep.
Telecinco ended the day with a plus of 2,54% last night.
This profit reduces its previous annual losses by 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company's value is now reached at EUR 4,488.88 million, with mediaset controlling the capital's main share (52%), and Vocento is only participating in 13%.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1,52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, making it a market value of 2.193.46 million to half.
On the contrary, the market value of other marketed communications companies increases; in the case of Sogecapable, 3,571 million, in Prisa (from Cinco Días magazine) in 2,518.53 million and in Vocento, 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be denied from the fact that it is about two similar companies, so Vasile.
Unbeknownst to me, the question remains, to what extent can we actually act in a cost-effective manner, to what price and how we can design it successfully at customer level.
Telecinco declared his intention to increase this year to the first television channel with more than 1,000 million gross profits from advertising revenue. This was guaranteed by Guiseppe Tringali, the business leader of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the advertising company of the group.
If the project should be implemented, the sender would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6% from the previous year compared to 965.4 million.
In the case of Antena 3, the net rate rose by 1.6% in the first nine months of pregnancy (up to 734.4 million), while net income from the television business could only be increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for the better flow of telecinco is that the analysts at the high payout ratio that the company was able to show up to this point: in 2006 the company led by Alejandro Echevarría carried out a 100% dividend protection.
Vasile, however, ensures that after buying 33% of the shares of Endemol, with mediaset as a parent company, the ratio could still vary even if it is too early for an official notice.
We are obliged to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have already given much more.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already been able to increase by 33% of the endemol shares.
According to the analysts, the market is currently experiencing certain losses.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced his profit calculation at Telecinco for this year by 4% and 7% for 2009.
This is the result of a reduction in the projected growth rate, which will be reduced from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This also accounted for the expected profit of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5% and 7.5% for 2009.
3 Options.
It's the first time I've ever seen.
Ibersecurities: set on its high efficiency and sustainable potential and therefore recommends buying both shares.
It's not like I
Caja Madrid: lost Telecinco (purchase) due to multiple incentives and the prosperous market a more favourable position in the case of Antena 3 (holding).
It's not like I'm here.
JPMorgan: recommends that, in view of the similar threats (increased market and worse economic climate), the expectations be restored in both cases
The Congress agrees with the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel to Parliamentary training, which ended today with the Convention decision in the Senate on the proposals for the project to be submitted, the Government published the provisions made under the new law with a view to enabling the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously commended the efforts of the Congress and Senate bodies, who had pursued the objective in their negotiations and votes, to establish the best possible arrangement to ensure the safety of investors and to regulate individual entrepreneurs' activities in order to ensure such a general and efficient market experience.
In addition to modernising the financial markets, the MIFID, which establishes the securities service Regulation, is pursuing an improvement in the investor protection, the increase in the regulatory requirements of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive enables specialized companies as well as natural or legal persons to provide financial advice and also contributes to the creation of new financial services companies (ESIS), consultancy companies which are associated with investment and mediation companies of securities.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, thereby adding regulated markets to the multilateral systems of the business and the systems for the internationalisation of trade matters which would end up competing with the current economic operators.
The Law obliges investment firms, the focus of their company's profile, the confrontation and the forms of risk management on the market and all projects carried out to facilitate their control of CMMV.
The Committee on Economic Affairs of the Congress made further changes in the context of the decision that, due to its high level of risk for the investor as a complex financial instrument, the US mortgage and bank crisis has confirmed itself. (US mortgage crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal entry into force of the working areas of diplomats was adopted 30 years after 1977, which were limited to the working areas reserved for economic scientists.
On the other hand, the Senate established new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic mediator working on foreign account, which does not require authorisation from the CNMV and cannot offer its services for the marketing of products and for the acquisition of customers at the same time more investment firms.
The harmonised consumer price index (VPI) was increased by five tenths in November and is now at 4.1%.
The indicator to be used by Eurostat for assessing the inflation rate within the European Union is the average price developments in Spain in November.
Its publication complies with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which seek to compare local and quality data with US products.
The forecast for the indicator can be made provisionally by applying the same method as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of the calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) held that the indicator previously identified should not only serve as a reference value and therefore do not comply with the final outcome announced on 14 December.
The consumer price index (VPI) will continue to remain at a relatively high level
Following the statement by the Deputy Head of Government and Economic and Financial Minister Pedro Solbes, the increase in the IP in November was a temporary development; at the same time, it ensured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
However, in the halls of the congress building, Solbes stated that even if the current number is not good, Spain's inflation difference to the other members of the currency union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also stated that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, in which the government did not expect such a high rise.
We expected a value of around 4% , the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs announced today's public forecast.
Virgin calculates over EUR 42 billion in the next three years with Northern Rock
The values of Northern Rock have fallen by more than half, after the Bank had asked the British notation bank for emergency credit in September last year, and they are still only 12 000 million pounds (equivalent to EUR 16,800 million).
At this time, the bank's assets are recorded as 25,000 million dollars, a sum that has been significantly lost within two and a half months by the loss of confidence of customers, and despite the government's 100% guarantee that the money will be safe until the end of the crisis.
The Virgin company, which would continue to run the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, needs about a quarter of the British banks' income that will be set up there in the next three years to acquire exactly the $18 billion that is still needed to achieve their goal of 30 billion.
The multi-billionaire group Richard Branson, known for its recent advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, aims to allow 50,000 million dollars (about 70 million euros) annually in advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named this week the Virgin Group, where three other companies are involved, as his preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for suspected involvement in urban corruption
This morning the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular) located in Murcia, due to the pressing suspicion of urban corruption that was detected this week.
In addition, one of the Secretary-Generals of the Council and the head of the Community Police were also appointed.
José Martínez Andreo was appointed last May by the office of Juan Morales, currently president of the People's Party and then President of the Council of Totana, and could be the original driver of the complex according to information provided by Cadena SER.
Officials continue to examine the business documents of the Community and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not conclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales was accused of the main suspects of urban corruption discovered early this week.
According to the information provided by the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular, and thus privileged Commissioner Juan Morales was appointed to leave his mandate on the basis of important binding documents that should be related to the whole.
In addition, other sources of information from the various orders of Morales are reported to a Galician construction company which proposes the conclusion of a city construction contract in which the construction of a 200 hectares of large area was decided.
There are currently eight persons in the investigation area.
Bono agrees to accept the application of the PSOE in Toledo and, in the case of a voter, to attend the convention.
Former Defence Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, and is therefore taking over the list of PSOE candidates at the next general elections in Toledo and, in the case of an election of the Socialists, the Office of the President of the Congress.
José Blanco, an organization secretary of the PSOE, and Bono, announced at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero took place at the party's headquarters today.
In the view of the Head of Government, the offer to the former Minister has been justified as it is important in politics to be able to count the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, the policymakers from the Mancha would, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the upcoming elections, all appear to be the president of the Congress for the Party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as president of the Congress, who had announced on November 15th that he would no longer join the next general elections to finish his career in public policy and instead put himself in the university field for climate protection.
The former Minister had to conclude that the President of the Government had repeatedly pressed his return to the political scene two years ago.
In addition, he pointed out that the party, as in the appointment of the vice-president for the economy, did not want to prevent citizens who would take over the posts of the President of the Congress in the event of a vote, and referred to this as an act of transparency.
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to turn the room into a house of respect and not the exercise or the cry, so that it will always appear to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time, the impression has been made as if the only place in Madrid where you cannot speak peacefully and leave is the Congress; the President of the Government in the Senate has been interrupted up to 26 times.
At the same time, he commended current President Manuel Martín and his good work and pointed out that he did not want to give up the opportunity to have the office already, since his political opponents would otherwise call this arrogan.
Climate Change
Since climate debate is subject to unambiguous criticism by both the partners of the climate change as well as those who have a social and political debate in this regard, the movement must be a strong link to the day as a whole.
In particular, when it comes to a leader of the movement, as in the case of President Zapatero, the fight against climate change is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
This proposal, however, makes it clear to him about the trade and non-handling of his Government, which has helped him to make it clear that Spain is within the EU at the top of the countries that have met the Kyoto Protocol's standards at least.
Who are responsible for the non-compliance with the standards on which sectors to implement this, and why did his Government, which had proposed the agreement with the planet, not stop this development?
In addition, he is now forced to present to the Spanish citizens the measures envisaged by him against climate change without any interference.
What companies will be affected by the changes in the behaviour of citizens, what individual and collective savings measures must be taken and what economic consequences will result from them.
It is said exactly who has to sacrifice and will be paid for the salvation of the planet.
However, it has and there will be no such statements in the future.
It's just because it's about the sacrifice and the payments.
Because the measures that can really be used against climate change are undesirable.
They are expensive, uncomfortable and dangerous to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the Benzin-Cent proposed by the PSOE appeared to Zapatero strategically view it as dangerous that he was forced to withdraw the proposal again.
Similarly, now it is appropriate to save the planet with nothing, so with pure propaganda and empty speech without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, Commission, committees, protocols and new officials.
With its agreements with the planets, the other politicians must not speak out for election campaigns, complain, or demand, but rather follow the demanding expense, admire the meetings and encourage others with their sanity and goodness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not differ from its purely virtual nature and does not suggest that the bike will become the only means of transport in the future, or that we can only refresh ourselves with a faggot.
The mayor and police chief of Totana, due to a dramatic development in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has established the mayor of the town of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local police officer, the secretary of the mayor and a hotel entrepreneur for the alleged suspicion of urban destruction, took it seriously today.
The city court was established at its residence, from where it was brought to the community office, and in its premises it is still present, surrounded by numerous agents who were also involved in the city administration and in the municipal construction of Suelo Industrial y Vivinda.
The three arrests are related to the detentions already held in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, where more than 2 million hectares of unclosed urban construction projects are to be restructured under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria. These should be built on the basis of 4000 dwellings after the local administration has reached illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested directly, but a investigation procedure was initiated and executed by the First Court of Totonas.
The first six arrests have been handed down today to the judge.
Following the statement of investigation, Juan Morales, the former mayor of Totana and currently independent PP, are also exposed.
Further, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current, resident friend in Murcia, is under suspicion.
The president and holder of the Nuaria Group , who was a lawyer and entrepreneur from Vigo, Manuel N.A., was appointed in the place of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the manager of Suelo de Inmonar Pablo José M.G., whose company was to act as part of Nuaria and receive the cash.
The findings shall be carried out by the municipal authority against urban delicie, under the supervision of the Central Unit of Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, carry out 11 further investigations, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rosas (Madrid) and Totana.
At this time, only one person was found in Totana: the owner of a regional known poultry business, who should have acted as a mediumman.
The construction group Nuaria was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in Murcia, which should include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
In Totana, the company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometres that it was supposed to build. The aim was to implement a construction project that would affect the population of the community to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking places of the streets Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activities are limited to the direct market sector and Preconiza, specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.
Things that can happen
I'm sorry.
If you agree to this, we will be able to hide from the expression book of the month and instead try to find a price name for other names with appropriate competences.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are warmly invited to submit your suggestions.
It's not like I'm here.
Our Finnish Correspondent explains to us yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, the Helsinki Sanomat, a comment (Finland is at the top of the PISA Study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper on 18 November; in the case of that day, its issue included the criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of the philosophy fax has become after the tragedy about the school of Jokele the subject of the public debate.
Responsible for the brutal murder is an abiturant who quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
The President of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, asked the teachers, in an interview of the daily newspaper Helsinki Sanomat, to take a more critical position on Plato and suggest that the doctrine of Platonism be removed from the teaching plans for the Philosophy to Gymnasian.
It's not like I
A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. The download of a member would be a legal breach which would take place in six months.
However, if you drop a music business below a value of 400 euros, this is only a simple mistake (Article 623.1).
B. If you drop the business up to a value of EUR 1000, then the theft will be as a criminal offence, but the punishment will fall less than in the case of a download (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you close a car and return it forty hours later, then the penalty is still less than in a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less difficult to participate in a striker than in a music data exchange.
In order to participate in a rebellious detention, a prison sentence of three to 12 months after its death (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the data exchange has a six-month term of imprisonment for up to two years.
(Article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. According to Article 184(2) of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at work is considered to be less serious than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films whose authorisation has not been granted by the author will be subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film materials to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague should have the right, then someone's demands have been very good.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
My Hausarzt gives me a long, rare research article with the title: money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially if the others get more of it.
Thus, the feelings arising from the monthly payment are dependent on the content of the colleagues.
The study was created using a Tomographic Magnetic Reference Analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the latest edition of Science magazine.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner heart research center Life&Brain, the activation was the strongest when the participant gave the correct answers and, however, split his players.
Researchers were able to realize that brain activity was always very moderate when both participants were right with their answer and then achieved the same content; but if one of them got the double, it also became a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it really requires so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The state of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been indicted for eight years after the Balkans war crimes. Her office is in the state administration of the former Yugoslav Criminal Court, located in La Haya.
Her mandate will be launched at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a smiling and laughing eye, as the main responsibility of the Srebrenica Massacer - with the massive Bosnian Muslim movement about life - is still at the end of the ex-General Ratko Mladic and former Serb-Bosnic leader Radovan Karadzic.
Their names are listed on the list of the director Marcel Schüpbach from Switzerland as a presentation for the title of his documentary film La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet in Spain); a film that, at the time of a police prosecutor, follows the Swiss state officials from Belgrade to New York for their purposes, to raise the proceeds of crime and put their governments under pressure, in order to make their networks easier.
What insurance is best for me?
The CFZ insurance covering a possible accident caused by the driver includes a high cost expenditure, which is also dependent on various factors, including age, gender, time of creation of the driver’s appearance, family status, type of car and its use, etc.
To own a car is only the beginning.
Because it is even harder to find the appropriate KFZ insurance than the proper vehicle model.
First, we have to be clear about what we have to do here.
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurance undertaking.
This Agreement shall be set out in writing by means of an insurance agreement, which provides that the company receives the said insurance premium and is obliged to submit, in the event of an accident, the corresponding amounts of the proceeds.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance consisting of several factors, such as age, sex, time of creation of the driver’s license, family status, type of vehicle or use.
Insurance undertakings set their prices according to the statistics, so that, in the event of a higher accident, they will also be subject to higher contribution payments.
For this reason, both over 25 years of age and women must pay less contributions, as statistics show that these groups have a lower rate of accident due to their caution.
The same applies also to married persons, since they are less likely to suffer as a result of the statement of the statistical values and therefore also after the company's conviction.
The benefits associated with the vehicle affect the frequency of driving and thus also the probability of an accident.
The more frequent use, the more likely the damage.
When setting up the premium, insurance must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also thoroughly study the situation in order to choose exactly the car insurance that meets his personal needs first.
We now list the most important points that should be taken into account in the choice of insurance in order to meet not only a useful but also a pre-sorientated choice.
The 25-year-olds are faced with the choice of a cost-effective insurance on numerous obstacles, such as low driving practices and young drivers.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance policy to close a comprehensive insurance policy, there are still more valuable alternatives.
The precautionary driver can choose a full bag with self-sustainment so that the services of full cash insurance are covered, but are offered at a low price.
This type of contract includes that the customer must pay part of the amount caused by the damage itself.
The amount is fixed before the end of the contract and through the amount of the insurance premium. This is the lower the amount to be paid , explained Luis Noguera, Spain's Chief Representative at First Europe, an online insurance firm.
Another option is the extended insurance that ensures customers against external accidents, but not the damage caused by their own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover the loss of fuel, fuel and vehicle.
Here's a council.
If you are under 25 years of age, it is in your hand to reduce the insurance costs; so your salary increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A subscription is a reduction in the basic rate in the relevant insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty includes an annex to the tariffs.
The high rates of fines and fines depend on the company and its revenues.
If the company has a rewarding year behind it, it can allow itself to increase the bonus payments, explains Noguera.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for the driver to conclude a contract. This is why the fact that the rate of accident is low with increasing driving practice.
Thus, it is most appropriate to decide for full-time insurance with self-employed persons.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, either in the event of an accident or at the time of driving, the Spanish president of the European company explains and adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner has been removed.
However, it is advisable for a married customer who does not have children to conclude a full-time insurance; of course only if it allows the financial situation of the person concerned.
By the insurance agent, couples with children are treated as customers with the lowest accident rate, and thus their contribution payments are lower.
In this case, full-scale insurance with self-insurance (with an amount of EUR 300) would be the best option. In case you have received a high refund, it is recommended that you have an increased insurance that is used only for the third year of the vehicle.
They are generally more relaxed and possess a greater purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera notes.
For Rentner, it is proposed that full cash insurance be made with self-insurance (at a amount of EUR 150) or conclude an extended insurance which is used only in a sufficiently high amount.
Finally, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accidents, but also because it generates high costs, which require a basic choice that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgov hopes in Milan on the point for the background
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will fight the point that they lack in order to achieve their respective goals even before the end of the Championships. The Italians need the point to reach the tops of their group, while they decide on their participation at the stake.
The Italian men already have five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with an exception in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgov with nine points still needs another to ensure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not contain Befia Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as the FC Mailland must attend the FIFA Club World Championship in Japan, where it will be fought for the first time on the 13th in the semifinal for the first time around the entry into the final, which will take place on the 16th.
Thus this group will be closed in front of everyone else and the difference in the Gueseppe Meazza Stadium to the expected result, even if both teams are tried. The Italians will not be speculating at home, the Celtic Glasgov will know that they would have a victory group leader and would thus have a better starting position in the eastern end.
The men of Gordon Strachan could even have a lower position at a FC Shakhtar sleep to qualify. However, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because at nine points the Ukrainians are equal to the participation; the last week had lost (2-1), but they were able to win the second game (2-0).
Thus, the Mailmen will try to avoid the shots at night. They hope to reach the back end of the redesigned champions’ league for the second time, after they have been hit in the previous game season in exactly the same round by a tower of kaka in the next game time (1-0) and by a zero-to-zero discrepancies on the game.
While the FC Shakhtar waits for the victory of the Rossoneri, the man will have to focus on his own game, as both the achievement of the final and his membership in the UEFA depend on his victory and a fall in the Celtic Glasgov.
In spite of its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the greatest European masterhood, Benfia Lisbon could win the third place and therefore play at UEFA.
20,000 people visit the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls gave the Canadian Vancouver audience of 20,000 observers for their first tour after the release of the band in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Gri Hallwell) soon before the beginning of their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver stadium, the mood in the reunification band is excellent.
In order for 20,000 people to live in the dedicated stadium, a video about the band’s history was shown at the end of the nine-year period for Furore.
The reunification and the world tour are intertwined with the publication of a new album, which includes its largest hit and two more new songs, headlines and voodoo, which appears in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden bracelets that had previously been given to them by the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the fans in the audience who led the GM Palace to rejoice, although the nerves of his marriage Victoria had forbidden him in the days ahead.
While preparing for the show Victoria Beckham released that the British Star did not have to face our guardobe alone, and that is why I am already quite tired of what it is going to take from the scene.
Sports Spice , whose exit from the group in 1998 was due to internal differences of opinion two years later the group's resolution came to an end two hours before the concert was expressed at a press conference.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world's public had changed, that the feelings of the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I wondered why I didn't actually; so I'm glad to have made this decision, Chisholm went out to the separation of the band she had made nine years ago.
The singer also suggested that the disputes were resolved and that they were all very happy again.
However, many things have changed since the last joint event of the Spice Girls in 1998.
For the first time, the group was introduced to a special machine of Virgin Airlines in Vancouver after the television transmitter's CTV report.
When they arrived at the airport, the band was received by a gentleman from a child girl.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will be held as the next in California, San José (on 4 December) and Los Angeles (on 5 and 7 December).
In Madrid on December 23, they will take part in the stage.
New Fears of Earth Gas Conflict between Russia and Ukraine
A new price struggle between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe will be affected.
The majority of Russian land gas exports to the European Union (EU) will be directed by Ukraine and every conflict between the two nations will be closely monitored.
Kiew has previously warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for the gas it has to pay, it will take into account higher transit charges from Russia.
A previous conflict between the two countries in the last year reduced supplies to the EU countries.
The most recent conflict between Kiev and Moscow takes place at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian, state-owned gasmonopol gasprom are trying to reach agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine has to calculate more, as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional to land gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for imports of gasprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit countries in conversations," said Ukrainian Minister of Economics Anatoli Kinakh of the Reuters News Agency.
"The changing earthly gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transitional taxes [after Western Europe] over Ukraine."
In the last major global gas struggle between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut supplies into Ukraine.
This led to a case of exports to Western Europe, which led to prices dramatically high.
Russian gas is one fourth of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas markets, but many of them remain under development.
The result is that Gazprom complements its own products with gases from Turkmenistan and other Central Soviet nations.
NHS "Check foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service has to improve the control of the pre-trial register for workers outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation of chief financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor was brought to Scotland in conjunction with the approach to the airport of Glasgow in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish State Health Service does not have any specific proposals regarding the number of its foreign employees.
However, his report showed that other important controls were carried out in a sample of five health authorities.
The chief financial controller examined staff recruited outside the European Economic Area, following the approach to the airport of Glasgow.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a land car was driven through the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transmission in October in the Old Bailey, and was charged in connection with the alleged bombing in Britain.
It is expected that the State Health Service shall carry out checks prior to the appointment of foreign staff to ensure that they possess the necessary qualifications, experience and authorisations to work in the United Kingdom.
Despite the use of Disclosure Scotland by the health authorities to verify pre-trial records, the Agency does not have to obtain these information on the competence of the Agency outside the UK.
The main examiner's report now contains other recommendations that the Board should draw up guidelines for the tax exemption, which would assist employers in checking in different countries.
"Although we have found some personal data on these checks, these have not been routinely carried out." The report said.
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their research guidelines in advance of the appointment, but added: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign health workers is available."
BMA Schottland president Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations would identify potential NHS employees who might be involved in future terrorist attacks.
"In the report it means that the NHS Scotland's current pre-election tests are well functioning and it is not clear which multiple values will be delivered to the recommendations," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, most of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was likely to be higher, even because of the problems facing them, to identify employees who have been allowed to stay on time.
The investigation further found that the control procedures established by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgov and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lotian were substantially maintained.
This includes passports, work permits, and qualification checks.
the Scottish Government is currently examining its policies and guidelines for monitoring the start of employment for foreign staff in the NHS.
The Secretary for Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "I had a case to carry out this work in view of the terrorist attack on Glasgow airport."
She added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines on control investigations in the event of the appointment of all staff members - including those from abroad - are planned for the next month.
Joy Division Dominant Film Price Award
Control, the film biography over the late Joy Division Singer Ian Curtis has hidden five prizes at the British Independent Film Festivals, including for the best film.
Prices were also paid to chief producer Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before he was cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbin, and neighboring producer Toby Kebell.
Dame Judi Dench was awarded as the best director for the Thriller Notes on a scandal.
And Bond Designer Daniel Craig won the Variety Prize for turning the British film into the world's public.
The prices were transferred to a ceremony in the London Roundhouse.

The Black Black Film - on its audiotrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Orders - was driven for only 3 million British pounds.
However, he has introduced the Dutch photographer Corbin, known to the first time for the cult cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, two prizes - as the best director and the best director.
Rockmusic was the middle of another award winner at the ceremony - as Julian Temple's film about the Clash singer Joe Strummer received the price for the best documentary film.
The price for the best performer went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a Russian Mafia boss in David Cronenbergs in London, playing Thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who is in charge of playing hard cores, has won Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films are Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Biest, is currently filming Indiana Jones Continue The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winston said he was proud to receive the price that camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney, who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He is my type of man, a great actor of his time, I am truly honored."
The independent film prices, known as Bifas, are selected by a group, which belongs to filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia has discovered yesterday that 208 million people have been arrested for their membership in cells that had planned an earlier attack on an oil plant, as well as on spiritual and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest exporter of oil said one of the cells had planned to bribe rockets.
Sympathetics from Al-Qaida have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been a United States liaison since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight million people, led by a foreign citizen, was planning an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the TV report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a strong fast-paced intervention force to protect Al Quaida's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an introductory statement, says that 18 of the arrested members belonged to a cell led by a "racet expert" who was illegally displaced in the country.
He reports that the militias had planned to launch eight projects into the Kingdom.
More than 22 of the detainees had to submit the report to provide spiritual and security forces.
The government has warned spiritually to stop Saudis who are seeking to join themselves with Al Qaida militias, who want to fight allyed combat forces and the US-supported Muslim government, which is considered by the Hardliners under the sun.
Al Qaida Milizen viewed many spiritual people in Saudi Arabia as cooperating with the authorities in supporting the policy of the royal family that governs the government.
The militia - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, Al Qaida Leader, born in Saudi Arabia - have looked at foreign housing, government buildings and energy sectors.
"This was a very great effort of the security forces over the last... five months," a speaker from the Ministry of Internal Affairs told the state television.
The arrests also involve a "mediazele" of 16 from Medina, which was intended to be used for the "Takfiri Thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims, which supports violence against Muslims, which is being burned as unbelievers and outcasts.
Among the arrested were 32 people who were charged with providing financial support to the militia.
The climate on Venus could give you an insight into the future of the earth
Perhaps Venus was once a pleasant place to live, said scientists yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft on a trans-shipment show that the planet is still more like a detached Earth's desire than it was previously known.
Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor of the earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planet roads, but the Venus of the sun is something closer.
Thousands of years ago, Venus had ruled conditions that were very similar to those on earth and could even have been inhabited, scientists believe today.
But because of the hottest carbon dioxide tribune effect, the erosion of the atmosphere through solar radiation and a slower rotational stimpo, Venus entered a completely different development course.
Today the planet is surrounded by water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is replaced by hurricane-strong winds and lightning towers.
The findings of the Venus Express Space Agency, which has examined the plants for a year, offer a satisfactory view of how the Earth could develop in view of the catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the leaders of Venus Express Mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from what the Earth is, while the planets are rather relatively similar."
"Our new data enables us to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago as the Earth, perhaps with a viable environment."
"Angericted Uran" by the police
A kilo radioactive material, reported to have been seized by the Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police speaker said three people were arrested and the material was tested.
He did not confirm whether it was a suitable uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (48,000).
Already open
In Rome he said that he did not consider it a presidential candidate to be asked by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the Presidency was finally ready to set up a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters would take questions on video and enter to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman, the Democrats asked about global warming in YouTube's debate by the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected exactly the state of the Republican party, which is going on in the elections next year.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers who supported the discussions with the selected YouTube Clips to show the candidates concerned.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, which was most devoted to a single topic, immigration was at the centre.
The subject is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of different voters to serve a choice when they heard what they had heard: The TV operator noted the tops of the consent as the candidates spoke strictly over the borders.
The toughest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national president, and Romney, who has moved forward in the decisive questions in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tried to break the call, he had been careful about illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He arrested Romney, in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts, of setting up illegal immigrants for work at his home.
In particular, the two asked each other whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (the illegals would provide a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Important candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Congressman, were able to examine this subject.
None of the two men have a serious chance of naming, but they both remain in race, perhaps because they have gone to immigration peace earlier and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates share the same views: harsh limits, intolerance against illegal migrants.
This theme, along with concerns about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps the Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly challenging as other topics.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drinking should be considered a folder.
One of the authors asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led to Giuliani’s accepting the position that although the Bible is his favorite book, he may not believe the history of Jonah and the wall in writing.
Another researcher asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now against all expectations at the first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty would be painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to know whether Jesus would punish them, he laughed at them and said Jesus was too intelligent to claim to a political office.
The race remains extremely open.
Hukkabee's rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Pauls' youngest contributors and his bids during the midweek debate.
These two were not raised because the two flights of the party had not yet been able to join one of the most famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party from the beginning and was convinced that it had a successful message about the size of America and a twinner to both flights of the party.
This time the party has been split and the result is far from clear.
The pain of the labor party
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole for the accident; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly easy.
Adel title does not appear to be sold, no policy-makers in Paris pay hotel bills, no special drawings have been paid.
But the discovery that a rich businessman spends more than 650,000 dollars (1.3 million dollars) for the British ruling Labour Party over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this is something that would have been good without the fighting Gordon Brown.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister withdrew the request for a choice, in a way that caused the intelligence of the British, claiming that questions had not affected this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, like Vince Cable, who, in an increasing degree, was the representative of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, developed the first-time Brown of Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The undisputed rescue of Northern Rock, a connected bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment powers under decision.
Badly planned proposals to amend the tax legislation have brought undertakings against the government.
The government's loss of personal data by 25 million people showed indisputable administrative swine fever.
A trio of generals in peace began a rebellion in the upper house from protest against cuts in military expenditure: to be a minister of combat forces, so they claimed to be part-time jobs.
There are now the numerous donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Secretary-General of Labour (and her former executive director) has already returned.
It doesn't mean Brown's unremitting direction of departure.
However, governments can achieve a turning point, after which they feel impossible to rule.
Nor do people like to trust politicians, but they usually keep their minds back when a new troops arrive at the office.
If once it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation, and he does not need to be in the process for a long time, this prospect is before: the public service begins to be forgotten; the cabinet ministers start to shout; the press are looking for bad news; and the government is going to be defensive and uncarried.
In one way, the position of Brown is particularly difficult because he cannot claim to be a new bee instead of other political leaders.
He'd like to lie to Tony Blair, he was his Lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax authorities, for example, relate to decisions that Brown took as director of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if he wasn't directly involved in Blair's missed message - as in the long "Gold for Adele title" investigation of political party funding - the voters may have concluded that it was.
Nevertheless, Brown's position is not as bad as it looks.
Conservatives are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one has died or has been completely accelerated.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Browns of course promised Stalinist tendencies: a reliable, solid and mild brutal government.
The new witness on political contributions is a good example.
The noble Abraham, who compares his donations with his common gifts, does not want to say public recognition for his favor.
This may be so, but the decision did not stop him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
What he said was aware of Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, will naturally have to ask a few questions; exactly like Jon Mendleson, the chief financial operator, who was told about the special expenses in October.
However, Brown is not involved so far: there is no indication that he was aware of these allegations, although the majority of the payments were made after his arrest in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has completed half the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the law by his party, but he corrected this decision by taking a known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - in order to complete the measure by a bishop in peace and a judge.
In this case, the "relative lessons" are not very complicated.
When the law was violated, it's a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairperson for the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been unemployed for six months, and making progress with a comprehensive reform of political party funding.
This would require the hardline of the lab to cooperate with the conservatives and, if possible, to establish the special financial relationship with the trade unions - more requests for a partner like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partial facts.
The conservatives now have a clear lead in the issues of opinion; he has two years to win the election; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through inapplicable legality and solid competence.
Cards
Does the credit crisis support the US credit card market?
If blood is in the water, it's only natural that reverse fluids are recuperating.
Now that America's real estate market is broken down, the raw animals have the country's credit card in the visitor.
Analysts of Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the risk of lending from sub-funded loans to other forms of consumer credit is increased.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases both in the savings and in the share of the loans that are not possible or beyond 30 days later.
HSBC has announced in the last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion tax increase from its US consumer funding, partly due to the lack of credit card holders.
It's too early to fall into panic.
Losses and damages are still low.
According to Moody's rating agency, the third quarter of the total population rate was 3.89%, almost a full percentage of the historical average.
The deterioration in the rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in US private insolvency law in 2005 led to an interruption of competition notifications that resulted in loss of credit for a large part of the credit card; the number of registrations (and therefore taxing the family) would increase whether or not the general conditions for creditors were lower.
The industry also reports on solid payment rates that show how much of its debt is paid to consumers every month
and the trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong despite the state of silence in other areas of structured funding.
Dennis Moroney from the TowerGroup, a research company, estimates that the expenditure for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
Direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market are certain: it is more likely that consumers will assume credit card debts, now that their own credit will disappear.
However, the card issuers look at the cash flow instead of the capital values, so when home prices do not necessarily result in a change in the creditworthiness of the creditor.
You can even benefit from the card display.
The incentive for consumers to continue to pay the mortgage rates is low if the real estates are less valuable than the value of the loan; as a result, card debts are more important under the return priorities.
Card manufacturers can also respond much faster and more flexible as a creditor to the tougher conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid reassessment of assets.
"We won't wake up one day and reassess the loans," says Gary Perlin, Capital Ones chief financial rapporteur.
Even if a sudden discovery crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable divergence are very real.
If lower home prices and a credit reduction in America are forced into the recession, the industry will no doubt face a worse future.
They continued to look at these hiafish flowers.
British banks are known guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers, who should be brought before the court for their role in the criminal system with the former chief financial officer of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their search in the middle of the week.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally spent seven cases of fraud using telecommunications means for alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial budget in 2000 to protect themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was applied on January.
But during a hearing before the U.S. District Court, Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone complained about a case of fraud using telecommunications means.
The three former management forces of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were known in Britain during the two years of delivery procedures.
In the United States, its case is the result of an investigation initiated after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The original charges against them in 2002 were noted by Fastow that he was the aim of an investigation by the Government in relation to the Enron Netherlands.
The charge against the banker - called the "NatWest Three" - claimed that they had come to Houston in the year 2000 to raise a scandalous plot with Fastow and his former top advisor Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of Enron's partnership controlled by Fastow, which was the architect of countless corrupt Enron companies that have contributed to attracting the company to the competition.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had valued its participation in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew that it was really valuable.
A company under Kopper's control acquired the bank's share of the subsidiary for $1 million.
Bankiers paid coupons $250,000 for the participation of this company.
According to the complaint, Fastow falsely argued against Enron that the energy company would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for its share in the subsidiary.
But actually, the 20 million dollars went to the British banks, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while hardwood, copper, and others dropped about $1.3 million, according to the complaint.
In January 2004, Fastow was found guilty of fraud in two charges for his role in the Enrons Pleite.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is a six-year prison sentence in Louisiana's federal prison.
Kopper sits a three-year sentence and a month in an institution in Tezarkana.
Each of the three men was on a free foot on the basis of a $1 million bail which required them to live in the United States in expectation of the trial.
Enron, first of the seven largest companies of the nation, broke up in the competition in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks, could no longer make billions of debts or make weak businesses appear profitable.
The collapse has destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market values and more than two billion dollars pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former president Jeffrey Skinling were sentenced last year to their roles in connection with the Enron merger.
Skilling is a punishment of more than 24 years.
Lays judgements for harassment, fraud and other complaints were not valid after his death in the last year because of heart disease.
Not all below in Moscow
The price of a car of the brand Golfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough wealth to fly from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But this is a small amount for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers room for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you asks for so many seats, because it's for a private family or company president."
Firer was at the Gulf Stream Station on the last Friday at the Millionaires exhibition, a four-day organ of the monitored consumption held in a spectacular exhibition center at the city center.
In addition to the Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury exhibits were built, hoping to attract new Russians to the money at all, from Mahoney-combed yachts to diamond-surfaced cars suitable for 50 cents.
Firer took careful care of a shining orange porsche at the next exhibition stage in the visitor.
"It's a beautiful car, but it's small in comparison to us," he said.
"According to the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
The Russian capital seems to be moved with as much money as Dallas's to his glasses.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s as some Americans came to giant wealth and went to Europe, where they were regarded as materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arab explorers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are the most liberal cash dealers in the world.
The exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share in gold.
In Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, was invited to exchange ideas on how to sell high-cost products on markets like Russia.
(The conference will be organized by The International Herald Tribune, which is part of the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, totalling 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, which are worth $670 billion together, according to a study on the development of private property in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert group here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8 percent of the Russians lived below the existing minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London Jewelier.
She had first visited the exhibition with the Russian trader of the brand, the Soho Jewerry Group.
"The women are all exemplary and the men are all worth a fortune."
As they take Sunday night clothing through the halls, two real estate makers, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients as millions.
"I've been protected by the cars and I've tried to decide between the Infinite, Mercedes and Porsche," said Mrs. Yumatova, who gave the designer clothes she wore, as a Roter-Tepich Veteran with Joan Rivers.
The exhibition appeared first to focus on the novels, the type of famous Russian buyers who would be willing to spend several hours in the apartment to visit a suitable warehouse, the tasteless Cadillac Escalades, bags of platinum, Mövenpick Eiskrem, balanced billiardtics, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddybaren.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, the patriotist at a exhibition of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before a walled imitation of a Rembrandt image made of handmade, blue mosaics.
"Of course Russians are more interested in Klimper-Klimper."
In fact, the traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years are old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the type of subsequent brands with limited numbers that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, thousands of people, whether millions, sent by millions of people or simply tourists, pressed every day through the halls.
And some of them bought it.
On the first night of the show on the last Thursday, Roman Ershov, general manager of King Koil Betten, said here, had sold two $70,000 matrate sets, made from silk, Kashmir and cotton, with fine gold feet.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company equipped high-end cars with high-end alarm systems that his company had sold the green orange porsche for 170.000 dollars to a Russian millionaire.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapted the luxury to customer needs, had sold three car coolers for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which was the same as related chain weapons, for each $55,000.
He showed a reporter an auto repair that was developed for a Russian casino owner, with stores that he had carried with colorful Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a wheelchair.
The cost: $22,000 for a quarter.
"The Russian millionaire, the street leader or a picture of his wife's face from a Cuban zirconium will not be allowed to ride on these wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He will keep it in his 30 or 40 car garage."
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr Carpetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not currently express much exclusiveity in view of the increase in this real estate price.
"If you bought a apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they may already be millionaires, at least on the paper if not already in Bargeld," he said.
"There are more than you believe."
Those who could not have done at least as if they were rich at a position held by Alliance Continental, a Russian resource management company.
The company had set up four red telephone cells according to the British model, which were completely stopped with mountains of false millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees had expressed 500,000 incorrect bank notes for the millionaires.
Passives stopped to pull back the wallets, mobile phones, while they went back in the middle of the replacement, let them cut off from friends, or simply hide a few million.
"See, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Embedded operation suspected at death in New Jersey
It was the day before the funeral as Ronald Livingston through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthy Restaurants here and watched as a hospital car stopped at the White Cape Cod two doors below the West Scott Avenue.
There was a police car right there.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the cashier's medical nurse's car," said Livingston, a restaurant supervisor on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone was dead."
The authorities found that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newarker Police Company.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether they died because of a procedure carried out by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon who did not identify the police and who worked in the house at West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet determined what has caused Mrs Arroyos' death, and it is hoped that toxicological investigations that could not have been available for weeks will help to clarify a mysterious death that has sent a grief through the leadership team of the Newark Police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director, Gary F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been widely known in the department.
"She was loyal, hard at work and hard at heart," said Mr. McCarthy about Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"It was my Pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newarker police officer working for the alcohol control committee and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a nurse.
Eileen Walsh, a speaker for the State Counsel of the Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's a ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they had arrived at the house about 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead.
More than a week has passed, and the authorities have reported a little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't mean to say if Mrs Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a modest rose stream stands in the close front of the garden and a Dalmatian called behind the house.
A blue face is described as "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanille in food and perfumes - in the parking area next to a door that led to an accident.
Two mountain bikes across the hall on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was priceless and helped him find a provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to watch this or that,' he said.
"She was always here when I came here and she was always here when I went.
It was painful."
Hopes that the central bank will reduce interest will lead to the increase in the world market
The shares spread on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, following market openings that the central bank will try to slow down the credit markets by further considerations, and encouraging comments from the vice-president of the US Central Bank.
The stock markets rise in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kahn, number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the central bank's president, said that the policy must respond "flexible and pragmaticly" to the persistent pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to slow down corrupt markets, in view of signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn, the youngest turbulence had "partly turned some of the improvement of market functions from late September and October".
If there were to be increased turbulence, they would increase the possibility of further deterioration of the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were received by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to step up and to stabilise the credit conditions in the US markets and possible other advantages.
The executions also helped slow down Wall Street, in view of further bad news from the US economy, now that the sales of US real estate reached a new record volume in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that they will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4% of their global workers, in a cost reduction measure, in order to offset severe losses from their lost assets in the US mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these jobs will be lost in London, where the bank employs 1,500 employees.
In New York the Dow Jones Industrial Index ran 331 points, or 2,55 percent, to close at 13.289.40, while the wider S&P 500 Index increased by 2.65 percent.
In London the FTSE 100 Index rose to 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to close at 6.306.2, which added more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany's Index Dax grew by 2.6 percent and France CAC40 by 2.3 percent.
In the past, the resale of credit pressure on the markets was reduced to 4.7 per cent, the highest rate since April 2001, following a strong demand for an auction of threemonats guarantee funds from the European Central Bank granted to the European Trade Bank.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow up and raise other capital resources into the money markets in London increased as credit tensions increased the three-month "Libor" rates to rent between UK banks with 6.59 percent higher since late September, following a continuous increase since 21 November.
England faces a decision on the statements by Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two Dilemmas, each of which is almost as difficult as the other.
Who's going to beat up as number 6 for England in Candy this week, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important, because David Graveney, the president of the election, at least under this special title, is here to help the chief coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan, and because the table of High Morries, the English-led director, is generally filled with applications for national electorates, if not even for any part of time.
Anyone who does not always get the sixth score will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is certainly.
It is never easy to determine exactly what enables a person to reach the tops of his profession, while no one else comes out of the lowest rank, sometimes because of lack of luck instead of ability.
It is not just in the circle where the selection is difficult, where judgments are needed, which are always subjective at the end.
Whether to raise the right time for Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same may also be asked in another area whether, for example, John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young driving forces with good conclusions that the business is well known.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player, whether it's given him the opportunity to swim or fall down.
Of course, numbers have a major impact on decisions, but these also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the right time if he can take a weekend and a sleigher must get regular opportunities on the agenda if he wants to make a daily cricket player impression.
The eyes of the selection are more complicated.
There were many who were better in the last season than, for example, James Anderson, who seemed to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison explained himself for health and how the wind blew into the net.
Anderson took 32 first-class bikes with every 33 runs to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hoped more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays in Asgiriya Stadium can be just a visual question.
The choice could determine the careers of both men, or it might make a little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and was successful in the first, with five Wickets and 40 useful runners, but it was Paul Collingwood, still struggling to establish himself, who created the break to a significant test-circuit player and who, though he had a double hundred points against Australia, may still be appreciated.
It is likely that after further discussion of the current web site at the Asgiriya Stadium, Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative instincts and feelings for Shah's greater experience with Boparas youth enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, he speaks of his working and valuable 88 test-debt in Bombay, 43 first-class hundred and only six of Bopara, who is 22 years younger, and an excellent balance against driven horses.
But Shah only made ten rounds in his two rounds in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his homeland as a player from Middlesex, and this, in addition to his immediate rejection of the voters as Vaughan, was healthy to take his position for the next game, seems to have taken the swing out of his shots, which was still public in Bombay.
In contrast, Essex has all the children who live with them.
He was impressed by nothing on a cricket spot and his attitude was taken away from the point when he had recently transferred a four-wheeled vehicle to an exhibition for English sponsor Volkswagen.
He experienced minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get out his vodafone (of course also posted) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had observed this from the distance, and to say with enthusiasm, "Have you seen this?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he competes with his medium time with some effect here on the playing field, which seems to fit him and hits him with confidence and message.
Choosing the right man is one thing to choose the right time to choose another.
Maybe this is the actual art of selection.
I'm going to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn't mean that Shah may not be doing well, but if, as the tissue suggests from Ceylon, he's the one who's playing here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived yesterday in Baghdad, with a stream of displaced persons whose funds have been spent or visas, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal.
Some even came back to fight the rebels who had driven them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government train by a dozen buses, the terminal was working with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad and how it would be safe now."
They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, regarding the military clergy's shields Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered the return of his forces to the present time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old skitish teacher from the dominant Sunni part of Amariah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian vision and because the regime of Iraq was not allowed to work.
His skiing neighbors in Amariah called him to tell him that a local militia, supported by the United States, helped him to expel Al-Qaida from their base in the west of the capital, and forced him back.
One of the new generations from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shichi tribes, who had been displaced from his home in Sleek in northern Baghdad by an attack with grenades after calling on his citizens to fight Al-Qaidas.
He was back to fight.
"Two days ago some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Al Qaida militia in Slekh and that they needed my support and my boys.
That's why I'm back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many reported that they had been captured by the increasing peace in the capital since the US-group increase and the growth of local "people affected" groups, who were armed and protected their territory in cooperation with the American military.
But more talk about being forced to go home by visa problems and financial resources in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion among the exileants that Nouri al-Maliki, the Swiss Prime Minister who had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled the country from the sectarian death squads.
"Uns went well to al-Maliki Syria and the government no longer forced the Iraqis to give a visa to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni Renter.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline of violence is that sunniites were dispersed from and around Shichitian residential areas, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have taken place.
There are fears that a sudden stream of refugees will be rescinded by sequential tensions and it will become a conflict.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest Germany is leading in vocational training and is even smoothing with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in a field of education, the islanders make the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I told a non-Calcian country last night that we are not French" - this slogan pictifies the smallest Germans themselves on his 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in Saarland's education system, which is in place in the educational monitor of the German Institute of Economy (IW).
The schools already cooperate closely with the neighbouring countries from tradition.
The University in Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can complete their study here with a double or even triple degree.
Similarly, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6 percent.
But also the landscapers bring Saarland in an average number of high schools - many of them without an end to Gymnasium.
"In Saarland, the vocational education system is used," says Axel Płnecke, educator at the IW.
More than five young people earn their education at a vocational school, so Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are similarly strong.
Compared to the population, the equipment with dual studies is the second largest in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates in the past years has decreased by one third.
As a result, the Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineers.
"After the first Pisa study, we have faced several reforms in the general education schools," says a speaker from the Ministry of Education.
So the government carried out a country-wide comparison test.
In order to teach children early, the last Chinese year is free of charge - a model that also copies among other German countries.
Whether the performance of the students improves continuously, future comparative studies will be shown.
In Pisa 2003, the proportion of risk students decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
In general, however, Saarland did not grow as strong as other Germans.
The Bayerns do better.
As far as the Saarland is concerned, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - there may be other points in this area.
For the language of the neighbours is a duty to Gymnasia - even if the overseas countries are not French.
Chávez sets the hours
In Venezuela, the clocks start to be different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December President Hugo Chávez will be allowed to return in the South American country in half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez is therefore a white figure.
As the official newspaper Venezuela reported, the clocks will be set at less than four and a half hours after a new law has been passed.
In this way, the South American state has a time zone that exists in no other country in the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez reasoned, inter alia, that the United States of the world would have set aside full hours in time.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (Ordertime) the breaking of relations with the neighboring Colombia because of a gesaliffer.
The left-nationalist said as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe President of Colombia remained, he would not be able to maintain relations with the Prime Minister or the Colombian Government.
"I can't do this alone because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is proposing a constitutional reform, about which the citizens of the Oulland must vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly increase his power in the country.
The solution to the dispute was the decision of Uribes to withdraw Chávez from the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, where it was about the release of hostages.
Uribe has been criticised by Venezuela with his decision to "betting her face," Chávez criticized on Sunday.
Also in Spain, Chávez is in all languages.
A new phone-klingelton provides in the country for Furore: "Por que no te callas" (Why don't you hold the mouth) the set that has already downloaded more than half a million people from the Internet.
Speaking to him was Spanish King Juan Carlos, who was famous for the ongoing interpolation of the left-wings and was threatened by the mouth.
German Drach 2007 Lohnminus
Despite the strong conjugation, German workers are expected to lose a real wage this year.
Experts called a whole set of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, the employees in 2007 could actually count less on the cash account than in the previous year.
"This is due to the significant wage development, the increased value of VAT and price increases in food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Conjunctive Research of the "Image" Foundation.
New pressures may also come in the employment insurance of workers.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrücker newspaper", the planned decline in unemployment insurance to 3.3 per cent per cent per year in the current situation is correct and reasonable.
However, the Federal Labour Agency may not be able to ask for credit or grants when it is required to ask it again, the SPD politician was invited.
On Tuesday it was announced that the price explosion in food and mineral oil products would increase the rate of inflation at the highest rate for 13 years.
The prices rise by 3.0 per cent in the year total.
Venus is the wooden twinling of the Earth
The Venus, despite its life-threatening atmosphere of the earth, is much the same as it has long been thought of: the European zone "Venus Express" has discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and windmills on Poland, as they occur on the earth in winter.
For almost three decades scientists have been convinced that it will be on Venus.
Now the European sin "Venus Express" has brought the evidence - she was inspired by electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The eyes on Venus shot at a height of about 56 kilometers from Wolke to Wolke, Christopher Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine " nature".
According to the famous "Usuppen theory", lightning has created life on earth: winters should have triggered reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the construction of life.
Not on Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in the very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today there must be hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times closer to the earth than it is to rule between temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus may be the Devil's willing of the earth, but it is a desire," said Russell.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the earth in size and size, has brought about such a completely different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The beginning of Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, since since since the beginning of the 1990s, no sin has been on its own to explore this planet.
The latest research results currently presented in several "natural" articles stress not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system but also the uniqueness of the solar system.
"They also show that the communities of our neighbouring planets with the earth are larger than they were first adopted," says the Esa.
In addition to the well-known wind at Nordpol, the researchers also found a cloudstorm on the south pole that is still much faster.
The phenomenon reminds of air currents on the Irish winter hemisphere, writes a research team about Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is nearly as large as a diameter of 12.100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as morning or evening stars, is about 225 days around the sun.
But he is much slower about himself: One Friday lasts 243 days.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar nearly reminds the earth, scientists note that both planets have been created under similar conditions.
On both sides, water was collected, which remained on the earth in oceans, but on Venus, it was lost in the world.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on the earth in carbon dioxide, it makes up most of the atmosphere on the Venus.
Kohler protects brands from encounters with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler wants a end of the party's fight for the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor.
Indirectly he criticized the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's view and has called for the great coalition to end the fight to receive the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present the outside world with this question to any united nation," Köhler told the trade sheet.
Kohler also signaled understanding of receiving the Dalai Lama by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knew that Germany had to be sensitive to foreign policy, said the Federal President, but he took Markel in front of the project, and they took a new Chinese policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not taken away from traditional Chinese policy.
It also knows China," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had been indirectly accused of receiving the Dalai Lama and therefore had been arrested from Union ranks.
Stonemeier had, among other things, condemned the Union's "Schauster policy" in foreign policy.
Following the receipt of the Dalai Lamas in the Chancellor there was too much irritation in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership has not only sent out the German Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to the information provided by the SPIEGEL, also rejected the so-called strategic dialogue of the Foreign Ministers.
Head of Government of China Wen Jiabao has now called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to accept the Dalai Lamas as a mistake.
China was pleased when European politicians officially received the religious leaders of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The words and words of the Dalai Lamas showed that he tried to disband Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other provinces today.
Scaubble warns against Krawalls like in France
Road strikes with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against Krawalls like in France.
It must be done in order to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from occurring in the street, the Federal Minister asked.
Barrikaden burned, Randalliers shot the police with scrotflints: After the heavy youth riots in France, Federal Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) in Germany fears a similar development.
"We need to make sure that we do not build up social explosives in our own hands and grow into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said the "New Press" appearing in Hanover.
Not every young person comes right with the rapid change of social reality.
Federation, countries and municipalities have already worked with the pressure to solve problems, said Schäubble.
This is not just the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, this is already the first success."
However, it would be too early for the alarm.
Schäuble also pointed out that in German cities there are no urban and sociological problems such as in France.
In the north front of Paris, young people had suffered serious road accidents with the police during the last few nights.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Toulouse.
More integration efforts by the Federal Government were requested by the President of the Turkish Community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the Krawalle in France, kolat warned against "neighbourishing effects".
However, the situation in Germany is not as fragile as in France.
However, there is a need for action.
Kolat points out that the unemployment rate in young people with a migration background is "over-averagely high" under 25 years.
In particular, more training should be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We must give the young people a perspective."
However, the President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany, more than in France, "a social control is taking place within the families".
Moreover, many young people with a migration background did not want to destroy what their parents have built up here.
Kolat said, "But we still have to be careful."
You must give young people the opportunity to participate in work and training as soon as possible.
Meanwhile, it remained very quiet at night in the Paris office of Williers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police officers were in use, a hacker overflighted the area with rails.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a number of burning millers and cars.
Since the morning, an offer of about 1000 security forces has been provided for peace.
The police will take as long as necessary, the Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced a visit to the city.
On Tuesday night, about 80 police officers were injured in Krawallen in Villayers-le-Bel.
In the following, the disturbances over toulouse.
The Krawalle were in a traffic accident when two young people came to life on Sunday.
The police are not responsible for the death of young people after first learning of state law.
In the reign of Angela Wolke
The fact-finding appearance of the Chancellor confirms that the coalition is in the end - and that there is nothing to be expected of itself.
In which country is this Federal Chancellor actually living?
After their incredible event in the general debate of the Federal Day, which was warm and contentless, one must say: not here - not in the country which you had to end up ruling.
The idea that she was too focused on foreign policy, Angela Merkel has referred back to a very serious sentence.
That was provincial, she said and showed that she didn't want to understand why the critics are going.
On the day of Bundesag, she has documented to all the people how much they have access to their work.
There was no concrete interest or even a feeling of concern about the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented himself: a retired politician who is running into foreign policy and who is still in danger.
For example, climate protection: In that case, it commends itself freely for the decisions of Heiligengendamm, but does not say how the climate targets are to be achieved in this country.
In general, the self-lob - so much uncertainty would have failed the CDU chief two years ago.
Now she's stuck to the bottle that the awakening comes to people.
So she damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems instead of beautifuling the world.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke, internal political problems are a barrier.
Children's Armor and the concerns of the underprivileged server?
She's got a few extras for that.
It is marked by how often she promises when it comes to the adoption of the child.
Three steps need Merkel there to bring out a half-pound set.
She's proud like a foreign land when it's concrete.
Division attack
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, are delivering a hard exchange of slogans - and now they have to fear an external candidate.
The emphasis on candidates is already on the first theme.
He has made New York a "influenza place for illegal immigrants", and he introduces his rival, Rudy Giuliani, in the middle of Romney.
This quota, on the other hand, with serious prejudices: "I would say, his own house was an illegal port," rejected Giuliani and asked the former governor of Massachusetts to have private immigrants without papers.
The candidates are launching an attack: because the Republican base still has no clear preferences, the eight presidential advisers use the debate on CNN in particular to discredit their opponents.
The self-run 30-second videos that Internet users have posted via YouTube are almost more than a touchstone.
"With this sort of isolationism we have given Hitler power," says John McCain to his rival Ron Paul, who asks for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq as the only one in the round.
Romany is also able to read the Levites from the Vietnam Veterans when he refuses to use the so-called "waterboarding" as a means of symphony to be simulated in drinking as a folder.
That the main issues of the campaign, however, are apart from Iraq's war and global debate, shows the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg in Florida.
When conservative values are always prized and future tax increases are paid, the Auditorium Beifall fires.
Once again, it shows where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was shocked at that time," says Romney Cerknerscht, and tells the base and television audience that he was still a member of the company's sponsors in 1994.
On the contrary, Giuliani comes to the Schlinger when he is asked to explain the Bible in his opinion.
Musharraf first reigns in Civil
One day after his return as army chief, the Pakistani army chief Musharraf was declared president.
To end eight years of military leadership in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was arrested on Thursday for another five-year term of office.
The Pakistani TV broadcasts the ceremony at the Presidential Palace of the capital of Islamabad live.
Musharraf must pay attention to the Constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
In the middle of the week, he had transferred his office as army chief to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani and, in particular, had suffered international pressure from the United States.
Eight years after his death in a bloodless military coup, the former General now reigns for the first time as the civil head.
With his return as chief commander of the fighting forces, Musharraf had met a core requirement of opposition and of the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the exceptional condition which the musharf had attached on 3 November.
Soon after his declaration, Musharraf, according to General Public Prosecutor Malik Muhammad Qayum, will raise the exceptional situation and thereby meet another demand of the West.
In the past week, the Supreme Court of the State, who had appointed the musharf after the closure of the state of emergency in early November with him, had pronounced all charges against the contested re-election of the Head of State on 6 October.
In addition, five soldiers were killed and four more were killed in the northern tribal region of north-Weziristan in an attack on a military convoy.
According to an army speaker, the bomb exploded on a road near the border of Afghanistan.
The fathers of the Krauttrick return
Germany's Supergroup of Sevenziger again musics: The three members of Harmonia re-entered their consoles at a concert in Berlin.
For Revival, a medium appears from its great time "Live 1974".
At that time, they were much more famous in the country.
The above-mentioned feeling then occurs in the form of three seats at the table of evenings.
Everyone has his pants in front of himself, his cable and, above all, his buttons.
Dieter Moebius spins in the white hemd with 63 years in the middle.
Left-franched by Michael Rother, 57 years old and owned by Laptop and Guitar.
Right from the audience, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, concentrates on the console.
Everyone's singing, but even a beat.
And sometimes it adds to a regular piece of music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
The band harmonia resuscitated under Krautrock lovers for some excitement.
Where you can fill in here: Targeted questions found that the name was difficult through collective pop memory, but no paths are so sustainable that this band has been painfully lost for 32 years.
But why should the Germans not celebrate their living legends from the seventh years?
As long as what is called undirected Krauttrick, in England and America, there is more to it than in its own country.
When the music industry lost the surviving Kölner Group Can 2003 the echo-price for the work of life, it saw in the hall asking German pop viewers.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked themselves in the La Düsseldorf and New Bands in Laudatio, the surprise was not limited.
At the concerts, Michael Rother later stared at the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the stage as an old team.
The problem of ignorance here and the declaration in the country is one.
That is why the memory has already been charged with harmonia because the trio has only existed for two years and at this time also has a much lower effect than has been assigned to them overnight by others.
Moebius and Ruedelius had already performed with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the many promising names cluster.
First, you played in the basement under the Berlin Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a plate label held by the church.
Rother had recently assisted in powerwork and then as a guitarist at New!, who at the time might be the most radical German group, played a call.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians in Exil to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the old Weserhof, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as urban Communists.
Less ideologically than in the municipality I, where Roedelius was still suffering as a child.
It's a great art show.
It appears that in the spring, there was also a spring of the Song of Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for the art.
Some of them kept Harmonia's party.
The first album was "Music of Harmonia" and the next "De Luxe".
Because it's so easy to let the music sound too, the band has a material need.
The travel collection was not the only thing to do.
The CD "Live 1974" now appeared was interrupted at a concert in Greece, before a nearly 50-headed record-clusters, as someone thinks to mind.
That was when Rother came to force the harmony and to practice.
For Ruedelius and Moebius an unstinting demand.
The band explained their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the Esoteric Spherical and ensured his existence with albums as "flamming hearts".
Cluster was re-lived in the eights and is either more successful than it was Harmonia.
The Grisser Live album is Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its platform company Greenland has set its goal of providing the Krautrock as a clean German contribution to live music.
New! It was already excavated like Ruedelius Solowerk.
The physical reconstruction of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of Cultures of the World.
Publicly subsidised, in the framework of the festival of Woldronics.
Julian Cope is there, the British, Altpunk and author of the "Krautrick Sampler" manual.
There is also the Loveparade Erfinder Dr. Motte.
With which the entire band width of the impact of the Krauttrick on the next pop music would be affected.
Harmonia is filled with the learning of the supergroup.
Brian Eno's sentence shifts with the most outstanding sound in the hall: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are pictures showing the producers with harmonia in the farm.
The layout serves projections of other black and white photos of devices that are wired.
The three vets are once again included with improvisation.
Not anymore, by putting microphones on the organ and vessel to unlock the instruments over self-contained powered tones.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three into a technical detonator.
Nor does the chor of the house change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Mornings, the sound waves are heated and washed and sing at a beautiful place with the emphasis "Aaaaaaah!".
Krauttrick was always a very English term.
It was never about Rock.
The roots were smaller in the blue than in music schools (Can), technologies (power plants) or on the flight to artistic and social conventions (clutters).
Whoever calls here "'68!" doesn't have quite wrong, and Harmonia can't get out of it right now.
Even the most understandable is fundamentally overemphasized at the stage.
Where does music begin and when does it end?
This can rob one of the nerves or protect flying moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Meditary Peace", two films are again dealing with the Balkan war.
But they both don't believe it.
Either the concepts are too much on action and gambling or they are too ridiculous.
There, too, Richard Gere can't help in "The Hunting Party."
The good news is first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, it is calculated there, in the dark backland of the Bosnian War, that player Richard Gere has now been re-found.
We had lost the most beautiful man of the eight-year-olds, since too many net-interested roles in women's welfare films and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism were the fun of being seen.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument, "The Hunting Party - If the Jägers are going to win" (Why should film title today always be as long and we should be like Lokführer's tariff contracts?) perhaps.
He gives a wonderful picture: On the basis of his war reporter Simon Hunt, what could have been made of gas, if the Schicksal and the Filmbranch weren't so good: a man who has been his best time behind himself for a long time, but who has even kept himself as a terrible memory of his fall still a considerable remnant of the only charm.
But despite this storm, "The Hunting Party" together with the German production "Meditary Peace", which also begins this week, only the final series of disintegrated Balkan war films continues.
With "meditative peace" you can make a short process: the film is made by two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from cosopharyngal shield, where he still loves a prompt.
Although it is commendable that even here the Serbs are not represented as the only root of all waves, the TV film loses itself very quickly in gambling and action.
There remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a car but for this war.
On the contrary, the "The Hunting Party" can just look at the example of why it has not yet given a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who are trying to convince Serbian war criminals "the Fuchs" would have become a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and another driver (both in Personal Union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories seem to be fascinating: Both models go small teams into the forest to accomplish something the soldiers can't and both ways it will be a trip in the wagon.
One of the reasons for the scandal of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is not simply allowed to be the artist who comes down with his heart when he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script has to discover him above all another romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the back when the reporters in the last five minutes of the timer procedure have achieved what Nato, CIA and all the world's war criminals have not achieved in five years: the war criminals are caught and the Muslim Bosnians are left on the right track.
This is so bad that you want to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against kinology.
The film has a lot of human affairs.
He wants to start that Karadzic and Mladic are still free to run, and he suspects the Americans and the French (there should be only a few times) of persecution because of secret political talks.
But the good community and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous brecht comes to mind.
It says about the wood mask of an Asian demon at the labor table of the poet: "I feel sorry for the educated foreigners: as hard as it is to be."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly the same kind of shwellheads, but they're not what it's trying to be.
The problem is not limited to the generation of the Balkan war film.
It has recently been reported in this newspaper that all Iraqi films Hollywood were large flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa film.
It's almost always true: If a star runs out on the world's crisis gardens or mining fields, then something comes out like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "unless of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are too close at this time.
It had to be gone for decades before Hollywood was able to film a good movie about the Holocaust with "Schindlers List".
Some films are still being filmed - which are now used as classic Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have not been celebrated in any way as masterpieces.
But maybe today we know where each mass murder actually comes to home at the same two screens, too simply too much about the world's conflicts.
And that brings to the writers the carelessness that it takes to tell good stories.
"His or not" or "the great dictator" have also become so good, because Lubish and Chaplin have not yet known how badly the Nazi regime was ruling.
Maybe you don't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you need to have the far-reaching artist view of Romance Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was asked to parallel between his historical novel "Lemprières Wordbook" and the Balkan war, he answered: "It is only because some things never change.
Great cities will always be extremely dangerous, people will always be brutally murdered and war will always rule in Yugoslavia."
From Beust wet criticism for Olympic Absage
The abolition of the mayor from Hamburg's application for Olympic Summer Games has resulted in severe criticism of politics and economy.
Many still want to fight for the games on the water.
However, realism is based on appreciation of the opportunities.
The main business leader of the Chamber of Commerce Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, called a list on Wednesday as "not good for the place of business".
No other project has in recent times produced as much motivational forces in the city as the Olympics.
"Without this objective, the sport political movement would not be able to be maintained in the same way."
Schmidt-Trenz asked the Senate not to finish the project, but to find a new long-term approach to it, "it goes from a modified timeline".
Mayor Ole of Beaust remained on Wednesday at previous statements, where the Olympics of Hamburg were unrealistic until the year 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic bid, but on the German Olympic Sports Bond," said Beust WELT Online.
It refers to the decision of the Sports Federation expected for the beginning of December on an application for Munich for Winter Games 2018.
"This preference means for us that we will have no realistic chances in the period from which we were expected to be until 2028."
However, the dream was not always exhilarated, said Beust.
The Hamburg Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This will make the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to compete for Olympic games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to create a chance by completing the plans at this time," HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
In addition, a reservation to the application is in opposition to the statement made by the Head of State of the Senate on the basis of an acceptance of the General German Association of Higher Education.
There, Beust named the application Hamburg for the University 2015 "not as a substitute" for Olympic games in Hamburg.
In the past week, the High School Sports Association has been nominated as Bewerberg City.
The SPD bourgeois group suggested that the Senate should not have spent valuable time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Small Grasbrooks has been delayed for years by the Senate because it has placed on the map of Olympics and cleared the apartment building," said SPD coordinators Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Small Grasbrook has always required an integrated planning for Olympics and a later use of housing, the CDU has put on the "Event factor" one side.
The 2012 Olympic Summer Games application was a great surprise in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg was split into Leipzig.
That's not Warhol's kitten.
Whoever connects the terms of Sweden and woodkits, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, in Sweden, made wooden kists made dark shadows on Warhols' workshop.
Most of the Brillo boxes listed there from the "Type Stockholm" are fakes.
Following the Swedish newspaper "Express" a few months ago, doubts about the reality of Andy Warhols Brillo Boxes of the year 1968, internal research in Moderna Museum in Stockholm now comes to a satisfactory result: The six Brillo Boxes, which the former museum director Pontis Hultén of the Moderna Museum 1995 has made as a reflection, are copies - and probably also the majority of the other Brillo Boxes from the "Type Stockholm" on the international art market.
The history is obvious, a confusing generation of artistic and curative productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo Boxes" in New York, which were made of wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the boardboard of the sea pulver "Brillo".
A exhibition of his works at the Modern Museum in 1968 was presented - with Warhols Agreement - hundreds of Brillo-Kisten from papal: These were not from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo-Carthonagen factory.
It was not about works of art, but about their examples, just about exhibitions.
At the same time, Warhol 1968 may have granted permission to produce a few Brillo wood kits in Sweden, which were not issued in the Moderna Museum.
Newspapers now speak of about fifteen boxes, which were then registered as the original Andy Warhol Brillo boxes with the title "Type Stockholm" right into the art and auction history.
Some of them have earned over $100,000 on auctions.
The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontis Hultén later claimed that about a hundred wooden kits were produced and exposed in Sweden, which Warhol then left him.
In fact, Hulténs 105 kittens were produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
Warhol has been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Moderna Museum, has also examined three of the six museum's Brillo-boxes from Swedish private property, two of which were manufactured in Stockholm in 1968: their presspantas were first grounded and dried, then white oil was added with a pen.
In contrast, the structure of the copies from 1990 shows that the colour with a painting roll was placed directly on the presspant disc - it is also not about oil but about acrylic colour.
"These boxes were not authorised by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo Boxes," said the Director of the Moderna Museum, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to another conclusion, the Moderna Museum will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibiting material."
Already in July, the authentication board has announced to follow the "hard charges" that will be raised in the case of sea pulver kits.
But sooner or later, you're lying there in an inexhaustible cage.
Rebellious Soldiers in Manila
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers, who appeared in a hotel in Manila, had asked for the direction of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He couldn't answer blood transfusions, said Director Antonio Trillanes, who is responsible for corruption and elections, reporters at the hotel.
The hotel had previously been driven by government troops.
About two thousand soldiers had been scattered in the building for hours.
About half of them stood on Thursday because of a failed trial in 2003 before the Court - under the Trillanes.
He used the deal to suddenly end up with about 30 sympathians.
The military police who should actually keep watch on him were apparently passing over to him and closing his office.
They entered the Penisula Hotel and requested the direction of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops stopped the area around the hotel.
The President introduced a pressing meeting of the Security Agency.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the conduct of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who previously authorized the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said other military units wanted to join the march in a short time.
Government critics had called for great demonstrations against the President for Friday.
Your government has been overspending for months on corruption.
Manila Finance District has already been the main site of the attempted metere of about 200 military personnel against Arroyo.
After almost 24 hours of refusing to join the army, the opposition broke out.
Since 1986 there have already been at least seven tests against democratically elected governments on the Philippines.
United Internet is a major asset in transfer
United Internet has ensured a proportion of more than 20 per cent of the telecommunications company's sales.
The average price per share is 14,46 euros, as reported by the company on average.
We now have 20.05 percent of the capital.
An overtake was previously speculationd.
You kept the option open to increase the proportion of sales.
With this step, you want to promote the consolidation of the German DSL market, shared the United Internet with you.
In the middle of the week, the Berenberg Bank has already had an increase in its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator by another 5 per cent to 15.1 per cent.
The cash house held the shares only for a third party, it was on the financial market.
On Monday, the United Internet had already participated with almost 10 percent of the mobile company Drillish.
As part of a capital increase, Drillsch has placed 17.4 million new shares in the value of EUR 106.4 million.
5.15 million shares from it have purchased United Internet for EUR 31.4 million.
In addition, the companies have included discussions on marketing cooperation for DSL and mobile phone products.
"We strengthen our partnership," explained a United-Internet speaker.
The two companies established the Community company MSP to take over the competitor's freenet.
First, the two companies want to satisfy themselves with a share of good ten per cent on freenet and do not use their right to take more 18,49 per cent on freenet, shared the United Internet on Thursday.
However, the two companies continued to open up all options, in particular the increased involvement of the Freenet AG.
Discussions between the United Internet and Freenet about a strategic partnership were completed in mid-November.
The ongoing and only hard-to-see poker for Freenet has been part of the consolidation of the German Telekom market for months.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile phone customers at the end of the third quarter and 1.27 million DSL and complete connectors.
The maintenance of United Internet and Drillish has so far maintained 6,01 percent of freenet shares.
Now it was agreed that Drillish would bring about four percent more.
The right to buy 18,49 per cent of Vata's investment company was already agreed in August.
