No novelty for Tymoshenko by Parliament
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament refused to withdraw the application under a new chapter of the Criminal Code, on which basis the opposition leader, Julia Timoshenko, had been sentenced.
The new arrangement which could have opened up the way for the Minister of Foreign Affairs to be set free allowed the members of the Chamber, on the second reading of the application for a remedy for the punishment for economic deliberation.
Timoshenko was sentenced in October to seven years' imprisonment for allegedly late contract with Russia on the purchase of land gas.
The judgment is not yet legally valid, in December the appeal of the Judges is to be brought before the Court.
Timoshenko himself called the judgment as the political root of the regime, and also in the West, the process raised the question of the pre-triality of the Court.
The request, paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was sentenced to withdraw from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 members.
226 votes in favour would have been necessary.
Libbyscher victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or the Libyan rebellion already knows its loser.
Muammar al-Gadafi is located in an unknown place in the desert and without it the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As is common in this region, in the election of Islamists, the question is only what - the balanced or radical.
The National Transitional Council was famous for the customary law of the Scharí Ža, from which one has a certain idea before God.
Libya would go to the country without criminality, because for the fatty steel, you'll cut your hand short.
Women should also forget the thought of emancipation as soon as possible, any beliefs may be corrected, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the society will be united in the future by the Koran from opposing tribes.
In the short term, in Libya, there will be an order which will hardly be proposed and, above all, will not be desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is now not the only and objective view, although it is not the best and the difference would hardly fit the above-mentioned Liberians.
It is even more exciting to see the Muslim fighter being helped by the faithless dog.
To their apology, the fact may only serve the fact that NATO’s air strikes were not guided by any general of America, but by God himself, whose power was granted after any successful encounter.
The winner in Libya?
We only took part in a change in the committee, served the interests of Islam and our politicians in the person of the dictator of a political union without having had any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we saw more than a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the Hissians are a cause of concern - namely the surrender of the cruisers.
But the mining companies also get the black gold at the spot price without occupation?
Of course, the West can finally rest with the right of its independence in matters of the protection of human rights.
If this is not the case, they will not be affected by the Shari-Qa'a.
Start a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of the investors.
On Tuesday a statistical storm was needed through Europe.
The Member States will publish their data on their BIP for the 3rd quarter.
In comparison with the previous quarter, Germany and France, the Czech economy continued to lie.
But today the bond market needs all records.
The investors not only maintain Greece, but also between Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical agents of the European zone, Germany, Czech Republic and some other European countries published their provisional forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
The GDP in Germany is expected to grow by 0.5%, which in France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries adjusted their data for the second quarter, in which Germany listed higher growth than was originally expected (increased by 0.3% instead of 0.1%), while France experienced a slight decline of 0.1% (original data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent this year in the third quarter compared to the previous year.
However, compared to the previous quarter, the gross domestic product increased, according to Tsch. Statistical Office, thus confirmed the trend in growth growth in economic performance.
So the results are worse than the forecasts of analysts.
The most important events:
In this year's third quarter, the Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter, however.
The German economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
Between July and September, the economy in the euro area and the EU as a whole marked an increase of 0.2% compared with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy dropped by 5.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
The income from their 10-year state loans decreased by 28.45%.
The income of the Italian and Spanish State loans rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries also start to suffer problems...
The interest in Czech State loans remains below 4%, even if the situation in the region deteriorates.
In Germany, votes are to be taken by the ECB in favour of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football election has mastered the most difficult task of the entire season!
Thanks to a well-established tower Czech and a wonderful tower by Petr Jiráček, they won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a large portion of luck, the Czech football was thus able to protect its luxurious origin from the game and will never be lost in the European Union again.
IHNED.cz followed up in a detailed report.
Less excitement in the first half and a rice proportion luck in the second half.
The Czech election also won thanks to the final weakness of the household, a brilliant Czech and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro, exactly 1:0 and thus opened her ticket for the football team.
Also because of the precise defense game of the Czech men, they put the Montenegrins under more pressure in the second half of the year.
The bird birds of the party were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who had two chances of shooting.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech election will be joined by the European Championships next year, and it is also happy that the domestic football will cover a premium of about 200 million.
From the first few minutes on, the game was played directly by the fighter football.
Both men were long combined, and so was especially played around the middle line.
In the second half of the year, the pressure of the household remained high, and the long delays before the trial were successful because of the Czech revolution.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's core program.
They formed a living painting.
A few hundred high school students formed a living wall around it around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for the country's country's core programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed on Tuesday before the object and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students of the University of Iran in Isfahan formed a living hole around the core technology centre in Isfahan, in the Uran.
So they wanted to make sure they were ready to protect their country's country's core program, even if it was necessary to protect their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has recently stated in its report that Iran has not given up all its efforts to nuclear weapons for a long time.
In Israel, too, there is a possible attack on Iranian nuclear power plants.
On the afternoon before entering the complex, the students had prayed and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
In the case of an attack carried out by the intention to place the Iranian nuclear programme extensively, the Israeli press from the centre in Isfahan would also be the nuclear-reduction facility in Nathan's attack target.
The food card of a pregnant child: It doesn't breakfast and eat at nightbreak Wurst
More than a third of the children from 9 to 13 have problems with weight, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Show current surveys - adipous children are mostly from families with poor lifestyle.
This again shows how important for the healthy development of a person is the million in which he grows and the examples that surround him.
On the tables of adipulative children, wetware is up to half the time on the table than in families in which normal weighted children live.
More than 19 per cent of the overweight children had an event under the motto "Adipositas is not an accident" Pommes for the nightbreak.
In families with Dickerchen, sports is not just about love jobs, but it is also about the majority of today's students - only 15 percent responded that their parents found themselves at least once a week for active movements.
Question of 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, where nearly 900 children from primary schools were asked throughout the Czech Republic.
This was already the second anniversary of the action "Adipositas is not an accident", supported by the General Hospital and Unilever Society.
To date, more than 12 thousand students from 4 and 8 classes participated in the project.
Unhealthy diets and lack of movement in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the alarming increase in the number of children with obesity or even obesity.
"Only half of the children asked, for example, five times a day, in the morning-second morning lunch-vesper meal, one of the main conditions for healthy food," says one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and breakfast for breakfast
Experts point out that also relatively minorities, such as regular family breakfasts, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In Czech mornings, however, only 23 percent of the students' families.
And in most families, everyone spends time alone.
The worst was the finding, which is not even breakfasted in every 10 families.
The breakfast applies to this as the basis for healthy daily food.
The survey led, inter alia, to the day in which overweight children were consumed much more often than unhealthful pommes.
And almost everyone - without looking at weight - drink sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children in question compete in sports, only less than half of their parents do so - that is only 15 percent.
Merge your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to combine their own diet with the possibilities offered by Appetit and their opinion.
"What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 in puncto food is far from the ideal of healthy food.
Among its favorite dishes are many meals, meat dishes and, of course, sweet dishes.
"Alarming is particularly the great popularity of sweet lemonades", the final report highlights this question.
In the afternoons, the main court ruled, ten-year-olds won almost every flight.
The children were almost not able to even eat the fruit and the popularity of fish and vegetables was very small as lunches.
Health Care
At the same time, the survey also showed that children are too willing to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
"In many cases, the control group of the respondents who completed the questionnaires following the conclusion of the statement "Adipositas is not an accident", a significant shift of preferences to the principles of healthy food was noted in the results of the project.
At the same time, for example, in the sweet Limos, where many children began to give priority to regular water.
In the questionnaire, the children also crossed many other flights or fish as the main court of the day and were ready to eat less beef or sweet foods.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the opening article on how to learn about stylists, I had a little mixed up that it was a little too much for the beginning.
I didn't know what else was coming.
Presentations by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problem figures and a seminar on how to run "on the spot".
It's gonna be even worse.
The closer we get to the test, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every day and every Sunday, it is still full.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (at the course no single man participates) how to treat a woman who has no ideally proportional figure.
And that's still most of us.
The one has a very short neck, the other one is too young without proper curves and others are soft.
It's the thing of the stylist to swivel wide shoulders optically, extend the neck or reproducing the necessary curves.
We also get tips how a woman type like Jennifer Lopez - so with big buses, wide hips and small waists - is attractive and figure tone, without it being too provocative.
If, for example, the difference between size and height is so large that the rock or wood really does not fit, at least one piece should be cut to a scale.
This is certainly not easy, because good seating clothing is easy to pay.
In such a moderate rock, one feels much better than in one of the pillars, which is always raised and adorned, in the waist, etc.
Young figures can also be allowed to wear clothes with flakes, bauze, applications, stickers or scraping.
With this amount of information and figures, I am happy that I have a whole week of time to let everything go thoroughly through my head.
Nevertheless, I am afraid that in view of the proposed homework, it is almost impossible to create.
Each of the participants received a promi, which was intended to reflect their suitable expenses - day clothing and adrobe.
In this regard, we should take into account the current appearance, fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm going to "take Miranda" times, which you may know from Victoria's campaign secret.
In the inside I jubilant, because this is much better for me personally than to attract, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably taken hundreds of kilos (well, that's a little overdue), or the young Selena Gomez.
The clothing items should be cut off from journals or searched, printed and then processed graphically on the Internet.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, then our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design should be expressed.
It is very important to think about the graphic page of the styling.
The stylelist draws the models not only purely physically but also designed the so-called product page in the journals (by concrete practice, for example trend handbags, coins, etc.).
This is what the stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us.
But it's only Sunday.
That means a stylist must have a good overall view.
The Saturday contract, which was filled with information on figures, was the same as three visitors from the industry:
by Stylist Jan Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylelist should be able to use it.
And a skilled stylist is able to work with a single piece of clothing in all different ways.
The word magic is variable.
For example, you can wear a break coat as usual over the Jeans, as well as a T-shirt or mantel, but you can also wear it on the naked body, take a pair of shoes and wear it as clothing.
It's enough to raise the nerves or the forces and the whole look looks quite different.
"Play the lady," he insisted.
But most of the time, the Council said, "First, you have to know the rules perfectly."
"First you have to hurt her," said Jacob.
Finally, I can explain why we need to paste all these teachings, what you can combine with, and why, even if you often see anything else in fashion journals.
Get out of fashion shoes.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylelist must have prepared a lot more clothing options than he finally photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (about ten outfits) to wear at least fifteen styles.
And also that wearing on the photo in combination with other accessories looks quite different from actually.
All of this has to be done in the design of the outfit.
The image and style of success in half of the success, which confirmed us, too, Jan Pokorný.
It is only once that Madonna needs to look at a non-lighting singer who has made a world star from the image and marketing.
In Chechnya, the services of a stylist are more reserved against them.
Also known personalities often hold this for outstanding money (the main thing is that I bring something, as I look like it is twice the size).
And if any one of us is already styled, then we should think that he or she will force us to a completely different (smaller) size if he or she really needs it.
Then you just need to go on to make sure that the Boulevard press writes that the relevant promi has to or took away, etc.
Jan and Mario put us in the heart on Sunday, not to believe that a stylist should focus only on the fashion and then "construct" the outfit.
In his work, he has to communicate primarily with the people he is silenced and he has to be a strict psychologist.
People appreciate it without offering themselves or thinking about it.
"If we are ordered by any manager to look at her garment bottle and to finish beautiful pieces, then we can't remove her whole piece and say - my God, that's terrible."
"I have to find at least a few praiseworthy things to recommend what you can do," says Mario.
He also showed us exactly what such a so-called "platz bag" must contain.
So this is a bag that you connect to the toilet and you put all the necessary properties in it.
In addition to such clear things as shoes, hairdryers, hairdryers or safety belts, they also contain tools such as a nylon thread (by helping the stylist to photograph products such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the outer garment is affected if it is too large (skin or other clothing are forbidden so that the substance is not cut) and of course close.
But in order not only to listen but also to try something practical, we learned how to properly bend the shoulder.
Even when photographing in the theater, where the floor is on top of the floor, you can damage the shoes, wash the outside.
We're dressed and we're dressed...
You can't even touch the shoes with the sword so you can't hurt them.
So you really have to go ahead.
Mario delighted me by praising my "Creation" without restrictions.
That is not just my strength.
All of this was only part of what we heard at the second week's postgraduate course.
One thing has become clear to me - to turn the style into a professional level is not a child game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The original careless drive becomes completely avoidable, dilettantic error for routine driving for breakfast.
Although it was possible to meet the ambitions for a large part, what would have been useful if no one obviously had a desire to do a little more.
Just before he came to the Ladentic, the new part with the title "The Run" grew high expectations.
However, he promised that the already-enhanned "need for Speed" game series would move a piece again into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples, he did not actually appear to be just one of many action games.
We were also curious how the adjusted passports appeared, in which the main protagonist stands out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you're already used to it in NFS, there's a lot different in the end effect than you've expected.
Sure - there's a potential right-hand arcade race, but overall the game of some overflight errors that have been present in this series for a few years or less.
So it's not really a mistake anymore, but rather a sign of an inconsistencies of the players in principle.
The adventure begins very well.
For the first time in history, its main figure of Jack has certain problems of personal character; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal competition by America.
In San Francisco, then on the west coast, one is on the left - with the task of being first in New York.
The foundationide contains a whole series of interesting elements.
The whole route is divided into ten steps and more than fifty individual rows.
This means that each race will be assigned to another route and that the individual steps will take place in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
You don't have a moment to feel that game would always offer the same thing again.
Some of the environments are still quite good to look at, although the technical level of the graph does not extend beyond that of the previous parts of the series.
So there's nothing going on in the world.
But the ride through the deserts, through fertile land or high up through deep-sea landscape is very pleasant in sight.
Here and again, unusual elements bring a little variation in the individual race.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts the view.
In the mountains again, you have to make sure you don't get caught by a lion.
In addition, the individual rows are properly built together.
It's only a few, but it's enough.
For a long time, you try to keep the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have to stop time (classic race against the stoptrack), then you expect another personal dilemma with a single rival.
And that's what the police are trying to do with the whole thing.
A novelty is passports in which Jack leaves the car.
This involves some interactive animations in which Jack runs before someone and where the player needs to help him by pressing the right button at the right time.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are much less such passports in the game than you would expect (most certainly only three).
Finally, this is the case for the benefit, because at least this element has no chance to become long - it is part of the context of the elements that make the game more varied.
The model of the vehicle is drawn in the footsteps of the previous parts.
This means, from today's point of view, there are no trees out there, on the other hand, you could not claim it would be bad.
Anyone looking for realistic simulations must look different.
But an action-charged racer will continue to be well justified despite the fact that it could be found better in competition.
Until then, everything is in the best order.
Real problems will arise only after a certain time.
In contrast to the vehicle model, the collition model is not entirely O.K.
From a game of this kind it is hardly expected that complicated deformations and collisions are calculated, but if you actually don't have an object on any of them, how the car behaves, it's obviously not everything in order.
Typical example: In some places you "drive" the other cars just easily, in others, almost identical situations, but you get into the stairs and turn wild pirates.
Or the cart goes to the same end.
Thanks to the restart system, however, it doesn't make any more, it's embarrassing.
The reboots are so solved: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, then you start a game back to the last start point of the track.
Only - in each race you have only five reboots.
If you've gotten rid of it, it's all going to go away.
So the rest are more like a means of helping, for if something doesn't work out, but you shouldn't leave it.
Sometimes, however, it doesn't help the restart, because nothing else helps us learn the critical section from the head.
Speaking out is unacceptable that the same things often happen at the same place.
Some curves, for example, have to be carried out in a very specific way and in a way, otherwise you just don't fit through.
On the other hand, you always meet "civil" cars at the appropriate location in the same configuration, no matter whether you arrive as first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially embarrassing in situations when you see that the opponent happens in front of a player of two coming cars, but until you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to turn them around or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, everything is so designed that it always comes close to this situation before your nose.
The competitors have further advantages.
Throughout the game, there are a few places where you will always be overcome by the same opponent and even here again without looking back at the moment.
At the crazyest, this is for the end of the game on the long bridge that happens in the opposite direction.
The opponent has to get out of here one obviously on the devil.
And if he's already in front of one, then, of course, he's taking a look, so he starts driving his own car a couple of times in Klump.
Of course - you want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this idea is so clear that it will soon lose the joy of the game.
And that's bad, because despite a simpler driving model, the game is generally quite contented and, in fact, loaded with action so that you don't even know where one of the heads is.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what's "debt" about it - the concept of fifty unique routes, the order of the race in a way that no long paths can come up, or something else...
An unusual idea is also the car exchange during the race.
You can't ignore the tanks on the road, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car will be enough, which you just have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American Limouses for the right cars and exotic super sports cars for the technical vehicles, such as the serpentins in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the game history mode goes also the task mode (i.e. challenges) - so the race in the different locations that you know from history.
Here there are not only medals, but also points of experience for your own profile, which is common to the tasks (the challenges) and history.
To get to the highest level of driving, different items need to be closed: start from the car to the background for the profile.
This is also connected to the online function Autolog, which compares, among other things, the results of its own results with the other players and also provides for other collective functions.
One of the more incomprehensible cutters is a situation in the last race of history.
This is where you arrive with the car in an u-road tunnel (meanway), where you stand in the dark on the skis (meanway).
On the tacho, look at figures between 150 and 200 km/h, but there comes an u-road at once from the back and leads to a compromiseless break.
In our edition we may still be arguing about whether this was a blackout of the player or whether the authors were so bloody.
The technical page is nothing overwhelming, but at least the visual overall impression is quite appealing in most cases and even brilliant here and there.
So it's ironic that at some exciting moments, the image spreads slowly, and it's rather dramatic.
However, this is the case with a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS is not useful.
The playback is as far as O.K. and the soundtrack is a taste case.
In an effort to reach as wide as possible a young audience as possible, a soundtrack was created "from everyone" - but who buys such a game because of music already?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are more mixed.
If the game wasn't measured by the total unnecessary error mentioned above, we could have claimed with the Brustton of the conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game works somehow.
Enjoy a class, but you should be prepared to make this mistake with the power of airport cameras.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negatives and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the equal weight of the individual institutions from the Lot."
I wouldn't have expected such a hard war to end."
"It will last for five or six years until the wave is cooled and everyone has become accustomed to their new role," Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, began to give his speech to the legal faculty.
As she took seriously the motto "Responsively and openly about Europe", she had already shown in the first part of her speech that she was able to describe the individual bodies of the EU and their relations with each other in such a transparent and understandable way that she would have been able to explain so many readers of the University of Karls University.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:
"In the beginning it was critical that he was too innocent - a grey officer who had not been raised such a role, but I have to say that it has struck the spirit as well as he has taken the matter.
"It is a person who is ready to listen patiently to seventy-seven Member States to communicate with them and who has, above all, clear ideas on how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained as an answer to the question: Who is it - the European Union? What number should I call?", so as an important step to agree and improve the sustainability of EU policies against countries, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from our oil cook Quargel.
Ms Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda, which the European Union had lived, lived and thought about in the near future.
Two years ago, the Czech Presidency called it a success.
The Czechs had hosted the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also held the summit for Eastern Partnership.
The case of the Government during the presidency was described as a major negative that had seriously damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU now has to do everything in its power.
With the words of the messenger, it was not only at the presidency but also at the coming crisis that has not yet been overcome.
And then the EU's seven-year budget must be approved, which makes the matter much more complicated because of the current economic situation.
Whether it will be a slender and sparse budget, what economic priority will be given, what countries will be promoted more and less - all of this is now on the agenda.
The messenger also remembers her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "Constantly about Europe".
"If I don't like anything, then there's terrible screams, strangers and professionals who don't understand.
As a citizen, how should I know whether in Brussels you really think of the rough or round churches and various large bananas or if you really want to ban the quargel?
It would also like to use the EU's soil to get more checks in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
According to the EU messenger, the Czechs are calling for Eurosceptics to be more negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is therefore more impressive.
There are many factors, including the retention of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters and not least the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also supported the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, which was also mentioned above.
"Believe me if a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is near, then the French next to me says, "He, what do you put your heads together - is that your V4 already?" and makes a very expensive mine.
Ms Vicenové therefore expects the EU in the future, above all, to lay down strict rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.
As much more realistic, as a 'European federation', it reflects the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have here the countries of the euro area and the countries outside the euro area.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of enhanced cooperation."
"The first time it was said that only the countries who want it and those who don't want it should be left alone."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will eventually pass on a strong "Europe of the Various Speeds", expects Mrs Vicenová.
In this regard, it also respected the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in implementing the principle of subsidiarity, which is said to have to be addressed throughout the EU by all Member States and not only by the countries of the euro area.
Brand Story:
Innovator IBM begins in the second century of its existence
If you wanted to look for a suitable word that the strategy of IBM would be the most accurate, then this would probably be the word "longevity".
For the broad public IBM is the Synonym for technological revolution, known as a modern company, although it has been a century since its foundation.
The basis for this longevity was already her first head - the visualist Thomas J. Watson.
He has already left the Slogan, payless world problems to be solved easily if people were ready to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" became so marked that it should play the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the company's internal journal, which was released at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the company culture originally prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was therefore successful for a whole century because it has remained faithful to its principles and did not hesitate to change everything else.
This allowed us to transform technologies, business and society throughout our first century.
We hope that we will make more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmsano, today's director of the company at the time of the Jubilee.
Expert system
What has already worked on the social care of his employees in the thirty years - in a similar way as the Băa entrepreneur in Czechoslovakia: IBM people had a holiday paid as one of the first American employees, insurance by entrepreneurs plus elegant uniforms as employment clothing and a comprehensive system of remuneration for the best newers and dealers.
The long-term relations of IBM with their customers are equally cleared.
The company was in a great position to promote talent - as one of the first companies in the world, IBM had any discrimination - and could look at it accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan, the Palmisan will be replaced by a woman in the next year - by Virginia Rometty.
It has been in IBM for thirty years until it has taken over the position of the vetriebs, marketing and strategic capital.
In recent years IBM is making so-called online business distortions, from which many future strategies and innovations have grown.
No wonder - there are enough ideas in the company, almost half a million people are employed.
An institution with a good reputation
Your unsuspecting position in the business ensures the company a strong image, which goes inside and outside.
"From the beginning IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said economist Professor Harvard Business School and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems with technology," added George Colony of Consulting-Forrester Research.
As the company points out, it is a difference only to be present on the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logos for family "Big Blue", has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in one century.
It is one of the most diverse technology companies - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consulting services in an incredible range of products - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies IBM owns most patents and already five of its employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
Its most famous inventions include car rentals, credit cards, financial swaps, strip codes or even the discs.
With some 220 billion dollars (market capitalisation) this year IBM was the second largest technology company (as well as Apple), where it was first over Microsoft since 1996.
Preview
Not all products and innovations have experienced the taste of customers today - unfortunately, for example, the temptation with their own OS/2 operating system, the online service Prodigy or also the IBM PC jr computer.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you must not be emotionally attached to the past," says Samuel J. Palmsano.
Therefore IBM has no problem building its foundation walls on different platforms - and if they do not work, it will also leave them.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft, who stands and falls in principle with his Windows operating system.
Successful technologies
IBM's winnings involve most services, software and hardware in each five.
In 1990 hardware was still the strongest representative of more than fifty percent.
Since 2000, IBM has sold a small share of assets worth $15 billion, but at the same time it invested $58 billion in the purchase of future powerful technologies.
In these investments IBM also continues after 2008, when the current financial crisis first hit the world as a storm.
Here IBM also believed in the memory of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who raised his investment in the middle of the great global economic crisis.
To date, IBM seems to be in the process of overcoming today's crisis.
The value of IBM shares has increased dramatically by 120 per cent since 2008 and the company's profit increase continues.
IBM's corporate log: everything can change - just not the values.
That is why it can also be expected that this flexible giant is also the next crisis.
IBM history: From the catacombs to world planes
The company IBM (International Business Machines) founded in New York 100 years ago had a fairly complicated name - Computing Tabulation Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took over only in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a download in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone for later IBM laid the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s of the 19th century.
They have technologies, such as the famous card years to register the beginning and end of work.
To the architects of this new company, Charles Ranlett Flint, who had also been in the Board of Supervisors by 1930.
And it was Flint, who appointed Thomas J. Watson's head of the competition company to help him lead the company.
This leader even put the founder of IBM in the shadow - based on Watson's ideas, the company's invisible culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, began, as the name already exists, with the production and distribution of all possible machinery for the trade - from Wurst-and-Case cutters up to cash.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company expanded beyond and beyond all continents.
Watson was so inappropriate for the company that he spent 14 years in the capital, first he was dissolved by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
This led IBM to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM engineers and computers of NASA fly to All - to Mercuri and Saturn, and in 1969 the famous flight of humans to the moon.
In 1964 IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that determined the computer standard of that time came in 1981 under the name IBM 5150 on the market.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand, but bought the consultant part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus increased completely and completely in the business with consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that has been paid for IBM in the last three years is the concept "Smart Planet".
It forces the intention to introduce technologies in blind ways in unplanned areas, e.g. to improve the situation in transport and urban administration.
In the trade sector IBM recently introduced the "Smart Trade" platform to help dealers lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in Chechnya.
In 1932 IBM established a download in the then Czech Republic - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brünn.
The central centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, and here is also a world-wide top-level research team that includes voice recognition technology.
Darina Rüchtářóvá about her inner gates:
Iveta - this eagle can keep you, I don't want it anymore!
Darina rychtářóvá (53) says - now is the end!
After her husband, Josef rychtár (53) became the guardian of Iveta Bartosšová (45) to his lover, Darina remained the hope that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it has finally passed with patience, and for the next life she has set clear rules.
"Joseph can come home, but no more than my partner," explained D. rychtářóvá.
When Darina rychtářóvá of the singer I. Bartosšová had ordered access to her own house, she probably wouldn't even fall into the dream as it does with her husband.
When Iveta went on her drive after 30 days and returned to Ríčány, Joseph went with her.
Yes, he even publicly knew that he loved her.
In time, Darina redesigned, and it seemed as if she wanted to marry her trusted husband again - but now she finally gave him the pass.
Rychytár is equal to who his wife sleeps with
If he should leave Iveta Bartoshová in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms.
"He is the biological father of my dreams, and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not pursue him."
"However, not as a beloved, troubled old esal, but as a person I still have certain connections to," said Mrs. Rychtářóvá; but she also said that she had been emotionally separated from him and existed alone on mutual jurisdiction.
The condition that Darina has given him the back door is still worth it.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I stay with Iveta, nothing changes."
"My wife wants a paper wedding and I want to respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the plot, I buy."
"With Darina I kept myself very normal, only the bed we don't share," said J. rychtár (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn't want to stop them.
"We don't sleep with each other, so I don't care if she has a friend or who it is.
I'm clear that it's my fault that I fell in love with Iveta and that's why I take every responsibility.
The worst female suspects: What's wrong with you?
If men are asked to name some typical female twins, they will shoot some prompts out of the womb.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself again in the following lines, in which we are going to pass a few unscientific Revues again, which pour the blood into the adrenals?
Shopping
Do they expect their boyfriend to be marketable?
Do you have to buy at least a hat every week?
Do you want to go shopping and can it be a little more?
Then in your case it's probably going to be a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of it and try to keep their loss of shopping half-way under control.
But what woman's hand on the heart, which woman already seems to be looking for a good seating clothes just to burn through a dress business and not try all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even if shopping for most women is a hobby, for men it is often the pure hell.
But once they tell her how often they've told her husband - you've been out of love...
Standard Dissatisfaction
"Am I not too thick?"
"I had to give up at least five kilos - should I start joging or gymnastics?"
"May I ever fall on you?"
Do they know anything about it?
Yeah?
Then you may also belong to the women who are legally entitled to what they look like.
This does not mean that you should leave, but many men react allergicly when their wife is constantly sorry about her appearance.
The stronger sex is a few - with the increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly unchallenged.
Organization and purity at first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Put windows, tiles and dust away, when they jump - and this is at least twice a week.
Swimming with her partner, because once again he sprinkles dirty shoes on the clean liquids, you beat the children because the newly cut wash basin is already drunk and because the glass in the living room has already printed fingerprints, but where does the police make it so much possible?
If you suffer under this kind of "diviance", then you should know that nothing can be exceeded and that the order and cleanliness in family life are not at the top.
In the end, this unsanitary cleaning plant can also damage the opposite relationship and especially the peace in the family.
Scale
"The dirty turnhoes come into the trash bin."
"Do you really want to pull the old socks again tomorrow?"
"A nasal glove doesn't just fall on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a Tirade, you should not be surprised that it brings him to the palm.
Of course, that doesn't mean bad, but they just want everything to be done.
If the men knew that, the women may not have to struggle so much.
Klatsch and Tratsch
Some women would like to laugh and hug because behind the back, they will be showered or even hurt or hurt the bonds.
Women are now focused on relationships, which is why they like to discuss such topics, such as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Well, each of us women has a little unharmed klatsch and tratsch on the warehouse.
Hands on the heart - that's probably all women's own.
But this is not to be confused with the most terrible calibers, which are nothing and no one is holy, which seems to be everyone in their environment, and which poses a serious threat especially to women in the collective community.
Jágr and Voráček defeated Philadelphia with their assistants to win
The Eishockeysturmer Jaromír Jágr had two assistants in the NHL at the Montags game on the 5rd side of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and is therefore the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
One of the users of the 19-year-old Eishockeystar's review was Claude Giraux, who added an assistant and was invited to the best player of the match.
Two assistants in the same game also named Jágr's player Jakub Voráček.
Jágr claimed after the game Journalists argued against him that he had a great prophecy tonight.
"Just before the game, I'm telling him that he's got a hittrick today."
I felt it somewhere."
"He and again overcomes such a feeling," Jágr explained, after his action Giroux had already reached a tower at the first panel of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech trail".
Voráček fought the puck behind the gate of the Hurricanes and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
One second before the first third off, the home player Patrick Dwyer achieved a short hand, but then the second third belonged to the Flyers again.
Special Girox.
In cooperation with Jágr, he reached his third hit, then Wayne Simmonds linked his shot to the fourth door.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player of the League, but he's definitely one of the best three," Jágr said his center.
"I wouldn't feel like I was playing with such an Eishockey player at the end of my career like him."
"I'm so glad."
"I cut my game on me."
"All the years in the NHL my players put their game on me and now the rain turns around," Jágr whispered.
Carolina was still playing the drama - through the encounter with Tuoma Rutua and once again two of them who were transferred from a criminal committee, it came up to a door.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complications in which he was successful in counting two against one.
"Excellent pronger was still active in our area."
"He raised the puck, I drove up and (read) went to remote pfostos."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad he's fallen asleep," Voráček described the last encounter of the party from his sight.
By this victory, Philadelphia was at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech opponent of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček was injured in the game against Buffalo and shot in the second half because of an injury to the upper body.
The Canadians, in addition to their experienced Beck, also had their leadership an infamous in Penalty Shoes 2:3.
One of the crimes could not change Tomáš Plekanec.
More than the lost points hurt the trainer of the home community, perhaps the high-skilled accident in the defensive - the game was only playing with five reverse players to the end.
"That's bad."
"The encounter we only played with one experienced player at the end, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing we can do to get done," said Jacques Martin.
"In every exchange, one attack wave after the other, and we had nothing to do with it."
"We would have made the game easier and had to get the puck out of our third."
Here there are still reservations," said P. K. Subban, one of the players.
The Czech torhuter Ondréj Pavelec cut out thirty shots of Tampa Bay and thus contributed to 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
On the gates of the jets, which thus ended a series of five floors, had five different shields.
Development of travel prices since 1989
By 1989 there were only five state travel offices available in the former ČSSR: Čedok, sports tourism, CKM, recreation and car tourism.
The travel offices were then selling mainly trips to the socialist Eastern bloc countries, and in the West only had to be selected.
And so Czech tourists travel to the Baltic (in the German Democratic Republic - the DDR), the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Black Sea), Bulgaria and Romania on the Black Sea and Hungary on the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia entered a test course and therefore the journey to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A big paradox of socialist times was that it was not even allowed to travel freely within the socialist countries of the Eastern Block (also the Czech Slovaks).
If, for example, a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Once again, the travel offices also started travelling in the west, but they had to buy huge snakes or even stay in bed before the travel office, or at least have "good-known" in the travel office.
That's what it's been like for a long time.
The so-called dividends - the condition for a trip in the West - were only given "politically reliable" people - the others were not even allowed to travel.
The Czech-Slovakia currency was not a free exchange currency, therefore it would have been impossible to raise the necessary financial resources (first currency) for a trip to the West.
Therefore, most of the other Czechs sold their holiday in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekly houses and dates - a habit that continues to this day.
The total revolution of 1989 followed a revolution of the Czechs on foot.
While a holiday in the DDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of everything by 1989, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their abroads in countries around the world.
A violent paradox, which is no longer known today, is the fact that it was not possible to travel in the most popular holiday country in the Czech Republic until 1989 because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Since the beginning of the 90th century, the dividend obligation has been raised in the neighbouring Western European countries, leading to a violent wave of short visits mainly to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough time from their journey to the west, everyone wanted to be there for at least a few days.
Thus, the Czech passengers travel to Paris in the Zelt in the park, because who had already had the money for a accommodation in the hotel or in a pension.
A typical feature in Czech travel was once a full-packed coffee room with condoms, beer and duration.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the free exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the western currency.
Our standard of living, as well as our average levels, are rising, which in 1997 resulted in another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, after 1997, the travel offices began to prepare regular trips by charter flights, thereby allowing the flights to be treated by multiple discounts, in comparison to the past, unliquidated.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, had already had separate payouts with all the highly developed countries of the world, which made travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of the "post agency" travel came in 2000, thanks to the high demand for the first direct charter flight in an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers fly to far-off sunny countries; this year you fly directly from Czechia to 12 exotic destinations.
To the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel every year in exotic countries!
Another important moment in the era, which marked our post-evolutionary development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, which finally led our country to join the highly developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs sold more than half their vacation abroad (50.3%) for the first time in their history, including the costs of the holiday resort more than 15 TZK per head.
The main meeting is to find a new president - again a pact.
For almost five months, the Czech football has no president, and it is feared that Ivan Haszek's successor will not be known at the top of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) once after the extraordinary main assembly on Thursday in Nymburg.
To date, there is no agreement on which evaluation is to be chosen.
And without this, there is absolutely no vote on the three potential consequences.
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hashek returned from his function, where he had urged his colleagues to find a few and a strong personality that could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the æra to Hashek the old corridors between the two connection chambers are re-examined, which cannot be passed on to a joint candidate.
This was clearly and clearly shown on 16 September when the new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the main assembly were quite different from the people's house in Prague, where the negotiations did not lead to results, and this was not just about the choice itself.
In other words, it was not possible for some who were actually voting in the plenary - only the legislative representatives or the officials who were empowered with full authority.
In this single point, at least partially agreed, which also contributed to the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, whose opinion was not based on a representation on the basis of full power.
However, the disputes about the monitoring continue.
Nor did the Executive Committee make any further clarification on the matter at its meetings - no matter whether it is proper or extraordinary - in principle there is nothing else in the agenda.
Even if the views regarding the choice changed a few times - the neural point remained the same.
The question arises: how should you proceed in round 3 to avoid a patent situation?
"The issue concerns whether to proceed in accordance with the sentence or whether a completely different model must be found," Dušan Svoboda, one of the three chairpersons of the FAČR, pointed out in the management of the professional football.
According to the legal model, in the third round of the candidate, who receives the largest percentage of support in the chamber for which he is applying.
Walls are likely to agree on the compromise that the candidate who receives the highest number of votes from both chambers.
Again, the Czech side is on the condition that the winner receives at least a secondary majority in this percentage of votes.
"Then the two rounds have no sense at all, this mode would question the whole two-room concept," Svoboda understands the impressions of the Maori side, which at best does not add the rating, but choose a valid setting.
Tomáš Paclík agrees with this too, although it is said that the statutory evaluation of all candidates is probably contrary to Pelta at first.
"My wish is to be widely chosen after the sentence."
"In order not to be considered by any unreasonable substitutes, as at the last main meeting," explained Victoria Plzeň, the owner (the football club) who first applied and held a stand against Pelta in his opinion.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new president will be known in Nymburg and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the National Mission for Football-EM today would certainly help to ease the fears."
"If the football is only on the euphoric well, then there is also a greater willingness to cooperate," says the staff member from Jablonec, who brings the greatest experience of all three adoptees and this at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl's back there.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is different."
"This is not a matter between the people of the mountains and the mountains, but there are certain efforts to "right" the rules for their own purposes."
"This is why a new blockage in the main assembly is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that the healthy human mind will finally see," said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time to take all the pages away.
Some negotiations should probably be played directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether football will be complete until the qualification game is complete.
The charter aircraft, which was supposed to fly to Podgorice, including Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, was not able to start in Prague in the morning because of a technical disturbance, and it was as if we were looking for a replacement to take a part of the Executive Committee as well as to the exit site of the Barrage game.
Finally, however, the meeting at ministerial level is crucial to arrive on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister for Education, Youth and Body Training, would like to move the split parties within the country's largest sports association.
It is very much on the game: state applications, the credibility of the Czech football and also the forthcoming main assembly of the ČSTV, which will show the Czech sport following the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes into the fight about the position of the president because he does not see suitable candidates
If Tomáš Paclík, head of the Pilsner football club prior to the extraordinary meeting, could have made a strong candidate who had fulfilled all his suggestions on the new president of the Czech Republic's football league (FAČR), he would not have been involved in the struggle for this high position.
"If there were any good advisers, I would fight for him and abandon the choice."
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an approach," said Paclik ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go to Duell with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is therefore to prevent the alleged favor of the choice, Pelta, to the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that in the event of his victory, he considers the President's role only for a year, so until 2013, until the end of the regular meeting.
In the position of the president, he would like to see an experienced top manager who is not very involved in football.
"I have personally spoken to some people asking questions."
"I can't believe that some told me they didn't want to identify themselves with the Czech football.
"I'd like to change such views," he said.
In most cases, Paclík argues that the association of Pelta's with the president of the Pillsner District Ball Association, Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial call, which is regarded as a powerful lobbyist, has the ability to influence delegates' votes at major meetings.
For Paclík it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta would have taken the position of the President.
"With his victory, today's status would be preserved and in the Czech football it was never before."
"The support by Berbr, a smart businessman, doubles the football,” Paclik stressed.
In this way he also argues that Pelta's name fell in connection with telephone interruptions for detection in a corruption case, however, from the Pelta was criminalized.
"I don't know what prestige should bring a victory from Pelta to the football game."
"And how would we get into the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said earlier, "who will sell the Pilsner Football Club if Pelta presidents are going to be", but he sees something more relaxed.
If Paclík should be seen in the Donnerstaval, however, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported the Pacík before the main assembly in October, ended with a Fiasko.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could imagine him, for example, as head of the National Union."
"But I don't think he's able to lead the connection as a manager."
"I don't get my nose out of things that I don't understand," said Paclík, who had made it appear in September to him that he was standing at the top of the trial committee with Luděk Macela, replacing the Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself asserts that he was growing up in the role of the President of the Alliance.
And he is called upon for his ability to lead private companies, since last summer he is also chief of Pilsen, who celebrated the first triumph in the League with his support in May.
"I have the power to change something in football environment and contribute to a certain culture."
"To limit the influence of certain interest groups, which tend to influence discipline and professional commissions, which has led to adverse situations," Paclík pointed out, who does not make a difference from his antipathy, for example, against the Sparta Chief Daniel Krétínský.
As one of his priorities, he saw the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, which would help him to lobby for more money from the lottery competition in sport.
"This is one of the crucial things that the new president should turn to."
"When it comes to the control of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but they also have to climb and tell clearly where the money goes," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club also does not seem to be a handy, although he himself insists that the president of the FAČR should be "transpartial".
Pelta is again connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prager Dukla.
"That's not just ideal."
"It does not make much sense, however, to transfer my shares to the Pilsner Club to a third person in order to return after a quarter of a year," Paclík said.
Pelta promised new settings of the FAČR that would exclude a Patt situation in the future.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Federation, one of the candidates for the presidential appointment, Miroslav Pelta, will make it strong in the event of his election that the FAČR will come to new status, which will end in future disputes over the evaluation of the former.
The jablonec staff is confident that the elections will be held in Nymburg before Thursday's negotiations and believe that the election will be successful if the Czech election is successful.
Pelta had already promised to focus on the national community and the acquisition of financial resources in September.
Only at the last moment did he decide to participate in the election before the last major assembly, and he was able to help him take the two-month break to defend his ideas on the guidance of the football and in a broader context.
"People at all levels turn to football, they are impatient and expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is the highest time for the relationship to be directed by someone, he thinks that the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonese Club has also been active for many years at Sparta and in the Executive Committee.
That is why he also believes that he has enough experience to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that today's problems with the election are the euphoria that prevailed in times of Ivan Hashek.
"In June the General Assembly was approved, which was not as perfect as it had all been adopted.
If they did not allow different explanations, we had already had a president since September," Pelta said.
As soon as the main document of the Civil Society was recast, he used it as a means of lockdown for the delegates.
"If I should be president, then I will take it personally and I am ready to take responsibility personally if it does not fall."
"That's a principle thing without which he can't be," says Pelta.
Furthermore, he does not try to limit himself to his competitors.
He had already announced that he could have a cooperation with Jindrích Rajchl, whom he recognized for his legal education and he knew well that his opponent's candidate would be his first representative.
Tomáš Paclík has not been arrested for a long time, but he has not left any dry fad on Pelta.
In the football he has been moving for over a year and can already point to some success."
"But his attacks were devastating, and many people were shocked by his campaign of election."
"And that's why many now doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his opponent, who probably remained faithful to his announcements, which he had already heard in September.
According to his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lower classes to the national team.
And this should be the excuse for the Czech football.
"I would also try to end all the deviations - from the cause of the Bohemians, to the consequences of the corruption scandal of the past year."
"At the same time, I would run into negotiations with the private and public sector to ensure sufficient financial resources for the entire football," said the six-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time, he also promised that his entry into the top of the Czech football won't mean any personal exercises.
"I had to trust myself first with the contents of all the employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where, because of the long anarchy, it seems reasonable to overcome nervousness.
Despite these catastrophic scenarios, which accompany the current main assembly, he believes that the delegates do not travel to Nymburg on Thursday.
"If we really should be the only fight point, as you choose in the third round, then we'll go."
"The football needs credibility and it only wins it back when it finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his functional career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will begin to work hard under him
If the President-in-Office of the Czech Republic, Jindrích Rajchl, who was previously represented at the General Assembly on Thursday, were to be elected to the new president of the football league in the Czech Republic, many people would apparently refuse to vote.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in the event of his election.
He wants to introduce system changes and take responsibility for the members of the Executive Committee for individual football fields.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemian case to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to raise more money in the football and to continue the work that Ivan Hashek, the former president, has begun.
"As president, I want to turn the football as a whole."
Take from the international contacts to UEFA and FIFA, via the national election, the professional football, to the service football for young people."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything by myself," said Rajchl in the ČTK speech.
"I am a team player and therefore I would like to share the expertise of the Executive Committee so that each member is assigned a certain area."
And I'm going to distribute hard tasks so that the football will come in every segment with mileage."
Many would not just be impressed because they had to start working hard themselves instead of just criticising the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, they have considered no longer to be candidates.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, who don't want to throw a couple between my legs and every step I take," he said as a statement why he was late.
"Many people told me I couldn't stand up because there would be others to do."
"That's trust you can't play," he said.
Apparently, he also encourages him to continue the work he began under Hashek.
"In two years we've been working a lot of hard work, and I don't want to just throw it away."
"It was started processes, which probably only came into force in a few years and I would just see that someone stopped them," he thought and expressed his concern that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be chosen to return the situation in the days ahead of Hashek.
"I believe in systematic actions and that's something that Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"The people behind him, above all, who would make the football so that he would only be elected there."
I can't think of anything, but not that I'm a part of it."
"I try to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because it's all going well and not just the chosen ones," noted Rajchl.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a president of the Czech Republic.
"Even if some people claim the opposite, I really have the best option to do for fish."
"For example, it is time to pass whether one should not share the League in a Czech and a murky part, whose winners will then ascend into the first League."
"Then it couldn't happen that today only three major clubs play in the League, which is especially a problem for young players in the streets," says Rajchl.
Since the chief of the Pilsner Club Tomáš Paclík has now joined the struggle for the role of the president, Rajchl does not hesitate to appreciate his chances of being elected.
"I look forward to a strong support in the Czech Chamber which has chosen me to its vice-presidents and now recognises that clear success lies behind me," Rajchl pointed out, who also considers the savings of a hundred million crowns for unpretentious contracts, the agreement on television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as its success.
On the other hand, he owes himself part of the debt that the bond does not belong to a single strangler.
While he says from Pelta, "who is primarily disqualified to help the Czech football to trust new confidence," he maintains the second Rivalen - Paclik for a strong candidate who has really offered the football something.
"No one can question that he has worked in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were to be elected, then he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hashek has introduced, and he would obviously not change the staffing in the Commission."
He would certainly not want to give things to his own interests," Rajchl explains about his rivals.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Spring in Blue
From Julia Stanek
Plankbeken in Ufo-Optic, Prunkpools in Budapest: Anyone who travels through Europe can experience his blue wonders - and after a city tour or a trip, the soft legs in spring beds.
A book shows where wellness in the water is the most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip in the last half of the years, one had to not miss her bag: her bath access.
Backing on the water, she looked high in artificially designed dolls, they stood against soft marble doors waiting on them at the back of the bucket, and stood over acrylicly restored youth style swimming pools.
She picked up a bathroom, and she picked it up quickly in her notebook - as well as valuable details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 Swimmbangers have learned the architecture history of Meder in this way - and now introduces it in their very own book "Badegraden": Volkswimmhalen in Munich, historical bathrooms in the Black Valley, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in Taunus.
Through 13 countries, she led her "Travel to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and in each case a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a real Badecultural enthusiast.
With sports, she didn't have much on the hunt, says Meder - only in the water is the other one.
Interestingly, swimming fans have to be found with blue caps and chlorine, while jogger can catch the polluted scent of fatty forests or light bird nests in the park.
"I asked myself one day why Swimming beds should always be so hot," says the girl who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths."
Water surface duplicated architecture
The wellness factor in baths is therefore so large because all senses are served, so honey.
And if the builders have given their power, swimming may be a real sight: "The state of a foothold has a surface of water in the baths."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles optically: high fuel, hot boilers, spring brakes.
The small-information image band "Badegraden" provides 190 pages of knowledge about the architecture and cultural history of the historical wellness-Oasen - but above all, makes fun of a spring in the blue.
Remarkable specimens discovered the pool collector Meder in his search in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent health baths such as the 100-year-old Szechenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrousated water in an uurine Karsthöle (Höhlenbad in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath filled with alkaline water and located in a bottle-formed building (Városio Termáfürdö in Jassberény).
Spectacular views, however, offer many heated outdoors in Switzerland and Austria: While you have the whole city in sight from the Züricher Dachbad, you can look out at the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton on the snow-covered Arlberg - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can watch the ride on the ski pista.
The most unusual pool design can be expected by Badegeste in Langgenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks just like a Ufo in the Alps.
From three to three open rocks, it falls in the winter, while the mountains of the Ötztal in the sky are in the background.
Alhambra in Black Zald
Not in any swimming pool, the pool collector Meder of the smell of chlorine rose into the nose.
Many thermal baths flow to Schwefel, in the Árpád-Bad in the Hungarian Békescsbasa, it is so strong that it is rarely believed to be landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkaline-hydrogen carbonate-containing Heil water, which is almost black and its effect on the skin, as soon as you can walk into the basin - a wellness experience of the special kind.
In one place, Iris Meder was also disappointed at her search for beautiful bathrooms: when she wanted to visit the free and sun bath in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, she found a blocked terrace.
The bath designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed.
As the girl looked through the windy window of the red-white- yellow youth-style building, she saw how unkrout rose between the tiles.
In contrast, the event was held in a beautiful swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three stages have already been behind this bathroom; not only can you discover the neuromanic elements that originated from its creation in 1844, but also a maurial hall in Alhambra style, which was added about 1900.
Since the careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal is the favorite bathroom of the pool-kenner Iris Meder - and this is not just because it originally comes from the black wall.
"It's already a performance to mix so different structures to such a great unit," says Meder.
At such a palace, the decline in the thermal pool appears to be just another cause.
Agra-Speculation
Deutsche Bank allows raw materials business to be clarified
From Christian Teavs
Does the Deutsche Bank cancel your business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEBEL-Online information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the impact of speculation on the world's poor.
In January, the company head wants to take consequences.
Hamburg
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the matter is clear: 84 percent of the Germans find it unacceptable that banks with agricultural raw materials such as whites or maize are speculating.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that the German Bank and other credit institutions grow out of this business, as it strengthens the problems of the doctors of the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the Consumer Organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by the footwatch in mid-October.
In this regard, author Harald Schumann points out that the weather on the global raw materials runs the prices high - and that is why banks are guilty of the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is directed specifically against the German bank chief Josef Ackermann, even if large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
In the past, raw materials laws were intended to ensure traders against price changes.
In the meantime, however, most experts agree that the sugars have been removed from supply and demand - and at the cost of the most medical benefits.
Unlike the US competitor, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to check the merits and said that no business would be "valued to put the good reputation of the German bank on the game".
According to information from SPIEBEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the requirements of the Footwatch report.
By the end of the year the test should be completed, then the results will be presented to the Board of the German Bank - as well as a recommendation on how to proceed.
At the end of January, the bank wants to inform the banks of the consequences.
At the end, a reduction in the raw material business could be, or even the complete withdrawal.
Ackermann restored his image
Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the message, but also confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The rising prices of food are particularly tragic as banks today are damaging the general well."
Ackermann is now the Chief Bankenlobbyist, especially now in charge.
"The Deutsche Bank must strip all installations from its portfolio, where money for weather is used at food prices," said Bode.
"No matter whether Mr. Ackermann is leading hungry people or the German bank's call."
Ackermann's view comes at the first glance, but it is clear that the company chief wanted to give a perfect picture a few months before his departure from the office.
On Monday, the German Bank announced that the head of the Board would not change to the Board of Supervisors otherwise than planned.
By turning away from the controversial speculatory, he could improve his image.
And in order to get his way, he hardly needs to be ashamed - so he would have to be his follower.
Each second would destroy raw materials
Footwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
Already more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, the land published the survey for which the Institute of Forsa asked on 7 and 8 November 1001 people.
It is only 11 percent that it is therefore legitimate for the German Bank to offer facilities at which food prices are charged.
Many banknotes would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: Each second would be advertising all the facilities where money flows into the raw material speculation.
43% would have been opened up by such a bank, 49% would have given them to think about preaching their account and moving to another institution.
21st House in Vienna
The around-the-fly Pavilon
From Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with heights, depth and Happy End: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion from Brussels in 1958 received prices, became a museum in Vienna, and became empty and successful.
Now he's reopened as an exhibition house.
When the modern postwar architecture is heated by clear forms, glossy halls, courageous candles and new materials that are typical of the technical progress of faith, the Austrian Pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition is an exciting and famous example.
Swanzers Pavilon was then able to obtain the Grand Prix d'Architectural for its light and moving active steel glass construction.
The building is still known as the Meilenstone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous that he also built Pavilon at the next world exhibition in Austria.
With his legendary BMW-Vierzylinderhouse plus a scytheful nearby in Munich, he was finally internationally celebrated in 1973.
After the world exhibition in the Swiss garden, Pavillon, planned as a temporary exhibition building, was built in 1962 and opened a museum of the 20th century - the "20th House" was called.
The building, however, was not spacious and technically as a museum - no walls to the edge of art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it has been used for so long until contemporary art has come to a new house in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has come more and more down.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has built the Pavilon, now called the "21st house" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
The Museum of Belvedere, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition - a happy event in every respect.
This was the beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted art historian with considerable careers, including in the youth as an iceman, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founder director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, put emphasis on building by politicians and memory defenders, created public funds and private sponsors and established the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the image house were to be performed by the same-named Foundation, a café and a library should be provided, and an office should be built to do so.
Strong supervision, small estatism
For the implementation, Krischanitz was the ideal setting.
Not only because Joseph Olbrich's Secession was significantly built and expanded in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the Pavilon was a "memorial important place" for him, where he looked at the exhibitions "at least every weekend".
He knew the Ur design, and he knew the problems of the building that had already been lost when he moved to Vienna and his use of greatness and ease.
In today's construction, there were far greater problems: the building was "a energy elevator", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glassfassade have been exchanged, glass phaser glass has been used and the glass layer has been replaced by a special safety glass.
Cold brakes have been strengthened or replaced, and asbestos-filled blankets have been cleaned.
Two shootings provided a place for the new use, a cut-off lamp between the house and the street provides for lighting, a bridge leads to entrance - almost a new one, but still the light snower Pavilion.
The original outdoors are left, the house is lined up in the old red-browned Rostguard color.
And the kinosaal is even as accurate as it used to be.
And that's all under strict supervision of the memory authority and with little edat.
"Sometimes a material had to be found, which is good and cheap and also the memory protection has been found," Krischanitz says, pointing to a callable ground in the understatement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and constructions, the building remains flexible and easy.
It is difficult to have been with the Pavilon, "who came from Brussels", has recently said Krischanitz, a typical "Drop-in-the-City History".
Such a architecture is "always in the wrong place" and yet wants to "produce a proper consciousness".
In this case, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because it is a city-building accident: To create the Swiss garden here, the fully-planned " main railway district", with office and housing.
And another happy event may yet occur: The 21st House could be strengthened by another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg purchased the Berlin Temporale Kunsthalle, and as you can hear, she already negotiates with the city about a neighboring place in the Swiss garden.
Railway plant Winter Crisis package in million heights
The train has launched a crisis plan to prevent the flooding in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-conditioned arrivals and delays, the German Railway has reported an additional EUR 70 million this year.
The "Image" site was reported in advance on a group internal crisis plan until 2015, with investments totalling around EUR 300 million.
This will also improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external staff for the cutting edge on railway stations and railway tracks to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free railways up to the start of operation and 90 per cent of the business-use milk within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the head of the Rüdiger Grube had also warned the government and industry of an outbreak and delays in this winter.
In the past winter, the train in passenger transport had serious problems, as it lacked reservations, among other things, under difficult weather conditions.
This is how many new regional trains have been waiting for the approval of the railway agency for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The train has also been making it possible for years to make it possible to check the axles of ICE trains more frequently at the workshop after an ICE in the Kolner main train station had an axle brake.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of penalties in the United States
After the tumult about Chief Josef Ackermann comes new stranger from the United States: The Deutsche Bank has to pay a million boutique there.
If the problems were not enough for the German Bank, the industry still retains its past in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million) in a comparison to contribute to conflicts due to the abundance of five large social banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage papers.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator proposes a whole range of large banks to lead the banks with false agreements for the purchase of financial products; they would have taken the risks down.
Such paper was lost during the financial crisis at great value and the banks grew in depth.
"We are pleased that we could solve the issue without having to bring the parties to court," said a German-Bank speaker in New York.
The bank did not commit any debt with the comparison.
This is also true of the Citi group, which committed itself to the payment of $20.5 million.
The NCUA president, Debbie Matz, welcomed the arrival of the two households.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. Genossenschaftsbanks and is in charge of appeals in order to protect customers' assets.
The NCUA seeks to replace the resulting billions of serious damage.
The comparisons now closed are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also set up other large banks and in summer JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the questionnaire hypothetical paper, it is a so-called Mortgage-backed Security.
These are the basis for home loans.
When the US real estate blassed in 2007, this became a set of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank Lehman Brothers took over.
Even if the events have been a few years back, the banks in the United States are now fighting a fierce wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have insisted on numerous complaints to receive recovery or to order cancellations.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has solved the greatest clause.
It proposes 18 international large banks to have overspended two state-owned US-funded Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac on mortgage business in the amount of about 200 billion dollars.
The German Bank also has to file a complaint from the FHFA, which is worth more than $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that Frankfurter just stand for "substantial losses" without calling an exact sum.
The Deutsche Bank had turned the claims back as a matter of time and explained that they wanted to stay.
Warren Buffett increases by 10 billion at IBM
Financial guarantor Buffett invests powerfully in IT companies IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than $10 billion.
Until then, the large American investor Warren Buffett had always stated not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of companies is only misprognosing.
However, he has now read the business report from IBM and changed his opinion on investments in the industry.
He must have understood much earlier that IBM has provided services and computer systems for the IT distributions of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered to be a hitchlag in the financial year.
Therefore, the IT image of IBM can now be called "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett now realized in the US economy CNBC that he had bought IBM shares in the value of $10.7 billion since March.
Its investmentholding Berkshire Hataway is thus one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said he didn't even know anything about the commitment.
He praised the management that he himself had provided in the economic crisis for good results.
"They've done a great job," said Buffett to the strategy.
IBM has been spending more time on luxurious IT services such as the operation of computer centres.
The more than 100 years old computer pioneer also provides software and advice to powerful business computers.
Buffett had been renting technology companies up to date.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffett caught about in a freight train, in a skirmish or machinery factory.
Its Holding Berkshire Hataway has some 80 own subsidiaries as well as parts of a whole range of large companies such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former Munich Return.
The 81st year, in the 1960s, had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hataway and built it into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his life-style has been compromised.
That is why he is a cult figure for countless employees around the world.
His almost improbable sense of monetary value brought him the name "Omaha's Oracle".
According to the Buffet Investment, IBM's share grew by a percentage.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than 220 billion dollars in total at the market and is therefore among the most valuable technology companies in the world with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, said Buffett, he didn't want to climb.
Founder Bill Gates was a friend.
The threat is improbable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Cell" the German state has doubled the Turkish media.
A newspaper even speaks of a "blood ideology" that now survives.
The murder of eight Turkish immigrants and a Greek retailer between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing background.
This message is addressed in Turkey and within the German population in Germany with fear and anxiety.
Because for many German Turks, this brings back a long-standing burden: Since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing background against Turkey.
However, there was no question of the existence of foreign hostilities in Germany.
However, the right-extremist network, which has been discovered, reveals the dimensions of which are still not visible.
"Is the bloody ideology up again?" titled the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
However, the newspaper "Sabah" stresses that one of the perpetrators should be a V-man of the Constitution, and shows concern that German authorities could also be developed in the legal summit.
The Turkish municipality of Germany reacted in a special way: on the weekend, she recalled the victims of racist violence at the Brandenburg Tower.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish Community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had thought about a festival of the fifth anniversary of the German-Turkey business agreement.
In joyful colors, the intersynthesis was staged - as a story of success.
As an ohrfeige works as the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the fifth" reads the headline of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Nor can the German edition of the "Hurriyet" be taken to draw this thought link.
"It begins to sneeze," says the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people had been murdered, paid taxes and had made an important contribution to rebuilding Germany with their work.
Most critically, the police are discussed in German Internet forums and later in prison.
Why the German authorities are not much more inclined to search for suspects in right-hand circles, the authors are surprised.
At least one shows itself rationally to radical means: "If we continue to fall down here, the migrants remain nothing but self-defence and self-arming."
"It'll probably be the best self-defense."
"From the goodness of the declaration and appropriateness of the punishment of the whole network, the internal peace in Germany depends very strongly on it," says "Sell".
What it means when the inner peace in Germany is in danger, explains the effects of mölls and sunlings in the 1990s.
The photo of Solingen's burning ruins is deeply enchanted in German and Turkish memories.
Because no other event has shown the Turkish living here more clearly that there is a grave threat, and the Germans that may speak of misunderstandings and distance in right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, intensified our feelings on Turkish side.
Undo the last action
In the Turkish press, the failure of the German policy was largely ignored after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Möln.
Following the burning of Solingen, he sent a guide to the Turkish presidents, but he was allowed to be represented on the tour in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel was then quoted in his speech as saying how many duties these Turks had.
It is as if the value of a person is calculated according to the height of his taxes.
The current reporting of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the mystery of many Germans is in the present state of law.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive declaration and reassessment of the right-wing terrorism in Germany, open words are needed this time.
The Scandal Bank of the Zurise
Europe's most ambitious bank is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The BW went into the financial crisis almost bankrupt and either locked from a crisis to the next.
Now it's going to be a German.
That's why Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank in July, it was announced that it would take almost a new job in 2013: Switzerland's President of the Governing Council - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was happy publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and for its new solidarity and made friendly comments on the future colleagues.
"The U.S. has created the tournament."
"I am happy to cooperate with Kaspar Villager and Oswald Grübel."
But in September it became clear that everything would be different.
A trader in London had broken down all the bank security systems and requested around 1.7 billion euros.
U.S. President Oswald Grübel, not just a Swiss famous banker, had to go.
The President of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors has since been appointed - and all questions: When will Axel Weber finally come?
Weber has already been known to advise the Bank of February 2012.
And the Management Board is already taking over in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, more economic professor and notation banker and would certainly have needed a working time.
He then assumes the responsibility for a bank's strategy, which has once again proved that it deserves the title "largest scandal bank in Europe".
Because the UF is huge on the one hand - until recently it was the world's largest asset manager - and has been closing for years from a scandal in the next.
Nothing, it seems, remains such a proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007 the U.S. had an excellent reputation.
The image of the moved and solid but also raised Swiss asset manager had combined it with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very large number in the investment banking.
Thus, the GW 2007 managed, on the one hand, with $1.6 billion more money than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, she was transferred as an investment bank into the League of the world's largest banks.
That made a impression.
The first banker and later long-term bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger told me: "My students have always held the U.S. as a model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, one asks: How could I be so mad?"
He was very angry.
In 2007 it was first revealed that something was owned in the U.S.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli returned with surprise, who so far considered high-tech and equally brilliant banker.
A few months later, the man asked why he had gone.
The Bank's investment party had requested subprimary papers and had to write billions.
To cover this, the U.S. declared a capital increase in terms of words and wrote 13 billion francs.
In fact, she found investors, however, who had been affected by some until shortly before the nose: an intransparable Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so moved that it was not even known its name.
But that was only the first stroke.
It was worse in April 2008.
The Bank had to report new billions of losses, and the Swiss Governing Council, Marcel Ospel, the second most paid Board of Directors in 2006.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the U.S. had to be saved from the collapse of the financial crisis in the face of its failed investment in the financial crisis.
The National Bank bought US$ billion in trouble paper, which the Swiss Eid Society gave six billion francs for a force-sharing loan that they could be the bank's co-owner.
The whole Switzerland was shocked - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when large banks are housed.
Finally, the 2007 balance sheet was more than five times as large as the Swiss economic performance (see chart).
"We couldn't save the U.S. once again," says Banking researcher Geiger.
At the first disaster, the second one was closed.
For a few months now, the U.S. government has capitalised on the U.S. tax conflict and has declared itself ready to issue the data from the available customers, which could have been withdrawn with the help of the Bank of Taxation.
In addition, she agreed to pay 780 million dollars - as a return on unlawful profits from these businesses and punishments.
In order to assist in the tax administration, the U.S.G. was known to be more open or less open.
At the same time, she lost something that had been her capital since she was in the competition for many customers: the Nimbus of weakness.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secrets were no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of the President of the Board and the President of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customers.
Thus, within a few months, the Bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in the investment banking, through speculations and asset management, by aid for tax relief.
And just as it became a little quieter, just as it was thought, the U.S. will now come back, as this unusual story of trader follows: a single dealer asks 1.7 billion euros before the bank notes that something is going on.
And it will be obvious: with the risk management in the investment bank, it is still not obvious.
"In the case of Aboboli, it is necessary to establish that the risk control has changed slightly," says Martin Janssen, Econom and Financial Professor at the University of Zurich.
The financial situation of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem of the U.S. is that it has no risk control."
However, it was precisely the idea of caution that the Swiss bankers had long been involved in becoming victims of the world's great resources: there was no too great risk of security for money - even outside the Alpine Republic could unite the world.
The treasurers of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of irrefutable reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli for especially noble chocolate.
The headquarters of the UG in Zurich is still suitable for the click of the Swiss private bank - it is only a little larger.
The location is already classic.
The bank has its headquarters at the Züricher Train Station, which leads directly from the main railway station to the Zurich Sea, which is covered by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are impressive, the lodges are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry like Tiffany's is found here between Swiss traditional business like the confiscate spring.
For centuries the Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank over the Palace of Credit Suisse to the elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception rate of the U.S. is affected by a heavy duty.
Inside the walls are marbled, before they are thick leather shirts, in addition to the bank logo, there is a great hint for "safe".
The U.S. knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
These ideas of the Swiss Bank have been shared by both Swiss Grand Banks, U.S.A. and Credit Suisse, but at some point they are confused or confused as the head of a Swiss private bank.
He does not want to read his name in the newspaper, but he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the two large banks.
The BW has become too large, especially in the Investment Bank, where the Angelis were also expanding.
The Swiss had nothing to say there.
"And if so, they have adjusted the seats of the angels for a long time."
In fact, it was the English Investment Banking that changed the U.S., which won its first high profits and then the Debakle: no European financial institution has lost as much money as the Swiss Grand Bank in the Subprime-Dschungel.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was seen.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million countries decided the biggest rescue action in the history of their nation," writes author Lucas Hässig in his book "The U.S. Crash".
Up to 68 billion Franks or about EUR 45 billion have allowed politicians to save the large bank in front of the Bank.
How could you get there?
If you talk to Swiss banks, they will see the problem mainly in the size of the U.S.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss Grand Banks joined a violent group.
There was a bank that was already too big for the small Swiss and growing.
It was said that the two different banks of the UFF were complemented: a rich but sleeping bank with the emphasis on asset management in Zurich and a worse but already more internationalized.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment banks came into a lot of money with which they were able to run a huge race.
Two names are related to the rise of the UF: Peter Wuffli, head of the UFB from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the Governing Council.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-tech, reporter, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the man who worked from the bank hall to the top."
But Ospel has finally left himself on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the truth," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragically, maybe.
Of course: Overruns came before the case.
The staff of the WWW clearly remember the leadership contests on which Mr Wuffli repeatedly issued the same password: Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The US bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She pointed to the League Tables, the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
Then the U.S. wanted to go up.
Some steps have already been made.
In the retail business and in the stock trade, she was playing with it all up.
However, corporate consultants who have been commissioned have a weakness: In the international business of interest, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there is a strong distance to the largest banks.
The U.S. mortgage products have gaps.
To close this gap, U.S. took place in an adventure that cost them almost the existence.
According to growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund established before it were invested in American sub-primary facilities.
She developed into a powerful machine, which kept the securities packed and distributed on American mortgage credit - but also held risks.
Even if other banks are long looking for the rise.
"Even in summer 2007, when the American real estate market stood in flame, the U.S. has bought there," says Banken expert Geiger.
The Euphoria is so big, so deep.
One manager had to go after the other when the attempts to escape seemed more difficult than thought.
Posts at the U.S. have been at the key seat and are awake to this day.
Whoever runs the Grand Bank now has a almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has all the accompanying business models.
Bankenforscher Geiger already has an idea: close to the investment banking, focus on the management of assets, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to go this far.
But the investment banking is going to break so hard, so much is now clear.
The next Thursday, the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italian Swiss was actually just thought of as a transitional solution when the bank suddenly broke apart from former Gribel.
In the meantime, he did: he was going to run the business of the U.S., sharing with the Turkish bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to the state in the mid-1990s.
He's playing 3500 stations.
But that won't be enough.
The U.S. needs a vision.
Who is she?
What do they want to earn?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask now.
In public, he says only until he and his wife are going to search for a apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of Restoration in Europe US-Borze
The current recession in Europe has taken the courage of the US investors for the weekend.
The government changes in Athens and Rome remain without force.
The broken industrial production on the continent raised the hopes of stabilising the debt crisis in the Keim.
The general simplification of government change in Rome and Athens could not be implemented.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass had been completely rolled up over half last week, not as half empty - but now the problems were again in the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial values were included in the sales lists.
The Dow-Jones index of the standard values reported a decrease of 0.6% at 12.078 points.
In the course of trade, the market barometer stood between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The larger S&P-500 index was closed at 1251 points, a minus one percent.
Nasdaq's technology source index lost 0.8 percent and went with 2657 points from trade.
In Frankfurt, the Dax was adopted with a minimum of 1.2 percent at 5985 figures.
The industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is moving towards the end of the rise.
In September, companies produced two percent less here than in the previous month, as the Eurostat statistics report.
The US investors sceptically agreed: "We are not an island, but dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to break free as soon as possible, and there will be further signs of weakness in the banks.
The investment leader Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: it is not clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for the end of the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
That is why it would be too early to invest in European state loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett became an age-old principle over the mountains and went into the US technology industry.
His investment over ten billion dollars in IBM supported the company's company's share rate and allowed him to first notice a percentage higher than the trend in trade.
The paper is almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett paid an average of $170 per piece according to his own data and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share rate of its investment firm Berkshire Hataway costs 1.3 percent.
The Bank of America's share was significantly higher than the market by 2.6 percent.
The house silverizes almost the rest of its share at the China Construction Bank and amounts to $6.6 billion for it.
The Institute wants the net profit from the business, above all, to increase its capital rate and therefore to achieve stricter regulatory requirements.
The air carrier Boeing set up and therefore limited the losses in the Dow.
The share won 1.5 per cent after the group had collected the largest order in its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 long-distance machines of type 777 on Sunday and reported the value of the order to 18 billion dollars.
Among other 20 machines options, the volume is even 26 billion dollars.
In New York Stock Exchange, around 710 million shares were transferred to the owner.
719 values added, 2281 returned and 79 remained unchanged.
On Nasdaq, 1,38 billion shares in Plus, 1913 in Minus and 82 were unchanged.
Intelligent races spread out in cities
In many places, satcraments are considered "problems": However, the high-level animals are no longer able to move out of the cities, claiming experts.
The one they like, the other they want to get away very quickly: thieves have been belonging to the city scene for centuries, but in many communities people complain about the pressure and heat of the animals.
This is not a means of combating the "problems" until now.
Saatkrahens were no longer able to get out of the cities, experts said at the first wheat symposium in the East Fries.
There are experts from the entire federal area on possible routes.
You are searching for alternatives in the cities
Natural protection also brought back problems in cities to the landscape of the particularly protected seed crops: the chemical use in agriculture destroyed the traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing construction and the cases of typical grasslands made the birds hard to live.
Crowds are protected by nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 Bruts are located in the west, in the northwest, among others in the winter, Diepholz and Achim at Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for mass murder of cows in the countryside for negative hit lines was provided.
Critics had referred to the catch of animals in birds and the landing of bats as particularly brutal.
"The normal distribution, the collapse, doesn't bring anything," the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver said.
Next with water, or trees fall, often have undesirable consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lah in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals break out, great colonies split up and spread to other places."
Deforestation is only possible as an exception to hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we won't get them away anymore."
Without the change, the problem will not be solved in the cities, my mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
It would be possible to combine animals from sensitive habitats and shelters to share them again in other places.
In contrast, the psychologists and ethnologists Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different treatment with the animals: "A pickel in the face we can end up with the best self-conscious."
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgens founded the Ascheberger Krähen teaching path to inform the indicator about the life of the high-end satikre.
The project will already be adopted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of birds: "There is every amount of communication that has to say a lot."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legible: sandcrows not only use the means to get to a leather bass, but also place their tools even here.
Behavioral researchers at Cambridge University tested at least four satacrenes, as far as the intelligence of birds is concerned.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring a device with stones to the intrusion in order to reach such a battalion.
Without much training, they recognized objectively what size and shape a stone must have in order to enable the platform to be calibrated.
In a second attempt, the pfifies had to solve a more complex problem.
The researchers had placed a small enamel with a mottonarve in a small set of cylinders.
The birds could not reach their prey with the snow.
However, the researchers have been able to help them with their trimmings.
From there all four of the animals formed a hack, with its help they then pulled the eggs out of the herd.
Three of the four satacreans have even been able to help.
Cristian Ronaldo closes Portugal to EM 2012
The hopes of Bosnia and Turkey on a cup remained.
The favorites of Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland are also in the EM 2012.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the latest European Championship tickets in Poland and Ukraine in the playoffs.
Based on the double successful Superstar Cristian Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal defeated Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the five EM participation in the game perfect after the 0:0.
The check was right in the play-off back game at the outside side of Montenegro a 1:0 (0:0), after the game was already a clear thing (2:0).
Not anymore burnt Croatia at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland held a locker 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80).
The former Wolfsburg Bundesliga Prof. Zvjezdan Misimovic with a changed trade diameter (41) and Captain Emir Spahic (65) had doubled for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the Yellow-Rote Map (54.).
Bosnia was already divided into the Playoffs for the 2010 WM in South Africa and Portugal.
At the stadium da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal started to measure.
Ronaldo was hunting for a shower of about 30 metres for early driving into the masks.
A good quarter hour later, Nani showed its width quality and met from 25 metres to 2:0.
The Bosnians who did not take place in the first half hour had their first clear chance by Torjäger Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger of the English Table Leader Manchester City set a headball on the side of the latte, but the ball did not exceed the Torline (33).
Jiracek hits for Chechnya
Next came Judge Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian Strafreum, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese money card (36.).
On the other hand, Stark made a controversial trade route after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who certainly transformed the Misimovic.
After the break, however, the 2004 vice-president made it clear with four hits.
For Chechnya, Petr Jiracek finished in 81. Minutes also the last doubts.
In this way, the European Master of 1976 is following the EM for the fifth time.
However, the crew of trainer Michal Bilek with the Bundesligiga legionaries Michael Kadlek (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Pekhart (FC Nürnberg) had also been lucky and had to be in the early stage for a second.
Schlussmann Petr Cech stopped a possible owner by Thomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the Duo Stefan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the direction of the Stramspace border just passed through the gate of Cech.
After the break, the Quartet had to save the world-class waiter of the Czechs who had already been killed, again the stormers of the FC Seoul (50.).
Finally, the door soon before the end made everything clear.
Turkey therefore missed the football vander of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb didn't get out of a 0:0.
While the National Trainer Guus Hiddink needs to be located at the World Bank of the Third World in 2002, the Croatians can rejoice over their fourth participation in an EM environment.
Before 11,000 visitors at the Maximir Stadium, the Turks had almost had a dream start.
Selcuk Inan met in the seventh minute with a distance committee only the pfostos, attacker Kazim Kazim, could not even break the trigger in the tower.
After a second of the crisis, Croatia took control of the situation.
After the break, the Croats did not burn anything.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made it 62. minutes for the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic, the Bundesliga legionaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Intracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapathon goes to EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated the first EM participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team of trainer Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already provided the 4th success in the game for a preliminary decision, in the 32th minute in charge.
Konstantin Vassilijev (57.) looked out for the guests.
Ireland had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian Border Force prevent the possible leadership target.
In the 32nd minute, it was so far.
After a failed turn of Castleman Pavel Londonak was in position and pressed the ball to 1:0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP invests billions in China in the coming years and wants to double the number of employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) were to be spent, and the Dax companies shared with them on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and set up appropriate staff," Co-Chief Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The company is now expected to grow from about 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of the world market leader's discounts for business software will be doubled from five to ten or eleven.
To date, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of the world's more than 176,000 SAP customers are sitting in the Boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important cornerstone of the 2015 Dax Group strategy.

Mass slaughter at a personal level
A story of the first world war, tells in nine series with a long list of leading people who go to heart.
Here is a tip as you might have done: Cut this page carefully and turn it into your bookmark.
You will get to know these people in England’s romantic story very well. And these main people will work as your GPS, as a light tower in these few moments where you, like England’s men and women, are lost in the middle of the war and your illusions are shattered.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote an unusual book that he did not describe indisputably as "a work of ancient history".
It contains only a few large names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any messengers, exciting reporters or discussions on tactics and equipment.
It's less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was." It's about "feels, impressions, experiences and voices".
"Beautifulness and fear" almost the war experiences of more than 20 or less independent men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountain climbers, doctors, hospital drivers and office staff.
Some of these people are going to hell.
Some will be caught in war, lose weight, be betrayed or killed.
Every one of these lives flaunts how the vocal circuits in one church add some, while others destroy.
England's book weighs down from the ordinary history books.
It also corrects the idea that the first world war was only the glorious war of position on the Westfront.
"Greed and Smells" is an expert view of other places of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
For the soldiers in this book, bees, a celebrated Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, sex flights are an unsolved problem.
This is almost from the beginning of a moving book.
The war overemphasizes the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina, who reigns after Cordit.
Imagine you're a woman who's home with her children and hears cannon fire in the distance. Do you stay or catch the flight?
Who's coming at all?
No one understands what is happening or why this war is being fought at all.
"Consequent facts", says England, "are surrounded by confusion, acceptances, hopes, anxiety, fixed ideas, confusion theories, dreams, alpine dreams and dreams."
"Beautiful and screeching" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German shipmaster.
Their stories were taken mainly by reminders, letters and other material already published.
Their life stories can be shocking or exciting, but they are extremely vivid in England of the small collection that is lost in detail.
Many of them act in ignorance and seek help.
In the story of a German student, he says, "Well, instead."
"Eraszcoffee, false aluminium, false Radier Gummi, paper binding, wood knobs."
He tells more about the replacement in Germany.
He describes "the meat made from pressed rice and was baked in hammock (and lastly served with a false bone from wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potatoes, shoes that were salted with wood."
It said, as he noted, "837 registered food products authorised in the production of wheat, 511 registered coffee products."
Some stories are of honor and integrity.
An American recognizes his own desire for wildness and says about the war: "I feel that in spite of all of this, what was meant for men was to sit in the living room with the evening sheet or the best seller and a cigarette and a whisky in hand, and to do so as such a fasced civilization and as it does not give a barbaric behind its own strong and determined collapse."
On the other hand, a British soldier recognizes that he may die and that he will not take notice of it or take care of it.
"If you are willing to sacrifice yourself, take a break, you want to think that this is happening before a public," he writes.
Instead, it's as awful as "a convicted man who was held in secret."
Other observations are made by the old Europe, which falls apart, and by new forms of terrorism.
"The conflict has increased into an economic dispute," England writes, "a war between factories."
He begins the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the possession of a young century": "the word used and ideologically convinced mass murder in the measure that kills while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unpretentious manner and there are also liberal behaviours such as heroism.
In England, soldiers who are actively trying to catch up with a prostitute with a sexual disease to get out of front service.
"The great expression of it can be found in trade with Gonocoke-Eiter, because soldiers bought and injured on their genitals, hoping to get into the hospital," he writes.
"Those who were truly in doubt cast him into the eyes of what led them to be blind to the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish of Peter Graves, England's poetry is made smooth and unflagging and perfectly fits its human role.
In thousands of small scenes, he begins the way in which the war "one-timely eliminated uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hass".
People start to wonder why their leaders bring them to war.
The best books about the first world war were most popular like Paul Fussels "Great War and Modern Memory" or Romane like Erich Maria Remarkques "In the West nothing new" as extensive history books.
England's band joins an unconventional silence hall.
His book has the most glorious ending I've ever read in a book.
I'm not giving it here anymore.
But it's like he would have dragged us away with his book with the main people before the nose and burned us with a string of wood.
After an early failure, a minutely planned envelope
Hundreds of police officers were involved, and some of them were employed.
You had decided for the night of Monday on Tuesday, because there are few people in Zucotti Park at this time.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officers were informed. All the others believed at first to participate in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence undermining the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The events of the past few weeks, such as the use of pfeffer spray against Protestants, which violates the rules of the dezernat and has brought huge increases in public sympathies, were no longer necessary.
And so the police action to remove the protestors from the Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared this by observing how legislation was maintained in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a look at Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials have strengthened the so-called Chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, which is also the rapid decline of a large number of police officers - in order to concentrate on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit found Montagnacht on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came "in the last minute", someone who was trusted with the orders said what for a declaration as "execution".
"The few police officers who were involved in my knowledge didn't know it was going to the Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to stay anonymous.
"The only ones who knew that it was about the Zuccotti Park were the high-ranking officials of the resource."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On 14 October, officials wanted to rent the park, but they came back as hundreds of Protestants together after they had learned about these plans.
Officers of various police units were involved in the operation of the day of service, including the use of command from the entire city - hundreds of mobile officers, usually used in high criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people went into and out of the park, almost like Pendler, so that 1 hour in the night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the minimum number of people stood in the park," he said.
Rescue cars with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers stood before the departure of the Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded messages from the speakers appeared to attract many Protestants.
When the public officials entered the park in their bright blue wind jackets, many Protestants simply broke up their affairs and left the place.
The police said that up to 1:45 no cells would be arrested to give protestors time to pack their assets and goods together.
Other teams of officials have seen how they gathered in the environment to get in touch with the arrests in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, the speaker of the police president, said this had happened to their own safety.
But many journalists claimed that they wanted to stop watching the police in the park, and they said that the conduct of the officials was very serious.
Mr. Browne said that television cars could have made photographs in the Church Street on the west side of the park.
When the police moved to the West through the great contrast to personal matters of the Protestants, including cups, plastics and cloths, their officers followed the city training that had been set up.
Some Protestants who refused to go were thrown outside. Pictures of this appeared recently on the Internet later.
A main core of protestors was located near the kitchen area of the warehouse in the center of the park position.
Some established barriers and the police continued their methodic arrests.
About 10 people in the camp's epicenter join their arms.
And two people ran into trees themselves, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency protection officers were called to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until 3:30 p.m.
The room was closed after the police said it was 75 minutes.
Mr Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most arrests came, as he said, due to "indemnity and resistance to a arrest".
The prominent local officer was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department, the highest uniformed officer of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, Chief of Criminal Affairs, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not perform the operation", as Mr. Browne said.
In order to access them, a second group of officials waited on the east side of the Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In the Cortland Street, a street block north of the park, and in the Pine Street, a block further south, Barrikaden was built.
It could be observed how these police stations continued to expand the area around the Zuccotti Park.
In one place many officers were watched, many of them were taken out with protective cameras, people.
About 28 people were located in the north.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5 o'clock, a protester jumped south of Pine Street onto the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air off the edge of a police bus.
In one place, the amount was a piece of sprewolz.
At the end, an officer and a Protestant came into the hospital.
The manager's cooperation will be brought into force because of the discharges of complaints against the city
The trade union, which has lost hundreds of students who lost their job last month, plans to complain about the city on Wednesday, as the discharges are not necessary and discriminatory because of their inadequate influence on schools that teach poor students.
The complaint is probably the last opportunity the Association, District Council 37, is still open in its efforts to reverse the exemptions.
Six hundred and two thousand school assistants, care coordinators and other workers who were among the worst paid employees in the city and had lost their jobs on a shift on 7 October, described the trade union leader as a political party to refuse access to a health fund that the working groups were supposed to have closed up during the past year.
This claim was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Treaty, Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, said last month that the discharges were part of the budget that had been adopted in June.
A member of the City Treaty came back and explained to him that the budget did not specify that the school staff would be released.
Officials of the City Treaty said they had and warned the Ministry of Education before a complaint. On Wednesday, a press conference will be held to announce the submission of the complaint before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The complaint will be filed by Mr. Walcott and the City Education Ministry as accused and count eight retired workers as complainants who are all colourful or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a speaker of the city's Ministry of Justice, said that the city was not in a position to submit the complaint and could therefore not comment on its individual claims.
According to a New York Times complainant, the company has focused on the number of dropouts in the schools in the poor districts of the city to support a complaint for unequal treatment. She claims that poor schools would have lost more help since they were chronically underfunded.
It shows that, while there were no discounts on States Iceland and only a few discounts in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school assistants in the District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 assistants in the Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
With the finding of the loss of five of eight students who were in public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students were living in poverty, the complaint says: "This is not the presence of wealthy parents who can organize funds to get budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was reduced by 3.26 per cent this year. In addition, money was lost when the city changed its method of calculation for the extrafinance for each school subscription.
The company also regrets that the leaders of the High Schools were led by language in a memo in Ireland, which allowed the release of the maintenance coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even though "excess" (German: translate) in the United States usually describes the change of a teacher from a school's salary list into a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were released, not transferred," the complainant said.
Mission finished, Congress ready to understand Libya
Finally, it seems as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington would already understand the situation in Libya.
All that was needed for this was the success of the revolution, the arrest and murder of the long-term dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of the American invasion.
On Thursday, the Senate's International Relations Committee decided a resolution that would support President John Kerry (Massausset) and Senator John McCain (Arisona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the American troops for their "death".
"This resolution honors the courageous Libyan people who have begun rebuilding their country," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but it has not been easy in the Libyan debate before.
This summer legislators dispute both parties and the White House on the choice of a number of resolutions to legitimise or undermine the role of the US military in NATO's Libyan mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution which allowed the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was handed down in the Senate by a broad group of two parties, and it came to no vote.
However, on the same day, this law was passed in the Senate. Furthermore, the Chamber voted a decision to cut the money for American operations in Libya.
This led the US mission to a kind of legislative fire - with a Congress that was held enough to criticize Obama in the course of the mission, but did not anger enough to finally remove him from the ground under his feet.
Then the inconsistency of the Congress was overemphasized by the events.
In August, Tripoli fell under the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission ended officially on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Committee's resolution on international relations "gratulates Libya's human courage and extraordinary endurance in its self-reliance" and "describes the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support the military operations for the protection of people in Libya, for their extraordinary courage and professionality."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy".
Are the new measures fully supported by the Foreign Relations Group, or will they be broken down by lawmakers, as the law of June has done?
The last sentence is based on the opposition of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican of the Committee.
Lugars spoke on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to the chapter, it is at the Senate to agree this week on a constitutional change which requires a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every period of Congressary Congress and some Democrats.
The measures under the direction of the Republican Bob Goodladte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change in the budget or in another area which will come at the time of the vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have tried successfully so far to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have often tried enough.
Good amendment is only one of 68 constitutional amendments submitted to this Congress and includes a whole range of topics.
Some are double - the same law has been submitted to both the Congress and the Senate - others are only slightly different.
There are at least 15 versions of the balance sheet change in the Senate alone and another thousand which would "control federal expenditure".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their contractors - in particular beginners in the Republicans who want to invest their lives - the possibility of predicting that they have "confirmed" such a measure.
The budgetary control legislation adopted in August requires both the Senate and the Congress to vote on a change in the budget balance.
In March 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that may be submitted by the members of the Congress, while the Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wishes to limit the limitation on two official times of the President.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments which guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change which prohibits marriage under equality is as a change which prohibits the burning of prisoners as a constant proposal.
Some legislators would also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if bilaterals of the states refuse to do so.
As required by the Members' proposals, they are moving as quickly as they have been in the past years.
At the 111th Congress, 77 such amendments were proposed by lawmakers at 110th Congress 66.
The time is reduced in comparison with the early 1990s, in which members regularly propose more than 150 amendments every two years, the figures that make the Senate library available.
But they were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but has already been proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Drived but Not Win," said Giffords in the first watch after the interview
Ten months after a armed man had shot her during a election event in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arisona) went up to the national television. She sang alone to the Broadway section "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that she wanted to get herself to go back to the convention.
When she and Diane Sawyer appeared in the ABC news "20/20", she ran for words and needed help to go.
The message showed the severe slow recovery of the damage that the bullet shared, which passed through the left side of her brain and crossed her head from the front to the back.
Three months ago, she returned to the convention to express her voice in triumph.
In her first television interview after the attack in January, where six people were killed and 13 were killed, Gifford laughed and sang - and described her generation as "hard".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41): "Good luck."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronomer Mark Kelly, was part of a unique "20/20" special, which was recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the marriage: "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The Special Follows Gifford's Generation since the attack on 8 January.
In videos that Kelly recorded in the first week, you can see her in the hospital bed, with a neck-red head and a long neck over the stars.
She can only have one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how she performs simple movements.
A knife with the head.
A cup of tea with the lip.
And then their first words are, "What?"
After a few days, Giffords has another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's generation: You can see how the congressmen, together with the therapists, sing to Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wana Have Fun" and to Tom Pettys "Free Fallin".
In interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day with therapy, said she can't remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that on 12 March he had read an article of a daily newspaper about the attack when she interrupted him and asked for the first time after the six people who had been killed during the attack.
The necessary protection Jared Lee Loughner is in a prison in Missouri and is severely treated while waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," said Gifford Sawyer.
" Heart, heart, heart."
During the marriage of his wife, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say, "Gabby, you didn't win?" said Kelly.
You just got hit.
And you'll get through it and you'll get it and you'll get back stronger than ever.
Groups receive more sympathy than respect
The event was a Wall Street Gala that collected millions of dollars for undiscovered veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sings a ballade about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On a stickword, hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines gathered around him.
The amount in black foamings stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the surrender in the spring.
A high-ranking military officer on the Gala, who was observed, among other things by the Chief of Staff and the then president, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced as children of cattle," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers have made a good point.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, really, it was mercy.
The sharp opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most remote, sometimes amazing American public.
The troops are often praised for their sacrifice.
But the lobby has its price, say officials.
The public is growing as they do people in uniform suffering.
"We were not victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, the troops in Iraq will be forced and soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support them is to press us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear undeterred or in conflict with the public they serve.
They also recognized that the forest, which returned troops in the last years of the Vietnam War, was much worse.
As a result, talks about co-operation take place in styles and privacy between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from battle with the Marines, Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a sense of awe as they defeated the rebels and fled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a "extreme, violent veteran was hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and after his return took over a stolen state post in Washington.
In his search for work, he said, he said that some of the respondents asked subtlely whether he was in a position to remain behind the pressure of a demanding post in Washington after his return from the war.
"When you talk about your service, you have to keep the negative impressions against it," Cancian explained his sons.
The lack of flexibility of the military is due to the lack of interest of the Americans in the war.
Services on the battlefield will be taken by a country that has little experience with the military and only few benefits in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, only rarely seen as praise.
"We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroism as much as it was in the second world war," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., the US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses largely on the suffering of a servant.
Groups shall be recognised for the number of attacks they have committed, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
Military puts the growing pressure on hard transitions in violence.
This week, an important hearing will be held on whether 28 women and men are accused of rape in a military court.
If it does not, hundreds of complainants are ready for the next hearing.
Overcrowded Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and was pregnant on the 11th week when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from the evenings with a friend when she met a male colleague who took a 12-pack beer with her.
He asked her if she should accompany her to a drink in her room.
"My alarm clocks went up," said Lyman.
But the Texaner weighed their concerns.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had heard of my feelings."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man went after her, pushed her down and raped her, claimed her.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military representatives are awaiting a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, deciding whether a complaint they have filed against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessors, Donald Rumsfeld will be allowed before the court.
The complaint argues that Gates and Rumsfeld did not oppose the widespread violence within the military and under the violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February of Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., filed the complaint at the beginning of 17 complaints that increased to 28 months: 25 women and three men who all claimed to have been raped or abused by military colleagues, and that the military failed to detect, prosecute, or make an appropriate legal statement after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's following the highest military command, as the problem begins there.
"The military has been hierarchically built," she says.
"Who are the individual people who are in the position to pay the cultural compensation of the one to be paid? The leadership."
Burke also says that she has contacted nearly 400 more survivors since February, many of them may be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: Instead of putting all the complainants in a basket so that they can put their eggs in a box, they will submit many more complaints, if necessary, to receive the press directly.
The defense team for the Ministry of Defence, led by the Federal State Counsel Neil MacBride, has submitted an application for a complaint.
The acts of the Court of Justice, which are held in Newsweek, are closely following the defence strategy, first of all, that the military cannot be accused of current or former soldiers for injuries to which it has come in the combat forces.
Because of a Supreme Court Act of the 1950s, the so-called Feres Doctor, the government did not have to pay for damages that are added to existing soldiers in the active service.
"The possible damage occurred during the military service of the complainants," says the document.
The Ministry of Defence rejects any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are not yet allowed to serve in the struggle, the distinction lies solely in the name: modern wars have only rarely clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in war areas.
The result: 150 soldiers died between these two wars, two thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the military to be modernized, Burke says.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three more complaints, except for her.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic filed a complaint against the four most important military cadmiums due to the need to promote a female hostile atmosphere.
Regardless of this, the community-owned Vietnam Veterans of America raises a complaint against the military, in which one focuses on the diagnosis of "personal disorder", the rape victims received to release them from the service - a common practice called activists such as Anu Bhagati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December her group filed a complaint against the Veterans Administration (i.e. the administration of the war veterans), in which they maintained their discriminatory practices in their treatment with performance requirements for persons engaged in sexual abuse in the service.
Nine laws were submitted independently by a mix of senators and representatives of both parties to the Congress offering a number of starting points.
According to the 2010 Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, 3,158 sexual abuses of the Ministry of Defence were reported.
However, most of the abuses are not reported at all, and according to the own estimates of the Pentagon, this figure takes into account about 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19 000 cases per year.
The report published in March also examined the prosecution rates: 20 per cent of the cases reported in the military before the court, only half as many as in civil law.
The complainants in Burkes case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported to the military police that it was less than an hour after the accident.
On this night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape of a whole range of police officers, doctors and commanding officers.
She had a rape order and the blood of her attacker, who came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked about the sex she had with her friend before the funeral.
Six people said as characters in the name of the forced acter who was finally released.
"I remember very well the day the sentence was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the guilty would be punished. I ran out of court. "
"They brought me into the psychiatric department, and I remember that when I came back, I told my commander, "That wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was asked to search for a military psychiatrist who finally diagnosed a personality disorder and explained it for service.
In January 2010, she was unexpectedly released, so she received no support.
Whether the complaint filed by Lyman and the other complainants is a clear speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes, "They should come before me."
What lies between them and a court case is this doctor who has been criticized since she was first questioned.
I'm currently a critic of the Fairy Doctor.
The military hangs a decade later because they do not own the same move and the same cut-off that brings a debt to themselves.
He adds: "The chances are against her... but it's important for her to try."
These things will only change if good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its path, Burke, the lawyer of the complainants, will begin with her hundreds of other complaints for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard until it comes to reform," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers watch on Facebook
Before he became the new face of legal extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many young people who sent their anti-refoulement opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who was present, had held an ammo in Norway in July, where 77 people were killed, his first public hearing was before the court.
Although Breivik may have worked alone, he is not alone in cyberspace: He has spent a lot of time in front of his computer and estimated with some millions of nationalists who support right-hand groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find it?
This is easy - you only have to log in on Facebook.
"We have determined that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by the British Idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook Hide personal data is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett says that researchers need to simply use the website's advertising tool to determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as the marketer has been doing for years.
Bartletts team found half a million fans of right-wing groups throughout Europe and then visited them with Adds, but instead of associating with a new band or a new diet product, the Adds users were invited to a survey in which they were asked after their education, their attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to ask more than 10,000 supporters of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without having to leave their office once again.
"It's a real new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online providers of right-wing groups are mostly young, male and proud of immigration.
But in a kind of surprise, "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their screens."
DEMO's work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea, medical researchers and politicians use the page to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as "likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users who add three content per day to the average, Facebook generates a research tree that has increased the number of scientific works on the name of this page in the last five years by almost 800%.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study through this page people you don't usually reach on the street with your clipboard.
"If you tried to ask people of the British National Party earlier, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and would never have given them access," says Bartlett.
"On Facebook it's all gone - you're going straight to them."
Others say that the page offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A current study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues has found that students who discussed their full voice on Facebook mean more to drinking than students who move on this subject.
Moreno suggests that equivalent students, such as housing consultants, monitor the page and help a student when they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko-author and leader of the Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle of Washington Post.
"We have found an opportunity to identify endangered children who would not otherwise have been found."
Facebook also keeps tapping the data of its own population.
The page's database has created statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, selection participation in the 2010 options and a national lucky index (both in the first line used only Facebook access - Master of digital freedom has long known that the page should make its large database available for other research purposes.)
However, Facebook users know that the page monitors them whether they want it now or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is away from miles, you will be allowed to print your own personal data on the page.
But what if the users of Facebook become part of a survey they don't even know anything about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data online, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think that many users have ever considered the fact that a researcher could study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study in which he examined the public page of students on Facebook.
"As far as she's concerned, it's only about her and her friends."
Then there is still the question of the methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a researcher is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the data are true in a user profile and in contributions.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Thus, despite his age, Selwyn believes as a technology researcher that a clipboard and a stift are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out in the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research needs to take care of the social environment - and every amount of social life is still on the line."
"Chalt and inhuman": Other Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Another Behring Breivik, the man who had two amokmen killed in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Norwegian templer," he said before a court hearing with more than 500 people.
"I appeal against the court because you have received your mandate from organizations to support hasidiology and because it is supported by multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I don't blame myself."
Justice Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, as "Breivik did not want to give the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to use Breivik, who made a written statement earlier, to appeal to his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also arranged that the police kept Brevik in custody for 12 more weeks, he had no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities would check all visits and the total correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and members of the victim participated in the hearing.
Some came in the hope to see Breivik in the eyes, others wanted to confirm that he remained behind lock and ring.
Everyone shared the goal that everything should be on an exit.
"I thought he was cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian messenger NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it's going to be a bit further after I saw and heard the suspects."
Breivik took a dark approach and a blue tie and acted quietly and professionally during the entire hearing. He watched journalists and survivors in the eyes as he spent the building and left it again.
Despite Breivik's odd hint, he would be part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had complications.
It may have happened to some that the attacks of July 22 appeared to be the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the confusion and confusion that still haunts a whole nation?
"I wanted him to look like a monster, but he didn't do it," said the victim's staff.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 Lessons of the interview with the deceased Steve Jobs that was shown this week in a theatre
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford and took the technique as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple-Fans may have found in the most recent job interview, which was created this week before special film performances on the major markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and work processes.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and himself called hippie, but he was also an acribian organizer, who insisted on diagrams - a man who believed that many business leaders suffer from "a disorder of thought," "that a really great idea makes 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of craft between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Fachidiotes" about the appearance of the computer. He spent more than an hour with jobs, in which they conducted one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, more than 10 years had passed since Apple was forced out of jobs. He was already working hard on his new company NeXT, and he was happy for the wide acceptance of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in fachidiotes, he says that the copies of the interview were missing during delivery.
Only after Jobs Death, a complete VHS copy was discovered in the Director's garage.
This easily revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes into the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who knows that he has accepted extensive interviews, jobs here seem surprising in the explanation of his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And incredible.
During the interview, there are four times too long breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds later, in which jobs clearly reflect their thoughts and strive to be accurate.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism comes at day, when it seems impatiently to respond to Cringelys questions and tends to get him into more important issues or issues.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the lost interview seems somehow mysterious when it evaluates jobs what other companies think are right or wrong and their own vision of the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read posthume claims of career Jobs. But Jobs here as the desired dreamer, who is on the spring to greatness, is something completely different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things might be and should be.
Soon after he had done all this here, he went out and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
As he learned to run a company:
"For all the years in the business, I always ask, "Why do you do things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's done."
No one knows why he does what he does, no one really thinks about things.
That's what I figured.
Jobs continue his efforts to rationalise the accounting with Apple.
Remarked as costs were recorded - most of them started with "standard costs", which were applied to mere confusion and then adjusted with "distribution" - he developed an automated factory, which ensured that business costs could be determined to the minimum.
How the Pope was charged:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which you could connect to the telephone company and conduct remote chats.
The device has already been written a lot, but Job's enthusiasm when it describes the Blue Box as an act of self-authorization is impressive.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a charging phone, act on a call and then connect to another AT&T network while passing as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things a half a thousand times around the globe, and when you rolled into the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone," says Jobs.
"We were young and we learned that we could build something that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
We both didn't know much, but we were able to build this little thing that could control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think it would be without them Apple.
Jobs continues to tell about a glorious string, the Wozniak and he had drawn near when they called in the middle of the night via Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the pope, while they were so well able to follow Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two had to leave before the pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with the technique (and unpretentious Bill Hewlett called):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for replacement parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone, work for the summer received part-time job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable effect on me. It was the only company I had seen in my old age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, the job of one of the HP employees who visited the company's research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever built".
He was as big as a boxer, had a small screen with brown röhre, and I loved him.
I would use HP as a teenager to climb up and rely on this machine and write programs for her.
How to improve innovation:
Many times in the interview, Jobs are talking about how to find new products spontaneously.
Already early in his career, when he built some platinums, he was asked by a client to compile the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think about the composition and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later on Apple, he recalls the problems he had with developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the following arguments... you swore to me that it would last five years [to build a wall that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Nineteen days later we had a mouse that we could build for $15. That was incredible.
Over large companies that remain:
Long before he relived Apple, Jobs saw the ways in which so many industrialists gathered with their vision in columns and lost control of their shares.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so do you make a better copyer or printer, then?"
They own the share monopol, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [i.e. such people], which eventually lead the companies and the product that people are forced to find.
The product genius, which has led to this monopolisation, is driven by people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products - hand art is necessary.
It happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger, could have been the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They have cleared the landings of the victory.
About Innovation as an art form:
"There is every amount of craft between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You're learning a lot about his qualities.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to note 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them together...
Finally, it goes beyond the taste, it goes beyond trying to combine these things with the best testimony that humans have created, sets them apart, and then tries to bring them together to what you are doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists clasp.
We're always pretty good at making great ideas.
Part of what Macintosh did was that the people who worked there were musicians, artists, artists, zoologists, historians, the best computer scientists in the world.
Had it not been the computer industry, they would have created fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dance against health laws, as the case may be taken by the court
On the day when the Supreme Court closed behind the doors to discuss the political question of whether a hearing of President Obama's health law will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner that was commissioned by the Chancellor to present the case before the court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the requests for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a complaint that 26 countries have filed against the broad reform of health, which was decided by the Congress last year, a law that was violated by conservatives everywhere in the United States.
The judges agreed to listen. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion will be expected in March, which will probably lead to the 2012 presidential debate, which will be fully in place at the time when the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who stands before the court and is accused of breaking the law will probably be Paul Clement, the first public prosecutor under the government of George W. Bush.
Clements Kanzlei, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two thousand companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, an old-age group dedicated to the defence of conservative legal principles.
Another company, which represents the Diner sponsor, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which enforces the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical agent Pfizer Inc., who is deeply involved in the results of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had consulted the case, in a Washington hotel.
The service included Mitch McConnell, the head of the Republicans' Group in the Senate and a clear opponent of the health reform
The guest of the dinner?
This is nothing new: the two judges have been visiting events of the Federalist Society for years.
And that doesn't violate moral rules.
In fact, the judge is exempt from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they do, they may fall under principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may take part in legal proceedings closer to and other organizations, where the judge cannot be a speaker, honorary or programmed to be a guest of such an event."
On the other hand, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the Chancellors involved in the case and to a company with a massive financial interest in this to alert moral and government activists.
"This exhilarating breach with moral and the contrary to the Code condemns the complaints of a judge who was lying, the court held the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil law movement in the United States.
"The judges won and graduated during a fine-winning event with lawyers with fluid procedures at the court."
Their presence and their support for a grant agreement for this event undermines any claim for impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little attention to critics who say that they would easily mix judicial matters with groups that can lead to the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife Gini is a well-known conservative activist.
On the contrary, the conservatives claimed that it was Judge Elena Kagan who had a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general state lawyer under the Obama government when the first legal proceedings were brought before the Court.
Their critics forced Kagan to withdraw himself from hearing the case because of prejudice because they were too involved in the defence of the law in order to be uncompromising.
Kagan doesn't do anything to do this.
Boeing gives a record mission of 18 billion dollars to land
Emirate Airport has 50 dual aircraft from the Boeing 777 type with an option of 20 more aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 billion.
It is really a rare message that a company receives a order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big deal when the company of the air carrier Boeing Co. is and the list price for these 50 aircraft is totaled at a record sum of 18 billion dollars.
Also unusual is the driver of Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future flight orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East need $450 billion in the next 20 years 2.520 aircraft.
Boeing announced his biggest appointment on the weekend for commercial aircraft, measured at the value of the order: 50 double Boeing 777 Jets.
The Hammer airport came from Emirates from Dubai.
In addition, Boeing announced it in 2011 on the Dubai Airport, an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which will raise the total list price to $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improved the gas consumption and the comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 billion.
"It's absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, a Börsenfachmann of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by oil-producing countries.
So they don't only have the money to pay the aircraft. More is an increase in the prices of oil that normally harm airlines because this is one of their largest cost points, not so damaging as the country deserves a higher price.
This is important because they tend less than other airlines to break down or transfer aircraft orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have a natural insurance," he said.
The order of Emirates confirms Boeings' leadership position on the market for large-scale aircraft and helps keep the Airbus competitor SAS in stock, which attacks the A350 authority.
Boings victory on the air traffic boat comes four months after Airbus announced, but the introduction of the largest A350, which is directly competitive with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was made to gain more confidence after the customers had asked for a higher benefit and wealth.
Boeing shares rise by 1.5% to $67,94.
Mexican President's sister apparently lost election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon argues that drug dealers have supported Fausto Vallejo from the PRI in the run for government posts.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon appears to have lost her application for the office of Governor Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed that on Monday, drug dealers had affected the race for the benefit of one of their opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo has won the run for the government posts in the western state by the institutional party of the revolution, the PRI.
"The introduction of organised crime during the entire election process and especially on the cold day is alarming, not just for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... they hired electoral cabinets, built street blocks ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled for seven decades in Mexico until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But they strive for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just hit a few times that led to the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the conservative Partido Akcción National PAN of her brother, refused to acknowledge Vallejo as a winner.
Silvana Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolution Party PRD, who is currently a former ruling governor, came to the site of Trie, a heavy lower position for the split and unhappy left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, lies links to drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has been controlled for a long time by drug cartels specializing in Marihuana, heroin and amphetamine.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
Violence is still going on.
A PAN mayor was murdered a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and many candidates were afraid of the local elections.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, regardless of how radically the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the run for the presidency is Enrique Pena Nieto, the Vallejo from Washington, and said, "I think this victory will leave us looking forward to next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the euro area
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the euro area in its serious debt crisis to prevent a long-term decline that will slow the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, director of the ADB with headquarters in Manila, said that both of the world's fastest growing economic nations must "all in your power" do to accelerate the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or by direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), who looked at the difficulties in Europe, and said that financial support for European leadership and European resources through Asia would help prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We all sit in the same boat."
"So is everyone helpful who can help Europe out of this crisis," he said to the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected up to a certain degree, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then with all the means."
In the past months, the European currency union has been in a serious debt crisis.
In the past days, Italy's interest costs are high and the Prime Minister has returned from both Italy and Greece.
The emerging serious debt crisis in Europe is causing anxiety that the global economy could run into the recession and led to calls for the leading countries to come together to support the euro area.
Mr Nag said that any support for Asia would be channelled by the IWF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of EU rescue funds, the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) - would offer European partners in Asia greater negotiating power.
And Sharma, the Indian Minister for Trade, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the euro area, as its own economy now leads to the decline in exports and foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We are facing great challenges and we need to have a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's a job, because elsewhere we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies, such as India, are not allowed to help rich Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at the U.S. Brown University, said it would be politically difficult to sell the 1.2 billion people in India help for Europe, of which more than $800 million or less live the day.
"At the same time, they will find out that the Greeks go in interest with 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then there is a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Director of the World Economy Forum, asked similarly why India's reserves should be used to keep the many and well-paid employees in public service in Greece, with jobs that are bad-leaded, loss-making facilities such as the railways.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the eurozone would have "significant domino effect" throughout Asia.
The forecast of ADB with an economic growth of 7.5 per cent in Asia for the year 2011 is now "the risk of extinction" due to the rising risk of Europe.
He said that harmful slave markets had to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves for a detachment and a significant increase in their economies.
Urgent warnings from the pentagon before possible cuts in the protective tissue
Minister of Defence Leon Panetta called on the Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would not notice national security. Thus, he resolved a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the outbreaks of war in Afghanistan and civil refugees.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts of $450 billion in the coming decade, but it is now afraid that further cuts will be needed at $600 billion or more if the convention cannot reach a conclusion in expenditure.
"The effects of these cuts would be honoured for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of the Congress to reach a budget agreement leading to a so-called resolution would lead to 23% of general cuts and a stop of many new projects.
"With such a high cut, carried out in such an unexpected way, most of our ship and construction projects would make it impossible - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernization efforts would seriously harm the senators," Panetta wrote.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves voluntarily from a large part of our civilian staff and, as the reduction would be applied so quickly, we would have to allow civilians to achieve the goal with the certainty of the cross-border probability."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who receive our military directly and seriously damage our alertness."
The cuts finally met the fighting troops," Panetta said.
"While wartime quotas are not directly affected by the action, the difficult approach to the basic budget would have a significant impact on war efforts," Panetta warned.
"Personal settings have been cut short, leading to delays in the settings and monitoring of the settings that support the war."
"The holder of staff would be cut off, which would lead to late payments to wartimers and the legal and political support would be broken."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and requested further details regarding the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of a decision by the Ministry of Defence would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as the leading military force of the world."
"We are very much against this dramatic action," said the senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panettas letter.
"This is a result we can't live with, and there's certainly no one to force us."
"The decision is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and its entry into force should not be allowed."
Whether the Panettas letter and the new warnings of senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or the demands to take out the Friday of cuts remain to be expected.
Panetta has increasingly voiced the possible cuts, although he was able to collect many years of experience with the budget in the Congress and in the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knew that he was faced with difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence took a sad picture of what might happen - a soldier with a sword, but without a core.
"It's a ship without matrosene."
"It's a Brigade without munition."
"It's an air defence guard without a sufficient charge of pilots."
"It's a paperman, an army of castles, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers who are able to complete the mission," Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
"It is a struggle which is lacking in moral and alertness and which is not able to take it with potential enemies."
"She's really going to be angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta introduced new details on how "significant operational risks create: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global capacity for use and intervention, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects of the strike could happen to the victim, including those already tested and already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the fighter F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic U-boats, the new Littoral Battle Ship and the new underground fighter vehicle, the army and Marine need to replace the Humvee.
If it were to stop further development and testing of the F35, this would save up to $80 million in the next 10 years, but the sponsors would say that it is a more important step towards refurbishing, so that possible risks could be identified by China and other opponents.
How to Avoid a Lie
A look at the current defeat lines shows how suspicious and widespread confusion and lies are in daily life.
The presidential candidate of the Republican Herman Cain is working to make the accusations of sexual abuse on the part of several women. Both sides are involved in lying.
The leadership of Penn State is accused of my age because it is likely that reports have been kept, after which a retired football train boy has been sexually abused.
Last week an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy accused American President Barack Obama of claiming that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
False corrupt careers and corrupt countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet exhibitor Anthony Weidner became a narcissist when he engaged in slanders, which were quickly rejected by unconstitutional evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is charged with the failure to finance the campaign, which is linked to the replacement of an extraordinary deal.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it has forgotten the media circus that President Bill Clinton has solved when he has lied to Monica Lewisky about his sexual relationship with the Oval Office during his second term of office.
Stories about noises in school and college exams are widely distributed.
There were occasions when teachers gave their students the exams so that they could have good access to their performance tests themselves.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and dreams are okay.
How much confusion do we experience?
As studies show, we lie every day between 10 and 200 times.
Many of these lies, however, apply to us as legends.
Another study shows that foreigners are absent three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing lies or "discovering lies" is one that is important for every person, and this is for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game, such as a drawback, where the goal is to call you!, it is to draw up a series of sciences based on scientific data collected at selected universities over the past six decades, which carried out extensive research projects, in particular in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most old myths have been removed from the lie.
They're lying to one in the eyes.
They stop, they stop, they grow up and they don't always jump.
However, we must not conclude that these lies are difficult to detect and eliminate.
An experienced doctor can convey the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expression, the question and timing.
I've spent several years studying the scientific results of the comprehensive and constantly growing range of isolation. And it is clear that the introduction of a divergence is a modern capacity that is easy to learn and helps us in accessing our complex world, especially if the establishment or question of persons or negotiations or administration is part of our own professional responsibilities.
Good lies are very good in estimating other people to awaken their interest and control their own emotions, and they smell intuition as they are taken from others.
We know from research that extroverted people often lie more often than introverted people, that men often say "self-introverted" lies than women whose lies are more "orientate to others" - in fact they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people are less often accused of their partners than unwed people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fatty lies").
We also know that when a person is removed as a victim, others feel less guilty of having joined him.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First of all, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
That's called Baseling, the exit position.
It provides a reference point for later evaluation of changes.
Watch the attitude, the tongue, the voice quality of their test person.
They should know better when a person normally gets used to his feet, so that they don't blame him for injustice when he's dating his feet.
Then focus on seizures more casually and nonverbal behavior.
Do not view these attachments as alarm clocks that shout, as evidence of a delay.
People who mourn may die if they try to remember their history. Maybe they show their feet in the direction of the door or they turn towards the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "response after the settings conversation", this deep, relaxing look and the change in attitude when all hard questions are over.
Questionnaires often signal falsely that an configuration dialogue is overdue just to keep an overview after this delay.
In addition, consider the language of your test person.
Scott Peterson's exodus is famous when he used the form of the past, when he claimed, his murdered wife was still alive and a national search for her.
Delicate people can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Vivinsky" or if you repeated a serious question in general.
The most common white marks are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a queer question: "Now... to tell you the truth ... as long as I know ... as well as I know."
This will make the answer more effective than the fact that the alarm clocks often shout.
There are no magic tools to get rid of lies, but you can learn skills thanks to which reconciliation is possible.
Thanks to these abilities, everyone can rarely be the victim of offenders, both in private and in professional life.
Arbitrary plan of an oil pipeline is revised after threat by delayed US approval
A few days after Obama's government threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada into the Gulf of Mexico, where the trade unions were delayed and while protecting the environment, this is what the pipeline is trying to re-plan the project so that you can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be transferred from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Parliament building of Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the company is still confident that the pipeline will be finally approved, even with another route.
This was followed by an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision on a federal solution to the project would be rejected until the new possible transition was checked, which included the Sandilla area in Nebraska and the Ogalla-Aquifer, a large water supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, against Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may postpone a decision by 2013, following the elections in the coming year, even if officials have lied that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama stated in a written statement last week that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and said his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected to Canada with the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrel oil per day from Alberta Province to the refineries in Texas.
To do this, the Pipeline had to cross six countries.
They hate environmentalists, but they love labour markets because they appreciate that the Pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
However, the lawmakers of Nebraska, who are against the plan, weaken the laws to force a withdrawal from the Sandillas region and the Ogalla aquifer, a main source of drinking water and water.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of the Foreign Affairs has found that the project had little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry said that the main auditor of the Ministry called for a separate sin of the review procedure, which focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist, founded by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was the 2008 counselor of Hillary Clinton, was involved in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company assigned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle complains that she may be forced by fear to sin
A New York family claimed that the disco-Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building had received a search case that would have put her little daughter in such fear that she had surrendered in fear.
The Tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer, 18 months old Genevieve Monk, was so afraid that she was suffering from "personal changes, sleep loss" and "higher fear of strangers", said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was last November 10th when ex-employer Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, wanted a babysitter, and Genevieve wanted a family trip.
While Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk went with the bag and Genevieve on the arm to the lobby in her building at Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said that she had stayed near the door and stopped her daughter for a moment.
"Someone looked behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to get her back on the arm," she said.
LaBelle advised the pregnant woman to be angry.
"They said in an aggressive tone: "You shouldn't have your daughter at the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I told you, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became angry and started to spit - she used the F word and the A word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to tap water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you did with my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle insisted on the mother who still took Geneva on the arm and had to stay with her companion and be taken to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby cried so much that it had to pass, she said.
Later the LaBelle family asked in writing for an apology, but received no answer.
LaBelles lawyer and representative did not respond to calls for an opinion.
The complaint is based on a rather specific set of damages, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he does not take into account the honour and the family plan, the money they get, the child's help.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take over responsibility for her behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it comes to the day when a child nurse wears an 18-month-old baby on her arm."
Climate change is at the heart of the economy
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is in government, unemployment and black labour increased in Sinaloa, while foreign investments returned and the economy increased.
In 2011 Sinaloa's economic history will remain in mind. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who himself became the founder of the change and has expressed great hopes for economic growth, is in the government. However, because of climate change, growth cannot be the talk of growth, but the most important economic indicators have failed.
The low temperatures in February resulted not only in loss of millions in agriculture, but also in the growth of the state economy, and in the first quarter, a general decline in economic activity caused by 3.6 per cent of this is mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development by 31.16 per cent, which has had a dramatic impact on other sectors of the economy.
According to a report published by the Mexican Council para el Desarrollo Rural Sustainable (e.g. the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development), 582,000 hectares of agricultural land used have been damaged, of which 78.03 percent have been completely destroyed and the rest 21.07 percent have been damaged.
In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28 per cent and from July to September to 6,19 per cent, resulting in 74 000 unemployment in Sinaloa, was higher than in the first quarter.
Low liquidity
The unemployment rate in Sinaloa last year goes back to a number of factors. The economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the University of Autónoma University of Economic and Social Sciences (UAS), comments that public institutions' policies are indirect in explaining the increasing unemployment.
"What we have observed today is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, with liquidity losses on the market due to the cuts in the media by legislation adopted to combat money laundering at the Congress, because it is not easy for those who purchase the prohibited dollar to work for themselves, invest them or use something else," he explained.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that increasing unemployment also has a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has gone back. This is on the one hand to return to the problem of entry and on the other, because it is also difficult to find work. These people stay here and look for work that increases unemployment," he says.
Black Work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more difficult when it takes into account the high proportion of black labour. This includes, according to INEGI 60.38 per cent of the employed in the country who work without paying in the social insurance case.
Unemployment and black employment are the lowest wages in all Mexico, according to the statistics of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (Mexico Social Insurance) and the Secretariat of Labourjo y Prevision Social (Governmental Authority for Labour and Social Services in Mexico).
The average monthly income of the workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos by September; this is much less than the total average of 7375 pesos.
ADI decline
In addition to the development of economic activity and increasing unemployment in 2011, the strongest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) has been reported for the last ten years. According to the Secretariat of the Economy (State Economic Authority), the ADI was US$ 630,597, which is a figure of 87.74 per cent compared to $5,143,312 in the same period in the previous year.
The Secretariat of the Desarrollo Economico del Gobierno (Governmental Authority for Economic Development), on the other hand, lists a total investment of 17,280,000 pesos in 2011, which consists primarily of enterprises from the tertiary sector.
The Debt
In view of the economic crisis, the Government of the country at the National Congress in July requested a loan of 3,000,000 pesos to be invested in the 18 communities to reactivise the economy in infrastructure projects.
Reactions
The first year of government, Mario López Valdés, was clearly capable of government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the Cámara National de la Industria de la Transformación (National Chamber of Commerce in Mexico) explained that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the Government of Mexico.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really good in this year. It must be worked hard to rebuild the land lost in this year and we must work twice for 2012. The efforts of all and, in particular, the progress of the already well-coordinated government team have not been sufficiently agreed with each other," he explained.
Long-term economic development
Loredo López pointed out that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the country's economic development difficult and slow.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the cold. One of the most important effects is a slow economy that is not moving enough to generate a dynamic economy that could create an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will close the year far below our expectations," he said.
Define New Receipt
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexican Business Verband) in Sinaloa, said that the State should be allowed to operate dynamically.
"In general, we have observed that it has been worked. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to reassess the country's economic profession and line, because it is important to activate all material and human resources Sinaloas," he said.
There's a lot to do
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a vision for the future that links government efforts in better ways.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has advanced, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power has made progress with the government.
"There are areas in which one can say that the government has dealt more extensively. What I can say is that it has been worked and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Constipation for 8 kg Marihuana
At five years of imprisonment and 100 days, a population of Navolato was sentenced to eight kilos of marijuana.
The State administration of the Republic announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a public health offence - here the possession of Marihuana for sale.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican military in the monitoring of the Cipriano Valdez street against guard No 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was in a white delivery car in which he kept a black hole in a box in the car and a small trunk in the trailer seat where the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of Marihuana.
For this reason, the contested goods were handed over to the judge of the district, and the penalty continues to be in the plenary.
Debts for construction
The social buildings of the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes are at risk for migrants because of lack of funds or simply with great delay, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Mayor of the City Authority for Social Development stated that, although the construction programmes have already progressed, they are now in danger because the government has not paid the funds it has allocated for the three programmes of 11 million peso.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes involved almost 50 million peso, 25 per cent of which fell to the state. Until now only the Federación and the community had contributed to the construction of funds, so that it would be expected to delay the construction process.
"12 million must be burned, and even though the year is to end, they have not given us a penny, and that, although they had to pay us a part in July," he said. "To be not late, we have started with the construction work, and they are already making progress, but we need the money."
He stressed that under the government of Jesus Aguilar Padilla the State had failed to comply with its obligations, why the Community had to receive a loan of 7 million at the beginning of its government's time.
"We had already done so in the last legislator period, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to create the funds that the State had not taken to participate in," he said.
Even if the government authorities were obliged to pay this amount, he commented that the Minister for Administrative and Financial Affairs was asked to speed up administrative work and to pay the outstanding part as quickly as possible.
"At least 12 million will have to be burned, and even though the year is to end, they have not given us a penny."
The Court approves the transfer to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of analogues to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) has shown the constitutional complaints filed by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the Presidiumary Order and has the power to submit the transfer of analogues to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes necessary for legal enforcement.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, was the view that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the legislative decree with the details of the movement on the terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute of the Senate in life because it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes in order to enable the court to decide whether the Constitution or non-constitutionality.
The draft complaint drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero was proposed to clarify the bill of law for constitutional reasons, since the Commission is responsible for radio and television regulations, the Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico (Federal Commission for Mexico) would therefore conflict with the principles and provisions of the legislation.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Law Decree. Following the adoption of the complaint, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer referred to the Decree and submitted all activities to establish the digital transmission.
The Council also called on the House of Commons to submit the complaint without including the debate on the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister did not agree with the arguments of the project, and in the sense that the Government cannot regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration by general rules.
"I also do not believe that if you do so, the independence of the regulatory body would affect it," she also reminded us that for the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, the central government is responsible for constitutional reasons, because this leads to state affairs.
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years around the world, and it affects better use of the radio spectrum, high quality of the signal and more channels.
The translation, she said, is an increase in the use of digitisation, which is a decision in the public interest which has not only technical aspects, "because it covers economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "make the whole system's business necessary, in accordance with the principle of economic governance by the State, they included a group of features which lay down the Constitution in the hands of the central government."
It recalled that many countries around the world had already carried out digital translation, although they had high-level specialized agencies.
It is impossible to conclude that the Government, by issuing the decree adopted, would be subject to the competences of the Congress, because the laws adopted by the legislation would comply with it," she said.
The possibility of listing the votes in Michoacán will be considered
According to the PREP, the difference between the first and second places in the election of the Governor is almost 27 per cent, with 879 votes totaled in 6074.
The possibility of individual counting of the vote list is a reality in the elections in Michoacán this year, as according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultos Electorales Preliminaries (PREP), the difference between the first and second places in the election of Governors is almost 27 per cent, with 879 votes of total 6074 not yet counted.
In this regard, the President of the Council of General del Instituto Elektoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ánges Landeral Zaragoza, recalled that just last November, the election place had adopted a number of regulations to harmonise local regulations with federal reforms in elections.
It would be recalled that neither his political constitution nor his election law nor his law on electoral reform were adapted to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they were not in force at this round of elections. Governor Lionel Godoy Rangel refused to publish their publication in the state witness within the time limit set for this argument, and to have no objection.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional complaint filed by the local legislation and considered the vote of the State official on the constitutional reforms as "illegal and illegal", since it did not have the right to "decision or to impose a Veto against it".
María de los Ánges Landeral explained in an interview on the possibility of individual counting of votes that thanks to the adoption of the directives by the General Council of the IEM, it is now possible that the local electoral authority may select the voting list in part or in full.
The results of the protocols may not be consistent under the following conditions, in part, with the votes contained in one or more electoral packages; the Protocol on the number and calculation of votes is not an actuarial or is not in possession of the Chairman of the Committee of Elections or there are obvious errors or changes in the protocols.
In addition, if there is a difference between the necessarily winner and the one who is at second place, which is equal to or less than a percentage, the total exchange of the fully-fledged election may be expected to take place at the beginning of the meeting, an express request from the party or coalition president, who is the second of those candidates.
The voting calculation may also be carried out in its entirety when it is determined at the end of the correct calculation that the difference between the required winner and the candidate on the second place is equal or less than a percentage, provided that an explicit application is made by a representative of the party to which the candidate has become second. In this case, the election packages which have been issued in part would be excluded.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second places is almost 0.16 per cent, although the votes of 129 of all 923 have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ass is spread across the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirms.
The rest of the pilots, Felipe Bacio Cortés, wore this sundial on Saltillo, his place of birth, below. On Monday, the death scene and a deathmatch took place.
According to family members, the last will of the General was that his ass would be spread over the Zapalinamé mountain.
After an honor, the family of Bacio Cortés, together with the others, returned to the capital city of Coahuila in a plane of Mexican aircraft to live in the event of the accident, attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
About twelve o'clock in the afternoon, the seat of the Chief of Staff landed on the castle at Boulevard Nazirio Ortiz Garza, where family members and friends came.
About 17.30 hours, his remains were examined at the technical institute of Saltillo. This physical appearance was performed by his former students from the technical Abitur and his American football team, the Felipe Bacio during his preparation of the Abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ass would be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains. He had always told his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, a pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the Superintendent had fulfilled all his dreams and she thought that he had been in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, especially as a father and son, a loving brother and he was always a member of his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the place Saltillo very young to join Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't take it because they thought it would even take him fast on a truck. Nevertheless, he always tried to make his dream come true.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good person. "He had hardly come to Saltillo, and already wanted to welcome him, as when he took Martha Sahacún to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that he was even at seven years of age after Zapopán was in danger of rating his family members. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what he felt best: flying a plane.
A Last Distinction
The chief officer of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was appointed under the direction of Governor Jorge Torres López with all honor. His honour was given to the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, the schoolmen and students of the technical education agency of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 as well as in the study and sport.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when he was arrested by the hijacker, in which the State Secretary José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons from the same authority were arrested.
About 18.05, the sealed remnants of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, met to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force in front of the barracks by Major Jaime Martinez. He was already expected by his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, sister and other relatives, students and teachers.

Training of the new Italian Government on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present to him the new government that the crisis has led Italy to the edge of the economic collapse.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present to him the new government that the crisis has led Italy to the edge of the economic collapse.
A message from the Presidential Palace announced that the designated Monti would meet with the president of the state, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm government education.
It will be concluded that he will be represented by a majority of the bureaucracy composed of technocrats, although it is still not clear when the new Prime Minister is represented by his office.
Monti said he would present the results of the talks with the political parties on government training.
"I would like to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to complete with these difficult times," the former EU Commissioner told the journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of the government, but his comments indicate that the obstacles are overcome.
The "frame is now well closed," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. However, Italy is struggling with a political and financial crisis that has brought the costs of debt to an unprecedented level.
The new government led by former EU Commissioner Monti has to adopt a strong savings package called for by the European politicians to regain confidence in Italy.
The pressure on the oil that was loaded on Monti was even strengthened by the changing market situation, resulting in the Italian State loans being charged with 7% interest for 10 years. This is in line with the position that Greece and Ireland felt compelled to apply for the European rescue screen.
Emma Marcagglia, president of the Italian Industry Association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government by all means."
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this emergency.
The success of Montis was significantly increased with the support of the PDL party by Silvio Berlusconi, who had to return on Saturday due to the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are determined to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Central Right Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest part of Italy, is essential because so far many of its members have spoken against a majority of existing governments, which form Monti.
Parliament's support
The new Government of Monti needs strong parliamentary support for the implementation of the most likely unfavourable savings measures.
Opposition to its efforts or the slowdown in the reforms could again result in a growing attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks operates with its indication that a failed Montis would be a disaster, as well as pressure.
Monti started his debate on Monday with political parties, trade unions and entrepreneurs, as well as with youth and women's organisations.
Whether to close the end of the session.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who, in response to the crisis, has put in place an extremely rapid change in government.
After a short notice of the end of the last week, when it was announced that Berlusconi would return, the new Prime Minister's success in achieving the costs of Italian State loans has again reached critical limits.
An Italian rescue with a state debt of EUR 1.8 billion would be too much for the current EU rescue screen.
Monti said that his government should continue to postpone the elections until the next elections expected to be held in 2013, despite the assumption that the politicians would only be given time to implement the reforms.
Monti said he would like to take politicians into his office, but the great parties are saying that this should only be made up of technicians, a reference to their concerns in view of the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources indicate that the mutual missteps and differences between the parties make the involvement of people from political life complicated.
Spain has more toys than the Ticos
Of the 22 players from Spain, ten have more than 50 international games on the Buckel.
From Costa Rica, there is only one of the 22 games to play behind.
A huge difference for Costa Rica, when 22 players from both countries are compared to each other for the game of friendship, which takes place today at 15.05 a.m. at San José National Stadium.
While the World and Europe Master, the number one on the FIFA's monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of Class A election games, the three-coloured men have only over the defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
This number was reached on the last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in Rome Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the League de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential Premier League Clubs of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup Championships) as well as high European Cups, such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish Fury in complex decision-making games at the Eurocup and the Football World Championships comes.
The Tico footballers, however, have few international encounters within the Concaaf, which is located on the FIFA range list.
We'll see how the Spanish men get their last register: The Iker Casillas Torvart, who achieved a level equivalent to the former Tornado Andoni Zubizarreta on the last Saturday against England (Netherlands 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign players.
Casillas today will play against the three-colored men and Spain will have a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona Football Club, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received a recognition from the UEFA last week, along with others from the Iberian men who had achieved the magical number 100: the cited Zubizarreta with 126 and the medium drummer of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of hundreds also approaches Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He was followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos with 81, Andrés Inista with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the side of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side tower Junior Díaz with 48 games and the stormer Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there only five on more than 30 games came: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least of the games.
Less than 30 games are shown in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the sides of the National Union are less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even approach the 20th limit.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, named Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Olman Vargas and Eder Nelson have not yet had their debut.
The historic Torrüter Spanish is David Villa with 50 matches followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz shot nine of the most towers, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Quintett took Costa Rica in his tour to celebrate his twenty-year-old existence
"In Costa Rica to play is a dream that is realized"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam says the band is ready to give the next Sunday at the national stadium one of its best concerts.
For more than 20 years, they were expected, but the band was assured that a dream would come true for them when they played in Costa Rica.
The bassist and co-founders of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva the last week of Brazil from an exclusive interview.
The band is in the South American part of its tournament for the celebration of its twenty-year-old existence and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will meet at 19.30 a.m. at the National Stadium with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
They read an extract from the speech to find its complete copy in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans a dream happens when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Do you know what that means for your fans?
To play in Costa Rica is a dream that also works for us.
This is just the second time that we play in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I've only been to the holiday in Costa Rica. It's such a beautiful country that we're determined to stay there for a few days.
It's exciting for us to bring our music back there.
I'm asking you because the fans of the band are fully experienced. They experience the days before the concert.
What do you say to your favorite fans?
Thank you, all these years to be on our side.
We were almost 21 years old until we arrived in Costa Rica. Thanks for waiting so long and it makes us sorry, it took so long until we arrived here.
Some people are even thinking that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've held in the last 21 years took place in the last two weeks.
We have played a couple of Riesenshows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they have made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we have fun to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are excited by the jungle. Costa Rica belongs to the best countries in the world.
How did she know Costa Rica and her waves about the surf?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unpredictable.
My friends have always traveled to the Surf to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico are the excellent areas for the Surf. In this way, we have learned about people who love the Surfs.
With a look at the tour, she has offered her Riesenshows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there, we don't have any limits either.
We will try to give the best show with many different songs. We want to play some songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that's part of it because we have nine plates and can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so the decision we're going to play is not easy.
If we are two or three songs that we have no longer played in the repertoire, we can better keep our concentration straight and they surprise us because they call us the reasons why we fell these songs. Otherwise they could say in ignorance.
That makes the show more interesting for us and I believe, so also for the public.
With this tour, you celebrate your twenty-year-old story.
If you turn back, it is hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, total.
First of all, I believe that none of us have ever imagined to play in a great rock band, and that's over 20 years. It's like a dream.
We also put on these blessings and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like it and are eager to produce music.
We are happy to be able to travel to the places of the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to be actively involved at the time of birth?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of great bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and quite unusual when a movement from a group of friends is made.
Here and again a band goes out of a city, but it is already unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and we feel honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
In the last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Madhoney and we saw sound gardens on her tour. We are pleased to be still friends with them and we are honored to be part of this settle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours have been with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago. That's the only time that many bands have survived.
First of all, I think that we all appreciate being alive, and we also care about each other.
We are all very good friends, which is why musical ways have opened up, which gives each individual the freedom to experiment.
Someone trusts each other and his music. It couldn't be better for us.
Your relationship with peace has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you can always do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew up has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be too often on tour, because it is too easy to miss this game with huge masses of people who love your music.
As long as you think people have come because of the music, you remember that you have to pay attention to the music and what they have called into life, without neglecting to be a famous rock star.
What kind of memories do you have on your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was great.
For three years we had been a band that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have spent as long as necessary. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built the band with us. When I see a song or photos, I think of what an incredible person Andy was and how he brought me to laughter. It was always a joy to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other subjects.
He was an extraordinary person and we lost him.
The Dutch band Las Robertas is responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and therefore the band has been looking for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band seemed to us the best. That is why we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. This is definitely exciting.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledter when you play live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I don't know.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing he likes.
Who'd you get influenced by as a bassist?
From so many+
For the first ones I like, Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists that fell for me.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the pride in life, even though it is no longer a fashion appearance?
I think we all don't feel very attached to the word Grunge.
When I think about it, I think of the bands I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others who came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I find it great because it is worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are doing better now than you have before.
At first her music was darker, now she's more positive.
Why?
That's interesting, because I think there are some songs on the new album that might be easy to use. But there are also other songs like The End or Just Heart, which are perceived as very dark songs, although they also have some positive effects.
Both of them came to me the tears when I heard how Ed played them. It's very dark songs.
I think if you're older and something traumatic happens in your life - for example, if you lose a family member or a friend - that affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs make it clear to me.
But I am also the view that one can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori came back to the hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was introduced to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the loss of his legs, informing his household.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, 25-year-old son of a man who suffers from human rights abuse during his reign (1990-2000), has had several diseases, including lung cancer, which has been operating four times and under control.
Alejandro Agouñaga, a member of the Congress and his personal doctor, told the TV that Fujimori would spend three days in the Peruvian hospital Instituto National de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the cause of his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Aguunaga commented that his opinion could be challenged for humanitarian reasons by Fujimori. Nevertheless, he did not want this because he held him innocent.
He was operated four times on dental cancer and lost 18 kilos weight. In addition, other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a rash in the spinal cord, kidney stones, blood pressure, and bleeding problems in the legs were reported by the doctor.
Fujimori is located in the Hafttanstalt National Direction of Operations Speciales de la policeía since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squadron of the Peruvian army, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official appointment, initiated by the Uruguayan President José Mujica, and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs begins their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss the political issues of the region
Mujica meets with his Mexican colleague Felipe Calderón the following Wednesday. This will be according to the Uruguay President of the High Point of his issued term plan with politicians, business peoples and a meeting with the collective of the Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The discussion between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara "appropriate for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries", was announced on his website by the President of the South American country.
According to local media, Mujica sought the support of Calderón for the conflict with France, when French government chief Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax paries at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy refused to exclude those countries still acting as a tax paradise from the international community, which was withdrawn from Uruguay and sent a request to his envoy in the European country.
Mexico has since November the President of the G20, a group consisting of the world's most powerful and industrial countries. Since January of this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to prevent the double arrangement with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the ratification of agreements on the exchange of tax information to be drawn up from the 'green list' of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and countries that have not introduced all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
Since 2004, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The fast-paced installer comes with "Super Mario 3D Country" the third dimension
For 25 years, Super Mario has fought relentlessly for the salvation of Princess Peach from the clans of the evil bows, but he has never fought in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he has fought for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which this month comes to the world's loading screens, has been cut off from the start to the characteristics of the portable console Nintend 3DS, with which it can be played without a special brightness three-dimensional.
"Mario is the figure that must say how stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar Álvarez, who is responsible for the press specialized on Nintendo in Spain when the video game is presented in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game by Nintendo, which was originally developed for this console", because until now have been successful articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" adaptations already exist.
The speaker of Nintendo stressed that, although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Country" is a "smooth" video game that allows a fast, flexible game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Country" two games in an understandable: The first part is "light", to catch the less qualified users.
Next, experts on the different levels of play, which will become increasingly difficult, can "run a second round".
In addition, in real time, users can choose between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. To overcome obstacles without sacrificing the "optical effects", however, it must always be played three-dimensional.
This trip to the three-dimensional world of Super Marios also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game Nintendo combines the fans of the Saga and repeats the success of the latest expenses: The fast-paced installer must overcome dangerously high platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player is playing on news on movements, the environment, clothing and enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom serves for the delivery of Portillos in the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this service day, he would take over the delivery of former Governor Alfonso Portillo so that they would be responsible in the United States for the money laundering of $70 million.
Thus, the process ends on the US request for Portillo to be delivered so that it can be brought before the court.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the delivery.
He stressed that he did not intervene in court decisions during his government and that he had made all the delivery requests he had made known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and severe physical injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The Coloms procedure is a government act which takes place when all judicial and constitutional authorities are appointed to judge the former President (2000-2004).
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Guatemalan Constitutional Court, Portillo must be issued if his case is clarified in Guatemala and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was released in the Ministry of Defence during his government's time for the destruction of 120 million Quetzales. This was the first time that the issue was delivered, but the Minister objected to the new case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people from social exclusion
The organization was called to prevent the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the social assistance organization Trinijove have had significant results: in this four-year period, 6,000 young people were supported by social exclusion to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, over a hundred jobs have been created for this social group.
At the end of the year, an event was held in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, in which more than 300 people participated.
Trinijove was called in 1986 at Trinitate Vella City Square with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work, with drug problems that were at risk of marginality.
At the recent festival in San Andreu, numerous responsible members of the institutions and institutions who have worked together with the Union during these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives in different directions to electoral times contributed to the impartiality of the work performed by Trinijove.
In addition to the President-in-Office of the Generality (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol took part in the celebrations of former socialist Minister of Education Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and current Left-Green Citytrat Richard Goma.
The Grand Chamber of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalan Minister for Social Affairs and Family, Joseph Lluís Clerees, and the Director General of the Social Work of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mass stressed that Trinijove was called into life in very difficult times and that today's times are not less complicated. But he added that the work that has been done so far "is a good foundation".
For the Presidents of the Generality, Trinijove is an example of the fight against difficult circumstances and the hope of people in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is for the union and the work it does is nothing new," he explained.
Occupied house in which the rice parties were held was destroyed
The owners had 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the street Balmes No 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve housekeepers left the building yesterday afternoon without resistance.
All points to the end of the Alps of the neighbors of the house No. 51 on the street of Balmes.
Twelve people left the building on Wednesday freely, where they had been illegally detained and in which they had organized huge walls that had moved the neighborhood to confusion. The room was brought to justice without police interference.
After the opening, the door was removed to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," the household administrator confirmed.
The housekeepers, who owned 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest of them lived - took with them the entire electrical plant and part of the water supply. In addition, they planted the walls and left all kinds of furniture, especially doses with alcohol drinks.
In the three floors, huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to confusion.
In addition to the building, there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also caused damage.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained that her business would go back to 80% since the start of the household.
The owners of the discotheque indicated that the owners made their unsolicited competition because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they spent 10 euros on the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the place of leisure was shown by the neighbors because of the disturbance, while their speech of the noise was not caused by the visitors of the disc, but by the owners and especially by the guests of the party who were organized there, and who were more and more, according to the statements of the wounded neighbors in the last weeks.
The administrators of the discotheque explained that the compensation was so great that they agreed with the owner of the building that they would not have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (city police) also confirmed that they had received more complaints from their neighbors in the last few weeks.
The President of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in Barcelona City, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had asked for the building to be destroyed immediately and to obtain the problems of civil life as well as the arrival of the city quarter.
He explained that just one floor of the building had been occupied before the summer, but that the housekeepers in the last few months had been impressed with all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments. In some it even came to roofs.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to deal with social actions in the building."
Yesterday another building was built in the city square of Nou Barris by the Catalan police.
At 15.30 p.m., the police approached Montreal Street No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed how four people wanted to enter the building.
The four were arrested unexpectedly.
Park or mountain?
The architects are distinguished from the strategists of the Honorary.
The city's description of the 16 towers opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona to New.
In the mid-80s, at the height of the lost Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its gossip on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in numbers to the Central Park of New York.
With the collapse of the CMB in 1987, the park became more and more at the top of Barcelona, as the capital of Catalonia belongs to the few who do not extend to the north-south, but to the top (the mountains) and the bottom (the sea).
The creation of Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
As a model, not now the Central Park, but Yellowstone with Wildsween in the role of Yogibar.
As far as the city was concerned in September, a Russian inscription, consisting of 16 competitions, was issued for further access stores to Collserola.
No doubt a tower refers to the concept of a park.
Either that's the way it is, or someone's got to put towers on the ground.
The question is itself: Collserola, park or mountain?
The description is not only of an organisational view, but also in view of a reflection on the city the subject of conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring subject that can be referred back to the two members of this old box, who are in attendance.
And that is exactly what this fact offers for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors who have competed on the project.
Miguel Rolldan, Daniel Modol and Martha Bayona: The description is appropriate.
For Rollan, "it is necessary" after the attack on the coast on the "front on the mountain" until the talk by Ildefons Cerda, which has been delivered over the green apples, has not been delivered.
"From the principle that Barcelona is the largest park of the beach.
Among other things, because he's very accessible.
Collserola is complex", explains the architect, for which the title "Tore of Collserola" is a "lexical case" in itself: "It is not possible to imagine "as access to a park, but as an integration of areas on which it must be treated."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, considers the proposal to be an "intellectual challenge", the "some dangers" in itself.
This is because of the "uncertainty that brings about the design of a public space today" after the experiences of the 1980s, which had in the Forum's field their "schanging" song.
The first fear is self-reliance on what can be built.
"If there is a limit, it always means to determine the next step", i.e. to exceed it.
"I have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [particularly to the plan General Metropolitano (GPM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, which is more concerned with the question, simply means that the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park which is not in the direction of Barcelona", and for purely topographical reasons.
Modol reminds us that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola, which should not "be on top of deaf ears", although it is grateful to the city administration that it has given his group the opportunity to work on this project "from the first moment on".
He also notes that the approach of the mountain to the city of leadership is that it enables the architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "disquieting" as to whether this technical profile of multidisciplinary teams called into life ("just the right", he says) should be initiated "We architects should be just a tool."
Bayona points out that the answer to the question in the appendix to this article is complex because in the terms of the statement there is a global view of Collserola: "There have been 16 competitions written in the Quartet section", he says, "on the Axse Mountain Sea. But there is no long-term perspective that considers the area as a whole."
This has at least led to his participation in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a tower with the architecture of the tower would collify.
According to his opinion, the city should ensure that the columns are equipped directly over the Ronda de Dalt throughout its entire length, which creates a difficult transition between the city and the Green Zones.
Casino releases Jonas Larrazabal, who comes free
After 72 days, the official of the Casino Red released the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey from the process that is being carried out against him because of possible repression.
After 72 days of detention, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal was released after being released from prison by the official of the Casino Red before the second court of the District, which led to the trial against the mayor of Monterrey for his arrest.
After paying attention to the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonas must be obliged to pay for a sum of money so that city administration will allow the secret operation of the Wetthouse.
After the crime scene, the state administration opened a criminal procedure against the brother of the Panist Mayor, who was arrested on 2 September for 30 days.
After four hours with the officials of the Ministry of Público 3 and Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in Barrio Antiguo, the capital.
He remained there 49 days after a second court order, after which the officials of the Ministry of the Republic of Publico had prosecuted the crimes because of the theft and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to Cadereyta's port station because he must have visited the owner of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. However, he stayed only a few hours in the middle security extract, as murder threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the court procedure as a prisoner of the city prison of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, gave him a federal regulation, which stated that there was sufficient evidence to show that, after almost two months of investigation, Jonas was found to be guilty of paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the Wett house to open it against.
This Monday, the official of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked Justice José Luis Pecina, the mayor's brother to release the sentence, which is why he will be put on his own foot in the next hours.
During the hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministry of the Court, Público, García Gómez, asked whether they had suffered the damage and who the owner of the Wett house had spoken of his confession.
According to legal case 197/2011, Jonas Larrazábal is free to speak. No claims can be made against the process, nor will any damage be required.
Following the hearing of the official of the Wetthouse v. 15.50, Larsabal Bretón was immediately put on his free foot.
The judge, Jorge Yánez, went to San Nicolas de los Garza City Prison to inform Jonas that he had been released and that his case would be brought to justice.
He also informed him of the legal arrangement for the immediate release.
The secretary, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, gives details of the plane crash, where the government secretary Francisco Blake and seven others came to life.
The Secretariat of Communications y Transports - SCT (Secretariat for Communications and Transport in Mexico) informed that the investigation results from the accident involving the government Secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven others about life indicate that the hijacker has been directly told of the ground with its entire undisputed structure without the pilot being able to launch an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dioniso Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communication and Transport, said that the pilot had confirmed before the start that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller planes had contact with trees in 25 meters high, where the hijacker lost the sound, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several underground contacts."
He also explained that the hijacker was built for 19 inches, so he met all the conditions for the transport of the staff.
In addition, he said that no hijackings were found in the areas where the machine was located.
"In the search, no parts of aircraft were found at other locations, which covered the entire structure.
The hijacker was built for 19 steps, so he met all the conditions for the transport of persons.
The area shows a depth of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present it is essential to obtain the results of the investigation as soon as possible, however, these months may last for a year, perhaps even a year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeroports y Servicios Auxiliaires (Secretariat for Aircraft and Assistance Services in Mexico), assured that the hijacker from the statedo Major Presidential was flying at the speed of the flight and that the aircraft was hit by a soft turn.
"This information reinforces the belief that it was at the time of the outbreak of normal flight operations."
At a press conference, the Heads of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points to be taken into account in the investigation:
View speed:
In line with the flight patterns, it was a flight according to the rules of the flight. This means that the man had to have had a sufficient view during the flight and on the ground.
Air conditioning conditions:
The AICM listed appropriate weather conditions at the start. During the follow-up to the border area between Mexico City and Mexico, several deep-depending clouds appeared.
Selected river sizes:
It is possible that because of the clouds, the man had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Upcoming device:
The flight coordinates and the last radar marking of the lift driver agree. Perhaps there has been no loss of control over the aircraft or a difference from the plane before the flight.
Extension of the excess of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available up to now indicates that the hijacker has been informed directly and indirectly.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft may suggest that the hijacker was mounted on the ground with its undiscovered structure.
No references to fire or explosion:
The rest of the aircraft can be offered in the event of an accident either on fire or on explosion.
The last results of the investigation were on several ground contacts.
During the field tests, parts of aircraft were found at a height of 9200 feet above sea level. The ground is dry and shows a depth of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the hacker is probably going to break.
Some information suggests that the Hubschoper could have several underground contacts.
After a minute search into a area that was out of the outlying area, no expanded aircraft was found, which confirmed the agreement that the undisclosed aircraft structure was spoken against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to find the gene for fattyness
The Mexican Social Insurance Agency is leading a research project to find the gene for fattyness in children and young people supported by IPN specialists.
The Institute of Mexicoo del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Agency of Mexico) announced that there is a research project for the detection of pregnancy in children and adolescents under the heading "Genetics of pregnancy in childhood and youth", which should be found in relation to genetic markers.
Miguel Cruz López, director of Unidad de Investigación Médica en Biochemicala (Departement for Medical Research, Biochemistry) at the Clinic Hospital de Specialities del Centro Médico National Siglo XXI stated that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition professionals and social workers was built.
This team is supported by specialists and students of postgraduate studies at Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and at Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico National (IGN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interestes can come to the IMSS sports sites in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and young people are conducted every Saturday at 8.00 p.m.
He stressed that the investigation began at the sport site of Cuuhtémoc (in the west of the state of Mexico) and continued on the sport site of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of Mexico).
When the goal of 500 to 600 surveyers is achieved, the study will be continued at the sports site of Independencia (in the south of the capital area) and completed at Morelos (Northern of the capital area).
He explained that the aim of the study was to identify the factors and the role of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors for Mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
At the end of the World Day of Diabetes, he explained that three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14 should be able to fill out the food questionnaires and under the supervision of their parents.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and their family history of disease to control risk factors that may result from diabetes or kidney failure.
He further indicated that on the said Saturdays, the subjects (weight, size, size), their blood pressure would be controlled and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors would be determined.
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out at the expense of the health care of young people with alarming weight loss.
"The health questions from 1999 and 2006 revealed that in almost six years the proportion of fatty boys has increased by 77% and girls with obesity by 47%. Overweights have also been dramatic," the IMSS Specialist stressed.
He explained that the search for genetic marks had been justified because the genetic history of the people of Mexico differed from that of the other peoples.
He pointed out that a (e) Mexican (in) average of 65 per cent of Indian-Americans, 30 per cent of Europeans and 5 per cent of African descent is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of fatty life are inexhaustible to burn the excess of energy taken to us (calorie) so that it will be introduced in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefits of the survey participants were included in a comprehensive study of the children, which would determine whether they showed a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even examine the occurrence of dark skin rash in the neck and in the intestines (Acanthosis), which indicates the likelihood of drug exchanges and diabetes in the prestationary.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all the measurement results and recommend changes in the lifestyle that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors that are responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of movement, which is a lack of movement every day, to spend most of the day in front of the TV and use means of transport, instead of taking short steps to walk.
The high intake of calories, i.e. an increased consumption of sugard beverages and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) together with high fat and egg intake, as well as the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM Prevented Squadron
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the University of Chemicals at the University of Mexico UNAM, developed modified asphalts with polymers to make the mixture resistant to weather conditions and temperature changes
It would not be necessary to repair almost 200 000 shells if the rain time of the Zone Metropolitana del Valle de México (Mexican Valley Valley Valley area), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the University of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warned and assured that if the discharge and maintenance of the stock lot were appropriate, the number of shells would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his speech "Smokers from a Technical View", which he used for the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, developed modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, but which has a greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Mr Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt in areas with extremely hot climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the street gang and to prevent the occurrence of injuries.
He explained that asphalt - the most severe part of the soil oil - is a combination of hydrocarbons, part of which has a high molecular weight - the asphaltes - and the other part a low - the so-called Malthene. Together they give the road surface its characteristic digital behaviour.
Digital behaviour of the asphalt means that it is held at high temperatures of about 180 °C as a fluid, at 120 °C it is very dense and is almost fixed at 50 °C while it is used at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the streets is not equal, but changes one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature changes," the chemical engineer said.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City had mostly a flexible road cover consisting of six material vessels, of which the last three were held.
Between the upper layers is a layer of asphalt, which consists of small, solid stones built in Asphalt and then fortified.
Every individual stone of this treasure ship was built in Asphalt.
If the vehicles continue to move and power is created, this ship enables a good distribution of forces in the road deck.
"If it were a modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed," said the chemical engineer.
"On the skiing boat," he said, "the last ship will be set up, the so-called trawl ship consisting of winch stones, i.e. sand, which was also built in Asphalt.
Since these ships are in contact with the vehicle wheels, they need a greater mechanical force than the steering wheel and they need to be driven.
In addition, the bulk of this road cover receives and distributes, the trajectory needs to be kept in order to maintain a proper thickness and the material from which it is made.
The weather conditions, in particular humidity and temperature changes, are also important for taking into account factors, above all, the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the mixture.
When the ground melts, water penetrates into the vessel and becomes difficult again. This causes an increase in all the layers of the road wall and thus the presence of the shells.
When a disaster occurs," he said, "the deck is first removed, while the ship is affected only then. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that needs to be stopped at the first signs by appropriate maintenance programmes."
The member of the National de Investigadores (National Research System in Mexico) explained that the vehicle load is another important reason for the presence of impactors. Therefore, the tyres of each side of the road must always be in relation to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is kept in order to avoid frequent noises.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many more research work is still waiting for, for example, asphalt emulsions that have already been on the market in other countries, with which the victims simply and without applying high temperatures have been repaired.
What was missing from the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna's not getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th Missile.
Once again, Valle del Cauca was empty in giving the crown to Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied to stand on the winner podium, to watch a silver crown and the band that appeared to her as new Miss Colombia.
With the result of this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the soil, the Department is already on 14 mysticals and Melina is due to the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had held the crowns in their hands. Among them are Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Rosa Maria Álvarez (1981), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Romano (1990), Diana Isabel Rome (1993), Giselle Garrerere (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007).
The big question that many ask today is: What's wrong?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite who showed in every performance that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not only was she chosen to be the queen of the police and Major Rostro Jolie by Vogue, who also received the beautiful daughters of Taliana Vargas and Natalie Navarro, who took the crowns of Miss Colombia with home.
The first factor that is crucial to the decision of the jury to appoint her to the first Miss is that she did not believe the answer to the question "Which book has affected you most, and why?" that she had been asked by Martín Murillo Gómez by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca told the questionnairer:
"I read a lot, I believe quite in literature, I think it's a kind of civilisation, and finally I think that the book that was most appreciated for my childhood, 'The little prince', is a very far-reaching book.
At present I read 'School and Sühne'. It is a book of universal culture that we all should read. I just read a book from Irene Nimirovski, a Russian, a wonderful book entitled 'Liences'.
An answer that came to little attention, first because of the term 'citizenize' and second, because she had not specifically explained how each of her so-called books had affected her.
But after the ceremony ended, Melina explained, to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is way, it happens what must happen.
And for all people, please read a little 'the little prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that El Valle's favorite is burned.
A journalist from Bogota pointed out that the fact that she was the preferred person who had received all the events and in advance all the prices (Gastronomy competition Oster, public opinion on the best cut-off costume and Reina Madre), "had made the other candidates exhausted, which the Queen was therefore unable to smooth on the stage."
And this was noted in their first presentation on the beach of the Hilton Hotel, and in their two rides at the funeral party.
Although she was safe in both of them, she lacked the strength and courage that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico put on guard.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" program at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was stolen from the miss "shows that the candidate who won most of the prizes during the competition will not eventually be queen".
In addition, Vale went to the end of the press from the way - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is the most important part of the national beauty competition.
It is already his reason that two days before the International Jury Lucy Doutty meeting, they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Greed alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look at the body and focus on the social feeling, because it had already worked with projects before taking part in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned with her defects of the third and fibrosis, which you have noticed in the magic field. But this is disgusting because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good nutrition habits and responsible physical work.
The Queen's trainer, Jorge Hernán Orozco, suggests that Melina did not have the best body to give it better, "but her problem with the fibrosis in the trunk, which I was told to hardly notice, pressed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos from the Cromos magazine saw the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical effects she had been subjected to.
"The operations are also, but Valle didn't know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place had to pay."
Because of this price, which was first awarded by the national beauty competition, after the event in the bath area, there was a grim prediction that should be true in the night. It was exchanged that Raymondo Melina had given a trolley price so that they would not be allowed to come into the benefit of the crown.
Whether that is true or not, the fact is that Melina has since entered her royal year, although not as queen, but as Princess, a position that she offers the opportunity to appoint the national beauty competition Colombia in one of the international competitions.
However, she will enter the history as one of the kings who, despite her overwhelming experience with Cartagena, lost the crown.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A lophoscopist from Cali went into history as the man who identified Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officers plays a key role.
On the last 4 November, a Lophoscopist of the intelligence unit of the state government (CTI) from Cali was the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolutionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary War Forces of Colombia) by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week, Eliazar González had worked as a preparation service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigation procedures for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in communities of Chocó, where he often had to spend five days in the jungle to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were located.
In 2000, he spent himself on lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin, which is used for the joints, i.e. the hands and feet, after completing the required course.
During the week of application against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was directed to pack clothing for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he flew into the hive from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that the suspicion was that one of the men who led the oldest Guerrilla in the world could be one. Therefore he should include the ten-finger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he reached the place where the bodies were located, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, as this was not at least the images he had seen in the mass media.
He didn't have a bar, he was like a farmer in the area, he didn't wear glasses and he was very thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a lupe, tinte, a plant source and a bag lamp, Eliazar compares the fingerprints of the bodies with those on the printed page.
He had seen it right: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for informing the Defence Minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was indeed the head of the FARC.
On-the-fly search
The statement made by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use of "cano" was very important for a bishop of Sijín in Cali.
Many people don't know our work.
The daktyloscopy is an accurate science without error rate, which can be a key actor when solving a penalty.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support findings in murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the persons arrested.
When they are arrested, many criminal authorities have or do not have false warrants.
We take the fingerprints from them and search them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to pull a piece of wall out of a house at a dibstain, because the dib had stood right at this place with his hand when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"We are difficult because their surfaces are inadequate for the removal of fingerprints. But in this case we were able to take the print out of the whole hand and identify the criminal officer who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
With the help of fingerprints, killers can also be released or loaded.
Before long, a dot was found surrounded by flakes.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be suspicious, and actually agreed a fingerprint on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is about the killer, he will be associated with the place where the penalty was committed.
A Dactyloscopist of the CTI stated that "the fingerprints would be taken from the object by chemical or physical agents."
If they appear, a plant cell or band will be used for adoption.
Then the prints will be sent to the asset, which is the criminal database, or to the person's staff.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without visas," the CTI expert explained.
He didn't mean everything as it would be in the SCI TV series.
Like not all gold, what shines is not everything you catch is a fingerprint.
However, it can be used if a proper comparison is made.
The Emports demand the authorities out of New York
Hundreds of demonstrators pushed together in cells on the Zuccotti square.
A large part came to the room order and changed its location into a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement asked the New York authorities on this service day when they again tried to enter the Manhattan Square after they had been removed from the place in the morning and had tried to take another place at Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators raced in front of the Zuccotti Square, where they, with a judicial order, wanted to gain access to the new cells at this site. Meanwhile, another part of the movement to the space command continued to occupy a park north of the city where it came to nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp on the spot, we will meet in another place and continue the fight with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Brey, one of the speakers of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Brey pointed out that the answer of the "emportees" to the room of her cellmate, who was directed directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came before the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent space of the place and allowing demonstrators to use the cells.
In addition, the "emportees" have a new park that is located at the crossing of the central Channel Street and the Sixth Avenue all near the entrance to the Dutch tunnel, New York and New Jersey, and is owned by the Trinity Church.
They could have owned the place for at least an hour, but then the police met and arrested some of the demonstrators, even though Brey was unable to give the exact number. He assured the news agency Efe that he had seen several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization ensures that hundreds of people have found themselves at this point, where religious leaders have also been appointed as symbols of their support for the movement and the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square (a private area) remains closed in the expectation of a fair hearing which is still to be held for this service day and should be analysed with the legality of the room in the morning.
Some of the demonstrators at the scene took photos of this ruling order and distributed them. They even gave them some police officers who were watching the scene, which had "a few small meetings" as reported by Brey, who had shown that some policemen had killed demonstrators.
The judicial instruction prohibits the authorities to remove members of Occupy Wall Street from the place and the application of "laws adopted after the occupation and to prohibit the demonstrators from returning to the park with their cells and other things they had previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that because of this legal arrangement, the opening of the public transport and the demonstrators had been opened up. The demonstrators showed that the city laws did not allow them to settle again with cells and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the area of the Zuccotti Square, which was held in the morning, where nearly 200 people were arrested, and was determined because the demonstrators "distorted against the law."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the arrangement to make room for the place because it "had turned into a place where people didn't come to demonstrate, but to break the law and in some cases to add harm to other people", because "some businesses would have received smokes" and the inhabitants were afraid of "their quality of life".
"The room in the morning was modest and shows that Bloomberg is interested in the protection of the financial interests and not in the protection of the interests of North American workers," added the speaker of the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting the freedom of press".
The officials of "Occupy Wall Street" informed them that they were thinking about organizing "great actions" for the Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to think about the two months that the protests have been going on since 17 September.
Pamela Anderson is the young woman Maria at the TV wedding show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, it will be held on 1 December in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian woman Pamela Anderson was Tim Allens Assistant in "Home Improvement", salvation Swimming in "Baywatch", Kaninchen at "Playboy", the wife of the rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actor and model at a Canadian television night.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, together with the "crooner" (Balladeen singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on 1 December in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and will be hosted by a very special young woman Maria Life.
CTV distributed today images of the television program, in the Anderson - also for the distribution on the Internet of a self-run porno, in which she, together with her former husband, appears to be the victim of "Mötley Crée", Tommy Lee, as a young woman Maria with a doll in the shoe that Jesus is supposed to represent.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, recently worked as a moderator at the "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" mission by Charlie Sheen as Jesus.
The CTV Christmas program is not only based on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires and who is not far from this controversy.
Bublé recently called North American Kim Kardashian "hour" at a concert in New York.
Japan will be reborn after the earthquake
The BIP grows by 1.5% thanks to the domestic consumption and ends the spiral of the free case from early March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, which is still in the generation after the devastating earthquake that struck a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster that Japan has experienced in World War II.
The government's first estimates in Tokyo estimated the damage to $300,000, a blow that seems to weaken despite the difficult world economy.
After three quarters, the data on the gross domestic product from July to September were finally completed: the GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the annual quota.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan begins the business year in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The refurbishment may be explained partly by the machinery sales for the new construction of the soil and the following Tsunami areas.
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the return of 0.9% for capital institutions registered from January to March, the first return after six months of unsustainable increase.
Nevertheless, the real transformation of the Japanese economy is not solely based on Kenyan attacks using the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructures.
The rise is particularly due to Japan's development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, despite rising costs for vehicles, travel and leisure.
The Stigma of Yen
Tokyo has trusted the domestic market after the Yen - the Japanese currency - in one of the "insurance guarantees" of the investors flying in front of the Eurozone debt crisis and the corrupt forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that is as a gravestone on the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a tougher currency, the products abroad are expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, brought their weak business results from July to September back to the notes of the Yen.
While the markets continue to stock the peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda remains growing.
"I must take into account the risks involved, for example, the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of overcrowding in Thailand and the rapid assessment of Yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
The perspectives are not really very impressive.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that in September most Member States would have shown more clear signs of slowing down economic development.
The indicator, leading to the world's turning point, pointed out that the brakes would be taken at the largest economic potential.
Because he fell from four tenths to lose 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average value, which is at 100 after it has fallen by eight tenths at 99.13 points.
Athens has doubts about it again
Papadimos says the savings measures would be adopted, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high risk premiums of the peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece continues to be plagued by the Labyrinth that comes out of the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensual" of the new Greek transitional government is rather a response to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of political forces is slowed down by facts.
The new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundreds of days that he appointed were likely to be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured him that he would support the new savings measures and would not, in any case, withdraw his request for new elections on the date set out on 19 February.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken on the summit of 26 October," Papadimos promised yesterday to open a parliamentary debate, which will be reached by the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 employment promotion programmes, reform of the disciplinary law for officials and new measures against taxation are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's communication does not raise doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but nothing else."
The conservative leader took a step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organization that needs the 8000 million people in Athens, and he made it clear that he would not be pleased with a commitment statement on the implementation of the savings measures.
However, the European Commission, which is still alarmed by the effects of the poker game with Papandreu Referenceendum, confirmed yesterday that it would not be late for its request: the economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the most important Greek parties signed "a clear written agreement not as soon as possible".
The speaker of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of Troika returned "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government, "what was needed for the payment of the sixth section" of EUR 8000 million, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek knife is still for a long foot.
King Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The King stressed the "precise" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has reached a dominant position in the role of small funding worldwide".
The King Sofia of Spain recalled yesterday that in the last two decades Spain has developed itself as the second donor to this means of international cooperation. Its "We know" suggests that it is a " instrument for social progress, justice and the hope for a better future for all humanity on the basis of confidence in man".
The Queen refused to enter the fifth World Summit on Small Credits in Valladolid yesterday. She was convinced that there was "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "absolutely impossible" in order to achieve the Millennium Shares set by the United Nations by 2015 and "in particular the goal of living with less than one dollar per day, so under the " poverty limit".
Spain "continues to work" at the extension of the benefit network "to the last corner of the world and this task takes full responsibility," noted King Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions from the summit that will continue until Thursday, "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for doctors and, in particular, for women" are guaranteed as key beneficiaries of this loan.
"We've made a lot of progress" and "there's a lot of challenges."
The summit on small credit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for "two fundamental objectives".
The Queen stated that it would be hoped that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families would have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households would exceed the poverty limit.
The concept of Small Credits goes back to Spain and the rest of the world to the "Initiated Way Years ago" considered by Muhammad Yunus as a "Act of Justice and Recognition" by King Sofia.
The father of this funding instrument described her as a "famous idealist who had written the fight against poverty" and whose work she had known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about the loan strategy.
In this experience, one year later, the first world summit in Washington and other meetings at the Elfene cost in 1999 and Canada in 2006. At the time of all, "we can observe a continuous further development", the Queen, whose commitment to this project had recently been assessed as a "family head" in Valladolid and as a "prison of the poor".
Finally, the King Sofia concluded its speech by encouraging the participants to participate in the debate and to seek solutions to the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Order"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is a "ethical offer" for the whole democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to bind the development aid to economic trees, because it was a "long-term commitment".
Jiménez was of the opinion that small credit is a "first and most rigorous policy for the eradication of poverty", and that the governments of the industrial states now had to work "more often" on solid criteria, and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to fall to the victim.
For Spain, small credits are one of the most important forms of development assistance.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, highlighted "the success", "marginized" people, "the always before closed doors" "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, welcomed the residents of a city, who opened "their towers, marked by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to select EU Presidents on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the convention of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig) loved Angela Merkel, Chancellor and president of the Christian-Democratic Party, without any real difficulties.
Europe's future was not originally foreseen in the programme, but it was in the autumn, in particular in order to provide enough for those activists who consider government policies to be of interest to the Greeks today and possibly to be considered by Italy to be too low tomorrow.
The Presidency's proposal for a Presidency of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, ten had held the vote.
The several minutes of stand-up evasion, which began to look like Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble, have not been able to open any doubts since the three European ministers to be appointed.
The main time of the Chancellor is - as well as the request - the following slogan: the response to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time for a breakthrough has come in Europe".
This could be expressed through an amendment to the Lisbon Treaty to the budget policy of the countries in the euro area, which could also be expressed by the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote" in the election of the President of the European Commission".
However, this is in any case one of the applications accepted by the Congress, which clearly stood by Wolfgang Schäubble Pate.
Of course, it is very unlikely that the 47 will soon agree on this revolution: Great Britain is against the issue, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone is located.
In a overwhelming majority, the delegates also rejected the proposal for the weighting of each country in the ECB's position according to the weight of the individual economies, which obviously required an increase in Germany's position.
Therefore, the chancellor, who looked at the climate within her party, has strengthened the points of reference to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty who would immediately criticize the rising Germany.
As long as the European application for the importance of the "German-French friendship" is a paragraph, Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds us that Leipzig stood in the middle of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the highest dwindling lows of the Napoleonic army.
What is the problem with disease reports?
Following family assistance, UMP and the government are now taking the medical messages into action.
Nicolas Sarkozy will meet on Tuesday, 15 November in Bordeaux to find a family assistance package and talk about this - ever repeated since 2007 - the subject of the fight against social and economic dependence from the state.
In order to accompany this attack, which is aimed at subduing the economy in a severe trial, on the other hand, but not less than the offer of an axis of the right presidential campaign, the majority would like to focus on employee complaints.
Firstly with budgetary objectives: the Government intends to introduce a fourth career day in view of a health message for workers in the private sector.
In good German this means that a sick employee would lose the pay of four days without the approval of the specific company, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A mavnomme that, according to the newspaper "Les Echos" Zorn, would help bring in 280 million euros.
And what was more symbolic with another mavnaem came to the attention of the state officials in the event of illness (as long as it is for them, in contrast to the three days in the private sector, there are no deadlines).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also again draws attention to the problem of unemployment, which this time is aimed at the abuse of labour.
"Controls will be significantly more important, and in addition, they will be reimbursed when required," Xavier cautioned Betrand on Sunday, 13 November before the microphone of the sender RTL.
As in other cases, the effects of this Communication on the reality of fraudulent practices in the field of disease reports seem somewhat disproportionate.
This has already been the subject of permanent observation since 2002 as well as political offensives which have been the most common of the fruits.
The French are no longer more frequent than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, first we refer to the national figures.
According to the CCAM, more than EUR 237 million were paid in 2006.
As a result of the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health, the daily expenditure in 2008 amounted to EUR 11.3 billion, 5% of health expenditure.
This amount includes 46% of maternity leave, labour accidents and 54% of sickness leave, which has EUR 6.2 billion.
And then 2.5% health expenditure.
In 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009, the French people were admitted to a study of the Alma Consulting Group on average only 14.5 days of illness.
A mean value, which changed some differences: another website, published in 2007 by Monster.com, for career planning, showed that 75% of the 40 000 asked French workers did not have to take a single day of illness.
Another study found this time by the health insurance reveals that 37% of the disease reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% more.
Thus, compared with their European neighbours, French workers no longer tend to work in a different way.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French Centre for Science Research (CNRS) showed that the global outflow rate (based on disease or otherwise) was oscillating between 1994 and 2001, while in France between 10% and 11% compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
In the case of reports of disease, the proportion of black work is low.
As far as the company is concerned, there is only a weak outlet.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 indicates that there are systematic controls on diseases that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university for the education and further education of technicians and engineers) determined under 1.5 million controls that 13% of the 285,000 short-term disease reports that had been "unjusted or too long" in 37.050 cases.
In the systematicly controlled cases of disease for more than 45 days, among 1.2 million, 11% were "unadjusted or uncorrected" cases, which have 132,000.
In total, this makes 169,000 "unjusted" cases on several million workers who have made a medical report.
A figure representing only a weak sample against those of black work, for example.
According to UMP coordinator Dominique Tian, author of a report published in July on this issue, this is between EUR 9 and 15 billion a year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily payments, and therefore more than the deficit in the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adjustment programme to start its economy.
This was announced on Monday, 14 November, by Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos, before Parliament, in addition to the fact that his Government had failed to fulfil this task by a hundred days since the end of the Union.
"In order to continue the efforts to further strengthen the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," the Head of Government said in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on Parliament's confidence vote on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions adopted on 27 October by the Euro-Mediterranean meeting was the "main task" of the new government, as the country's involvement within the Eurozone "in the game", as it added.
Similarly, Mr Papademos planned to reduce the country's "9%" deficit of gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights enjoy the new sponsorship
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his consent to the already approved mammary measures in connection with an attempt to withdraw from the debt crisis, but he predicted that his party would not be willing to receive additional savings.
"We are not going to vote in favour of new taboos," he said at a parliamentary meeting of his party's New Democracy.
However, he had already stated that, with the aim of reducing budget deficits and debt, as well as combating abuse, any policy was hostile to the economic downturn.
Olli Rehn, an EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who had prevented the IWF and the EU from providing the necessary loans over EUR 8 billion without providing written guarantees to all parties on their support for planned savings, had responded to Antonio Samaras that his word would suffice and he would not sign anything under the pressure of Auben.
Euthanasia and accompanying Freitod must be legalised, so an expert grade
The Canadians live in order to avoid death, as reported by the Canadian Royal Society
The Panel stated that governments, health institutions and doctors worked together to prepare the best painkillers, as well as the cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in a denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians are actually able to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and make provisions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of a taxable report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved, linked to different fields of expertise, including ethics, law and medicine.
This group recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow a joint suicide and euthanasia where this choice takes place, and that such a decision be taken in patients who are considered to be in a position to make such a decision.
As a commission, the experts refer to a recent published survey of the independent company EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada has placed itself on the 10th floor, the study notes that "the medical death care in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to cut off the subject of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, so we are informed by the experts ordered by the Canadian Royal Society.
And despite the majority of Canadians' desire to die at home, 68.6% of those in the hospital eventually die.
From the whole country, the rate is at the highest in Quebec, with 86% of deaths in the hospital.
In the issue of euthanasia and accompanying Switzerland, the author of the report is faced with conclusions that the federal government, which has already adopted, would like to make no amendments to the law on euthanasia and accompanying Switzerland.
However, there is now no evidence that such criminalisation would lead to the practice of euthanasia or accompanying suicide by persons who are not competent or unwilling to do so.
On the contrary, there are a number of cases of such transmissions in the countries where euthanasia and accompanying Switzerland are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, rapporteur of the report, confirmed in a teleconferencing conference yesterday.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada where it is clearly illegal."
"Suizid is also practiced in Canada, although clearly illegal here," explains Jocelyn Downnie.
Canadians Approve the Euthanasia
Today, we believe that 85% of Canadians have already been subjected to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010 in favour of euthanasia, as they are of the opinion that it allowed people to ease their suffering at the end of their life course.
And 66% believe that the nature of the legalization of euthanasia has no effect on conveying the message that the lives of older or disabled people are less valuable.
With regard to those who have already practiced a co-existence, 41% of the respondents are of the opinion that they should not be prosecuted.
As regards the maintenance or administration of the funds in patients, the situation is less clear, so the author of the report.
They also set out in their recommendation list that the penalty law should specify that the abolition of the funds for which a legal ban was imposed should not be considered criminal.
The expert body also calls for experts of health to be kept in charge of respecting a provision of the means of life, and this must be feared without criminal prosecution.
The Panel stated that governments, health institutions and doctors worked together to prepare the best painkillers, as well as the cancer cases.
Finally, in relation to the resources already widely used in the Canadian institutions for health care, the Panel calls for the reduction of pain or life-threatening diseases, at least to be taken into account, as they are less than the euthanasia, to reduce physical pain and to deal with the same procedures.
Preservation of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already provided for the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a health specialist, has called the attitude of reporting experts among others "extrem", since they do not set any limits for the euthanasia practice in patients at the end stage.
"This opens the door to a situation in which one who is dead and is under 18 years of age asks another person to be helpful to him in his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who had reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report appear to have the responsibility of the individual over all other values that are involved in the social activities of the society.
But now, he says, there are "guilt lines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a health law specialist, also called "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she titled as "Pro-Euthanasia-Manifest".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, is a member of Canada, and in particular the reports on the non-exploitation of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanying Switzerland are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls President Assad on power
Damascus spreads a "Complet" on
Syria is more isolated
The Bashar al-Assads have demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on the Syria Baschar al-Assads, which, thanks to Russia's support and a "computt" directed against the country, has increased yesterday.
Two days before the Syrian exile by the Arab League, the European Union had intensified its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring Syrian countries, had taken a position in favour of the resignation of President Assad.
King Abdullah II. Jordan's former Arab Prime Minister, President Baschar al-Assad, had asked him to "substantiate his authority in Syria", which had already been killed by the fourteenth civilists and members of the government.
"Let Bashar put his country's interests in his heart, so he would fall away, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," said the king of Jordan, next country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish Diplomatic Chief Ahmet Davutoglu, on the other hand, had regretted that the Turkish intelligence test had not been successful since the beginning of the year.
"Those in the Middle East who cannot be at peace with their people and cannot satisfy this must go," he explained in a speech to Syria, the neighbouring country, to which Turkey takes a constant stand of fierceness.
The United States, on the other hand, has rejected the "consultation of the consensus against Assad and the powers of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries such as Turkey have hit a ever stronger tone in view of the repressions in Syria," said Mark Toner, a spokesman of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government were killed in the region of Dar'a in southern Syria, thus announcing the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH.
Two other civilians, according to this NGO, had come to life in the town of Homs, where they were buried.
At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim was still looking at the country's "tax at the end of the crisis".
On the other hand, he reacted by drawing attention to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its tasks, which reflected his appreciation for a "hazardous step".
Syria "will not be followed", he added under the authority, "the conspiracy against Syria would fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also spoke in favour of sending UN observers to protect civilians from the regime's repression that he was trapped in his "paranoia".
A comprehensive reconvened meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow to discuss the implementation of the plan on the rise of the crisis decided on 2 November, in particular the controversial, predictable withdrawal of military troops from the fortified cities and the release of detained demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergej Lawrow introduced the Arab League's decision yesterday as "uncorrected" to condemn possible sanctions against Damascus, although China had already recommended the implementation of the crisis plan.
Italy
Monti calls for the markets to be patient and Italy to be ready to offer
Mario Monti, a future Italian Head of Government, has asked the markets for a little more time to create his staff and to implement a program that requires "supply" to restore the credibility lost during the last few months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held negotiations with the political parties before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his duty to appoint a cabinet in Parliament, which consists of a relatively strict combination of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, coordinator of one of the many parliamentary groups participating in the talks after he met with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had been hoping that Mario Monti would give Parliament a vote of confidence until Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The discussions will be held in the presentation of a list of complaints submitted by Mr Monti, which will reach a thousand ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that the strict nervousness of the pregnancy and obligation markets required their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines", to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed under the note that it was "sure that the markets would be displayed in a clear and sensible manner".
Its order was first confirmed by the markets, but the unrest had intensified, especially after an unexpected decline in industry in the euro area in September.
The prime minister in office is going to create an existing pillar of technology, although he stressed that he would also like to associate "political" with others.
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, which it estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should have the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti has been committed to working in all the urgency of the aim of making Italy "new protagonists" in Europe.
A speaker from EU Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy itself has not changed with regard to the new government".
The EU, which is convinced that Rome's goal of the same budget in 2013 will not be achieved despite the savings plans reached in recent months, has called for new heart attacks, in particular.
Emma Marcagglia, Head of the Chiefs" of Italy, which will be met on Monday, is also on the need for economic recovery", as a country which has no growth that cannot respect the definition figures."
M. Monti, known for his competence and his independence as the EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "Epochen exchange" in Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "reliability challenge" as well as a "other Italian" leading author.
The great stranger here enjoys the length of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent the proposed elections, as Italy has now reached 200 billion euro state obligations from April 2012.
Russian scientists help the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Wjatschelaw Danielenko, has helped Iran develop a nuclear-weapon-free explosives, thus confirming an American NGO specializing in nuclear threats on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report by the International Atomic Safety Agency AIEA and other documents issued by this UN Agency to identify this scientist.
Last week, the AIEA announced its "responsive care" on a possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to the ongoing study of the AIEA documents since the ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, has been working in a Soviet military nuclear power plant in Cheljabinsk (Ural), and has been involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by an explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he was to leave the centre to establish a company in Kiev, the "Nano diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him to contact the Iranian message in Ukraine in 1995.
Prior to his return to Russia, he worked on an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In her last report, the AIEA pointed out strong evidence that the Iranian development" of a nuclear explosive system" has been supported by the work of a foreign expert, who has not only been subjected to this technology, but also, as a Member of the Agency said, has worked on its entire professional career directly on this technology in the military nuclear power programme of its country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and deliberations have increased by 50%
The anti-Muslim crimes and deliberations have increased by 50% since 2009, although other racist or religious motivated violence according to the FBI statistics published on Monday have been easily recovered or only slightly recovered during the same period.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, thus increasing by 49%, despite a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% return to the Jews and a global increase of 14% to anti-religious crimes and punishments.
The total number of "hassed motivated crimes" has increased to 6.628 cases, including 47.3% by racial differences and 20% by religious differences of motivated punishments, according to the FBI.
"After a fall in 2009, it is thrilling to see these crimes and crimes again," stressed Human Rights First.The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had for a long time stressed that the violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," added Paul Legandre, a member of the organization.
"The American Government can and should do more to fight these attacks," he added, under the assumption that this could be done by improving the police's attitude towards "hashishing".
The "hasscriche" is a heritage in the U.S. federal law from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This law was adopted after the death of Martin Luther Kings to punish violent people who are directed against race, skin color, religion or ethnicity and who are now also involved in criminal acts of sexual intimacy.
Twitter translates the platform and looks more and more like Facebook
The Microblogging website Twitter introduced changes on Monday to the presentation of its platform in order to enable its users in particular to monitor the activities of those who follow their entries, what makes the service look like more of those on Facebook.
The new "Activity" tab and another"Name will enable you to better read live to complete the activities of other "Twitter", the Internet user whose messages ("Tweets") are followed and your messages are followed.
This enables them to find out whether they allow their messages to be followed, whether they subscribe to new contributions, to promote certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer was tested before its general internet distribution on Monday"in August at a low percentage of users", the Twitter speaker Carolyn Penner announced in front of the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive features, equipped with something esoteric animating Wordlaut (RT for the referenced re-trails of another person's behavior). followfreeday to recommend to follow another user) thus opening up a wider audience with a more comparable management to that of large public networks Facebook and Google+.
In the network, users discussed with the help of certain "Tweets" via the Internet about this innovation.
"This is useless, exciting and very similar to very Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The function "Activity" will help me to follow certain elements of my Flux Twitter better", quoted @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a Golden Rule of the Budget
On Tuesday, the Government of the Great Social Democratic/Christian Democratic Coalition in Austria decided to incorporate a "Golden Budget Rule" into the Constitution to reduce public deficits and to avoid any degradation by rating agencies in the Austrian Top Bond (AAA).
It was the social democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who had announced this decision at the beginning of the Council of Ministers, although the Austrian public debt was 74.6%, so much more than the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's payment capacity did not fall short of AAA's losses on AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros a year," argued Michael Spindeleger, Vize Chancellor and Christian Minister for Democracy.
Austria also requested the Brussels summit of the Member States of the Eurozone on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government would then have required the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 as well as a return to public accountability in the Constitution or through the adoption of a equivalent law.
This is similar to the "German model" taken by the Austrian Government, since Germany was the first European country to have adopted such a "rule" in the Constitution.
By 2017 the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (BIP) per year, and from 2017 the Federal State's structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, although the regional states should also show comparable households.
The aim is to cover the budget debt in the 2020/21 horizon under the 60% criteria set by the Maastricht Agreement.
Starker Yen
Noda comes with a new intervention on the currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese government would intervene again in the currency markets if Yen should continue to rise.
"If we should establish an excessive volatility" in the exchange course of Yen, we will also intervene as we have done the last time," M. Noda in the Senate explained.
On Tuesday the Yen was again speeded up to the historical level, which the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on 31 October.
On that day Tokyo sold massive yen against dollar to reduce the Japanese currency value, which has been a new record value since 1945 against the dollar.
However, the Yen has increased regularly, baptized by purchases of investors who see the Yen as "influential value" in these uncertain times of global economic collapse and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell under 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro is below the symbolic lot of 105 yen in the vicinity of the level that had reached the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar reported on the 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This Japanese device fires the exports of the Archipelago as it distorts the costs of "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn from Japanese companies from abroad as they exchange them in foreign currency.
"Japan fights after the earthquake and Tsunami on 11 March, which destroyed the Tohoku region (Northern East), for its reconstruction," said M. Noda, who fears that this terror of the Yen could already kill the weak rise in the universe.
The third economic world power has achieved growth in the third quarter of -1.5% compared to the previous quarter, for the first time this year thanks to the rapid export and consumption of the "plumbized" households in the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister appreciates that the tenure of Yen does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan".
On the other hand, Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, has opened a two-day meeting of her monetary policy committee on Tuesday, calling for all mental abuses to take place in order to eradicate the Yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, the Institute's Deputy Governor, has put in mind that BoJ has already introduced "qualified mavnas", which makes it possible to read that there is no additional money laundering to be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting, at the end of October, the notate bank had increased its state bonds to 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to reach the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) coverage amounts that it had set up for various purchases of financial securities in order to transfer the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Xinfins fast to the height, bows turn back
The risk of the debt crisis is constantly underestimated by the European figures.
Despite the adoption of the new heads of government in Greece and Italy as well as the best growth rates in France and Germany, the Councils of the weak countries continue to grow.
The seeds that are still concerned about the stability of the euro area are also running on this Tuesday, 15 November, a little more in negative fields.
In Paris, the CAC lost at 10 a.m. 1.4% and fell to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt returned to 0.4%, London to 0.1%.
"In view of the new efforts in terms of State loans' incomes in the euro area in difficulty, the global stock markets continue to deliver some of their short-term gains.
"The capitalists are nervous and only aware of the risk of arrest," says Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the press agency Reuters.
The difficulties in Tokyo, which, on the other hand, at the renewed fear of market participants regarding the capacity of Europe to continue the debt crisis, had resulted in a reduction of 0.7%.
"Japan has also directed its eyes to Europe as the rest of the world has, and the trade moves to a limited variation corridor, as long as the applicants have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This recurrence of concern over the future of the euro area damages the unit currency that continues to base on the service day.
The euro has been moving to its lowest level for a few months.
At 10 o'clock, the European currency was worth $1,3570, so it amounted to 0.4%.
According to the farmers, after the CDU, a party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered at the Congress on Monday, had filed an application, which, in particular, provides for the possibility of leaving the euro area without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are below 6%.
Italy and Spain continue to be at a very disturbing level.
This Tuesday morning, the Italian commitments reached 6.85%, which the Spanish title reached 6.2%.
These trends in interest rates in the South, but also in France, continue to undermine the fears of the employees.
The future Italian Head of Government Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by debt burden in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the market visir, as Parliament elections take place on Sunday.
The "spread" series between the German and Spanish 10-year obligations has already reached a new, historical height.
Expected growth figures in the euro area
Statistics show that France consumed an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter by the budget consumption, thus less than the expected 0.3%.
However, the statistical Federal Office of the InSEE had revised the lower figures of the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (BIP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter, which is the most encouraging of the experts.
Germany, on the other hand, had to record an increase of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate of the entire euro area will be expected at 11 hours, warning the EU Commission of the risk of a renewed recession.
Energy policy:
Facts about documents
If there is an issue that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term views or emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is wise to accept an election meeting to consider this subject and the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bring fruit if it ensures the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is beginning to double the demand for electricity by the year 2050, there is no need to forget a huge proportion of the world's population on a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to ease the linkage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce constant electricity without the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, one of the issues that has been eliminated from the ecological debate to combat climate irregularities.
The accident of Fukushima does not change this parameter.
Therefore, Germany continues to be isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is neither the case in Belgium, which undermines its decision of necessity to find a substitute source of replacement, nor in Switzerland, which is only intended to build nuclear power plants of the last generation.
United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few countries, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, on the other hand, has decided to join their park by re-entering the three Mile Island work after the atomic accident.
Even if it is based on renewable energy sources, the German model is sometimes used as a template, however, the reality of the talk is opposed.
The choice in Berlin will be in the form of a supply of electricity prices, an increased energy dependence on imports, in particular Russia, a rise in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal power plants.
The total of these adverse effects will already be observed within a few months.
The case of Denmark allows for reflection.
Denmark is one of the most powerful users of coal and gas, on the other hand, in terms of wind energy, and its CO2 emissions and electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the stability of our energy policy, our neighbors pay a 40% higher electricity bill compared to our French budget.
Since the energy price in the globalised economy represents a key role of competitiveness and a stable industry on a national basis, the French companies have benefited because of the most valuable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a strong increase in energy prices, which will be read in the original statements on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of the purchasing power to illusion.
Questionnaires found that it is a price that the vast majority of French people are willing to pay as little as they can resist the principle of this energy source.
At present, we believe that our country's energy policy has enabled us to build an industrial sector with 125.00 directly and 410,000 inspired jobs.
Because of its strong export characteristics, it brings a large number of specialised small and medium-sized enterprises into the international markets and makes them a creator of countless jobs.
Should France take the decision to withdraw from nuclear power, a large part of this SMEs would fall to the victim, and the annual 6 billion euros on energy and fuel exports would be more and more aggregate.
What electricity would be responsible for operating an EPR designed for sixty years if the decline of its producers is preprogrammed?
In order to solve the energy equation, one must realize that there is also little one like a devil's work to produce electricity.
The solutions developed by Areva, CO2 armaments for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy are evidence of the complementarity of energy sources.
The highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that has carried out uncompromised and transparent controls in existing works, such as construction in Flamanville.
Their working groups, which have made a name because of their professionality, have just been affected by the security proposal.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, and even in Three Mile Island, has been established under normal operating conditions; so he loved humans and the environment without consequences.
In Tschernobyl, the drama was challenged by reactor construction as well as innocent, human failure.
At Fukushima some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters has never been caused by a mass mass that has caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The core industry will also remove its teachings from this incident, as it had done after the two preceding events.
As a result of this approach, as well as cooperation between the safety authorities of French and German nuclear power plants and manufacturers, the EPR is a project that enables it to resist such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable under the electrotechniques to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a wonderful gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by reading them free railways to move to the leadership position in the independent nuclear power development.
It is impossible and legitimate to look for the best energy budget for our country, but it would be irresponsible to dominate a debate, which also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised in many contexts - overload of police, judicial and administrative bodies because of a number of policies, the compatibility of this policy with the status of a 'State of Human Rights', as France himself claimed.
Before long, the charges against foreign students had been imposed on the official side of the week, which the Minister of the Interior had announced (see libération of 23 May) that France "does not need talent, Maurer or Kellner from abroad".
But this policy was only rarely analysed by the economic perspective.
On this subject, there is a wide-ranging consensus between rights and links.
On the right hand side, the tone of Jacques Chirac, which in 1976 had stated that "950,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrants, should not have a problem for a country," by Michael Rocard, who had represented 1990, France "would not have taken over the whole world's poverty".
The only difference is in the degree of gravity
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by the order of Polish Klempner was shared in 2005 by both the right and the left.
The immigrants were taken from both camps as a burden to the economy and the French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of gravity that you want to be able to deal with immigrants.
Francois Hollande has limited its programme to bananas, which indicate that partnership development allows us to solve our migration problems.
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may affect the choices, but it is economically cost-effective.
As economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent work that combines the latest insights into immigration (Exclusive People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), there is a broader consensus among specialists on the positive impact of immigration flows on economic growth, wages and jobs in immigration countries.
Restricting immigration would increase growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears with respect to the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they are trying to replace local labour forces, in particular the less qualified ones, by exerting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are actually much more complementary than domestic wage workers, as they are heavily employed in sectors that are technically uncharged.
The low-qualified immigrants work in sectors where domestic wage workers are less qualified than immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not required to offer jobs.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthetics, this complementaryity also has a positive effect on immigrant employment and the domestic labour market.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in immigrant flows leads to a medium-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this does not take into account the fact that the diversity of ideas introduced by immigrants and economic growth is affordable (highly proportion of immigrants under American Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also contributing to the social systems in the European countries in the middle of about 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that a person aged 30 years after Germany makes a net contribution of around EUR 150,000 to the public budget over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to restore the missing cut points "with the teeth" to the entry of his mandate.
However, these infected figures, which should be withdrawn by immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has found democracy, now it remains to think of European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; it is also a sensitive good.
The European continent should be able to remember itself who, after their discovery in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had left behind the entire 20th century of the tragedy of the First World War, the Totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some may have believed that it is sufficient to exercise the right to vote, although in a direct way and in order to see democracy one for all time over their enemies.
Since Napoleon's "the little one", it has been a sign of spirituality.
The general right of choice, which represents the necessary condition of democracy, is not enough for this and can also be good for the "repudiation instrument" as expressed at the time by the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of violence, education, declaration, economic and social community spirit, a legal speech.
The crisis in Europe in which we are, is an economic crisis, but it is also a very and rather political and democratic crisis.
In this regard, the change in the opinion of the Greek true-Falsch referendum had twice been achievable: once the necessity of a strong return to politics, on the other hand also those of the disturbing feeling of their inability, of their incompatibility.
This ambivalentity should be considered as above.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have fallen today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer heading in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to push the success of the national referendum, which has been organised according to the needs and in traffic.
A fresco for the European rulers alone or a stream of connected eyes into the armies of the nationalist return: a great choice for the citizens!
No, we want hacking, but a collective task, in full law, clear and steady, a elections and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you know where to end the census - because there is only one crisis, and this is ruling in Europe.
It is all Europe, which advocates the dictatorship of the markets and the rating agencies, which is under its control and its lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe, which is internationally detached.
One is concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - in this case it is all Europe, which is likely to lose its sovereignty, and that is why each of the nations associated with it.
The urgency is to give the peoples' unity the leadership of the European project back to hand.
Because it is common for Europeans to reduce their debt, free themselves from markets, and to start a future through investment.
The rise from the crisis has taken decisions at European level on conditions that cannot be achieved without the total democratic legitimacy without necessarily leading us to disappointment.
Following this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists for a long time, everyone today is forced by the European economy.
Understanding.
But without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it presupposes citizens - it would be a new turnaround and a more suffocation.
We need to take a new step on European construction.
In order to allow the Republic to exist in France, the fact that Republicans had to "create".
The revolution of interests alone could not afford enough here.
This amendment remains valid.
We need to form a better integrated Europe at an economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically seen democratic Europe, a genuine European unity of peoples.
We need Europe to create Europe.
"Contactless" chipmaps are generally available
The world fair for chip maps opens on Tuesday in Villapinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude to its tower.
According to Eurosmart, the year 2011 is expected to end with a 11% increase in global sales of micro-processorchips (EC cards, SIM cards) with more than 6 billion units sold.
The leading segment is the contactless technology that enables payments in public transport or comparison of purchases by simply holding the card on a reading device.
In contrast to the 320 million sold last year, 460 million free chips should be sold worldwide this year!
Their market share should continue in 2012 (580 million units expected) and more than 10% of the global chipmap market (6,925 million maps).
Europe will gain in terms of the free payment of land after the long-term decline in the Asian Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals are accepted.
In France, the beginnings have been more successful: only 400,000 free visas have been distributed.
The consumer markets, however, make a fuss.
Carrefour has thus issued 2.5 million wireless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to survive at a higher rate, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions have committed themselves to handing out their customers in future systematic banking cards which are connected with a wireless chip," says Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Bank test payment by phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to the means of payment for the future: mobile phone.
A declining percentage of devices is thus far equipped with the necessary NFC technology (Near Field Communication) to carry out these transactions.
"They've been betrayed."
"But at least next year they should experience real progress."
"We're counting in 2012 on the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide," says Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks have an initiative.
The Crédit Agricole had announced the start of a test race in Cain yesterday, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees should be equipped with a capsule that allows for free payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Generale had said yesterday to prepare for the introduction of a offer that enables its customers to pay without contact by telephone.
Terrorist front is understood to be from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relationship between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram section.
The already suspected relations between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian section Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algeria has now "come to know" about it.
"The way in which the two organizations proceed, as well as the relations of the secret services, are involved in a clear cooperation," he explained without adding any further details.
Paris seems to do a similar analysis.
The findings on the conduct of two French entrants in Niger, last January, have encouraged border crossings on days.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey, should have been killed on the following day as several of their drivers were killed during an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators wanted to find several telephone chips that belonged to terrorists in the drummers.
Terrorism
The analysis of the telephone calls conducted leads to several speakers who are stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the number of two chat partners: A number leads to a Nigerian who has been in Maiduguri for a long time, a city in northern Nigeria, the village of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is closer to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, however, but you have to wait for more specific positions before you can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"But it's possible."
"I have known for years that the sections relate to the financial and intellectual support of Auben and that it is increasingly active," laments Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these "support services" have become more and more timely in their course, as well as the demands and operating modes of Boko Harem, which now refer to the use of self-mortem agents and the use of increasingly complex explosives that carry the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
Since then, the international community has put pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have, in fact, long considered the grouping to be a community of illuminators, which should not be given special attention.
Faster Success
The Boko Haram, founded in Maiduguri in 2002 in the context of a mosque, a school, and fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which in Haoussa means as much as "the Western education is a shame" - follows the creation of an Islamic emirat in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this medium-sized region, the association is making rapid progress.
It politicalizes and demands strict compliance with the Scharia, while its members are involved in the fight against the ungodly central government.
The activists first have churches, bars and authorities in the audience.
In 2009, activists from Boko Haram showed their increased attacks on the Commission especially active.
However, the reaction of Abuja is usually ignored.
The army surrounds the city, counting 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was arrested in prison, was killed in prison.
As a result, the sections are radically radical and leave their peaks in the north.
Last Christmas she became known for an attention in Jos, who demanded 80 people's lives, thus another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram will be assigned the debt of a suicide victim, who has arrived at the safe police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the United Nations's local seat is set for the priority international targets.
The formation of a terrorist in Africa, which is to lead from Mauritania across Nigeria to Somalia, has since been encouraged by all security experts.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger have managed to operate the Somalis of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé warned President Good luck Jonathan in Nigeria in front of Boko Harem and showed himself to be "noticeful".
The World of Republican Presidential Candidates
With Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry, they revaliate in simplification and ignorance regarding China, Iraq and Israel's assistance.
Can a crisis-fashioned America have a complex world with simple not to say: lead decent ideas?
If this is the case with the Republican presidential candidates, the voters could almost get this impression.
For a few days, helmney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their co-founders have been re-enacting their donor statements as well as their statements regarding Auben policy, the traditional republican focus.
On China, Iran and Israel's aid fall - often in no way underestimated - Slogans.
With regard to the designation of the "Grand Old Party" at the highest rate in the Middle East, the Chinese were reluctant to quote the WTO and they were the leading issue of "money manipulation" in an America that, through the ambiguation of all industrial sectors to Asia, was to be taken into account.
He said that if this was to imply the introduction of a war of commerce, he would run.
Jon Huntsman, former messenger in China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have an excellent vision of foreign policy, has narrowed the air almost with regard to his squeezing emotions.
He called for a firm but constructive exchange of talks with Beijing (also the current attitude of Obama).
But Huntsman will not be heard because he pauses at the depth of the questions.
Reagan's Image
Romney also believed military attacks against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear programme were to be dropped.
"If I were to be elected, I would go to Iran's content," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they get the bombs."
In addition, he promised to strengthen Israel's military assistance and accused Obama of remaining a partner against obligations.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the highest-ranked candidate, is, on the other hand, taking a keen knowledge of the action.
He recently called for the Chinese military threat to be countered by Beijing's "test to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to be too interested in the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
The Technical Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and demands military attacks on Iran, is on his side, on the other hand, ready to take up the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The response of Obama 2009 to tortures against mutant terrorists was also rejected by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
It is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an extrapolitical weight.
In contrast to the current presidential opponents, Reagan also had simple ideas and, nevertheless, won the Cold War.
They call to mind that Obama also had to be an amateur himself and give water in his wine what the theme of anti-terror was about.
They need the right to follow his unambiguous conversation with Iran, the previous withdrawal of his "boy" from Iraq, his independence in Libya, which also brought him the call of weakness.
However, this attack is not so severe.
The population further appreciates the positive balance of national security under Obama, which has turned Bin Laden off.
Since Iraq, they have faced military intervention leading to relief.
And Obama is surprised by his argument that America needs to be economically restored in order to develop its leadership position in a new life.
North Stream, new door to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which runs along the coast of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly to Russia, was launched.
You are going to deliver gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas station Gazprom wanted to see this event with glaz and Gloria.
Over 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, have spent their last day at the Ossetian coast under orchestralization and at the Feinschmecker buffet of the introduction of the new North Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea mirror.
The German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon, and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands, have, in a symbolic way, managed to bring the tax of the Ventilus together, which has contributed to the Russian gas to the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year are to be delivered to Western Europe by the first railway line of 1.224 km connecting the Sankt Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline that allows a total delivery of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - is to be completed by the end of 2012.
And you can already attach the possibility of building a third direction to the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely and accurate completion of this huge construction works is a victory.
The project was strongly disputed in Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream Pipeline will allow direct gas supply to Germany, and in the absence of any transit passage through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the road.
For this reason, these two countries lose little power: it is now harder for them to exert pressure on Russia by trying to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, the most strongly engaged in the debate, was not expected to compare the North Stream Pipeline with a "new German-Swedish Pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purposes of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the political issue is too sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply through the promotion of these Russian projects.
However, this is at the expense of a recovery of European energy because the project has caused a gap between Western and Eastern Europe.
In almost five years Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries with strong gas consumption and their gas supply to be re-examined.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new arterial that connects us organically and in a way," confirmed François Fillon in the introduction of the gas pipeline, pointing out how important the major gas contracts are also on the political and economic side.
All of this explains the wide range of gasprom managers represented in Lubmin with regard to gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an excellent technique.
The waterway consists of steel with concrete assembly to protect them from ship sinks.
It runs on the seabed, about 200 m deep.
In its construction, mine fields dating from the Second World War had to be removed.
"About a hundred mines had to be removed or destroyed," said Jens Müller, speaker of the company Nord Stream.
In addition, enhanced mavnage to protect the Fauna and Flora had to be taken.
The lead is a long metal blade, heavy like 242 eiffel towers, which is not broken over the whole length by nothing: either by valves or maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned at the coast of Sweden, but the project officials took away because the Swedes were not too keen to see a Russian state company in a permanent way and at the height of their coast.
"In the event of an accident, we close the gas pipeline in less than a minute," preciseed Jens Müller.
In the case of a leck, that is why the gas in the gas pipeline is in the air.
However, this case is considered less likely by the designers, since the Swiss bond was estimated at a strength of 100,000 years.
The state surveillance of the gas pipeline is provided both by a underwater robot, which is controlled for external observation purposes by a ship, and also by a device which is circled within the gas pipeline.
It owns the shape of a cigarette, with a diameter of a meter, is introduced into the pipe guide and is moved by gas pressure.
After three full days of movement by driving at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides accurate information on any deformation of the metal when it arrives.
The gas pipeline has been designed to function for five years without having to be subjected to the minimum repair.
The gas circulation is simply guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the access point, 100 bar at the exit.
Five companies have combined their forces to implement these projects.
However, guidance remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
The German companies E. ON and BASF (i.e. 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunia and the French company GDF Suez (i.e. 9%).
These five companies have formed a company called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
She has her seat in train in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly valuable.
Gazprom has thus denied the entire capacity of its gas transport company, and in spite of the extended Zwanzig-year contract.
"Gazprom will be paid for the total capacity, regardless of how gross the actual transport of gas falls," said Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas pipeline was secured by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should amount to EUR 7.4 billion for both routes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amount was 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are reluctant to re-introduce their exhibits, as Gazprom alone carries the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline is located in a sandy coastal coastal strip that has been operated by Kiefern from the Ossetian.
The 4.5 meters high ventiles form the gas-strips.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other figures of the gas in question before it is transmitted into the German gas pipelines.
Since the last Tuesday this terminal is delivered with a million cubic metres of Russian gas per hour.
With full capacity this would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand note book.
From an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give the letter a new style.
It has a flair of adventures, which has been written for hours at church scene.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognizable, with its black, legal connection, its rubber band, the iron-coloured pages, as it is changed over time.
The Moleskine Notebook, as it is known today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, whose seat is in Milan, decided to bring a distinguished design book to the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then the company's professional consultant, is responsible for the introduction of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old-born production technique called Mole Skin (maulwurfshaut), which is called a cotton jacket, which is used for example for the purposes of polyester banks.
This type of notebook was asked very much by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has relived an old and almost forgotten object, which has been regarded as an icon of avant-gardisic artists by the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now responsible for fashion Mode.
It's a success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 26% and grew by 12.7 million pieces.
This is far from the usual production of the first year, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is carried out in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to produce a phantom image of the buyer, as the note is also inspired by business people as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open customers.
The small Italian company, which numbered 12 employees in its beginnings, employs over 100 employees today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company sells its note books in books, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small botiques of the city centre and understands its identity.
"We have followed the spirit of the day and its new need for writing, which exists despite the rising of the e-mail," Maria Sebregondi explained.
This cultural attraction is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: recently the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour (Umbeg) " in the architects and artists displayed their own notebooks.
In August, the company, on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno, also made a connection with Leoparden's model on the market.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural spirit and understood how to diversify his products: bags, calendars, fillings, computers... The brand shows the entire range of articles.
A success that brings new ones to the plan: In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the Investment Fund SG Capital Europe, which is today’s syntegra Capital, thus opening up a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine.
Why do unemployment rates remain at such high levels?
About 19% of the disabled are looking for a job.
Today the "15th week of work for disabled people" begins.
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, unemployment rates in disabled persons are always doubled as high as the average value: 19% against 9% of total unemployment.
Disgusting?
"No, this is how Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Association, stresses the "Work Week for Disabled."
"The progress made within fifty years is significant."
"The unemployment rate was not doubled at the time, but three times that high."
"There's still a lot to do."
However, it has to be said that there are still many obstacles to employment for disabled persons before they get a job.
It is more common for older people: 37% are older than 50 years (17% in average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a Abitur and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with higher education outcomes.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% in the disabled compared to 38% in the overall.
In the short run, there are so many criteria that a new job increase is difficult to achieve, and that constitute the "cores of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a association founded in 1992 that helps companies.
So much for the professional brakes.
The unexplained language, the spirit of truth, remains, but slowly develops.
A study conducted in April by IMS entrepreneurs for La Cité magazine, which the asked managers have "a weak level of knowledge about disabled persons", the "represented" is "by people in wheelchairs, mental or intellectual minorities".
As a result, the private companies, with more than 20 employees, have a long way ahead of themselves to achieve the employment target of 6% of the employees who have been prevented by an Act of 1987.
These figures, starting in 2008, refer to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at around 3%," reports Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organization responsible for doing this, to transfer contributions from companies that have failed to this law.
The evidence: The number of "taxable taxes" has decreased as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011 has decreased from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which foresees increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on companies," said Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also brings real recognition, especially in the major corporate groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the jobs of 20 and 49 employees are employed, with 100 to 199 employees, 82%.
Hazard: "What for happiness?"
Already before the "Blue Service" (20:45 am) the stars had their delight in Eden Hazard and George's Leekens, which brought them the game of friendship.
It would be too far to say that there was a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic bands.
On the side of the tour podium of the city de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard would have had a good and pleasant ending of peace.
Five months after the warm gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national trainer had nothing to do with his person as a compliment.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgium."
"I want to look forward," the jealous Liller assures her side.
What is the contrast between his performance in Club and National Self "It's a unit that justifies everything."
"In Little I've been over all year what's not happening in Belgium."
"It's time for me to go to the start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, led freehand against Romania with regard to the match against France, to finally "fly".
However, without leaving the note of "dependence".
From the age of seven years, the French National Union has been on fire, leading its successful fields between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This makes it difficult to strengthen the "uncertain" character of this encounter.
So many in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Johan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he adds.
"We just walked over the road."
"If they can play, that means great happiness!"
Leekens, on the other hand, read "stolz" with kindness.
"The Stolz, a Galamatch."
"Stolz" also means - in his capacity as "neighbor" - to confirm that France has again become a man at a very high level" and that less than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has read damn good work," he longed.
Although Belgium is missing in the next European empire, the technician looks very likely to share the aircraft with the blues (the French national aid) ... and towards Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come to the grave out," he insisted.
"We're planning a thing, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"They will notice this in the previous games." The game is against France.
Portugal very likely
The Portuguese men of Paulo Bento see with great optimism the return to Bosnia (22:00) this day of service in Lisbon.
In the game, the two men had failed.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy man and above all a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that "La Selecçao", his national staff, which he has been responsible for since September 2010, will qualify for the European Mastership 2012.
For Portugal, this means in fact only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and to serve a opponent, and about Bosnia.
In view of the game (0-0) on Friday in the cave of Zenica it seems clear that the holes have not fallen yet.
Portugal dominated the party for more than an hour, but the man was not able to express the important stamp that had taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, however, which results in a certain risk, because we have not reached a threshold."
However, in her bright town de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they should be in front of a audience who should also have been on the game, even if the party was declared "very quick", the optimistic but clear Bento said.
"We expect a very short match, but we are absolutely convinced that the upper hand can be won," explained the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have a 50% chance at the 2012 European Championship," said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The difference on Friday in Bosnia forced the Portuguese to reach and win a tower.
A difference can be enough for Bosnians who also need a tower.
"This is a good result, however, which results in a certain risk, as we have not achieved a challenge," laments Bento.
"We're going to be against a man who has high technical qualities and has a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese had already put maximum pressure on Bosnia at the beginning to "give them no time to think."
A good idea, under the condition that it will be implemented this time.
