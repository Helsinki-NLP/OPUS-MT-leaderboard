It uses satellite technology, rather than an earlier ground radar technology, so that air traffic controllers can better identify aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no additional transport, underground trains will not go to Wembley, and car parking and "construction and drive" services will not be provided.
The fear of lack of transport led to a consideration of the possibility that the trailers could be played for closed doors without command belts.
On Thursday, the survey published in Science reported on a new species of birds in the islands of Ecuador Galapas.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and the University of Upsalas in Sweden reported that the new species had developed only twice, although it was thought that this process would end much longer due to the discovery of the endometrial average farm (Geospiza fortes) and the migration of the large catalytic farm (Geospiza conirostris).
The gold can be formed in the most diverse forms. It can be sold in smaller forms.
It is possible to make a flat body that can be crushed or crushed. It is possible to wash or drink leaves.
It can be made of a very large sheet and attached to another metal. It can be such a sheet that it has sometimes been used to shake the hands of the printed images in a book called "smoothing scrolls".
This is called the pH of the chemical. Indicators can be derived from red-rolled juices.
The colour of the copper juices shows the amount of acid or basic (sparing) substance.
The pH level shall be indicated by the amount of ions of hydrogen (H produced in the pH) in the test chemical.
Water ions are the protons from which their electrons are removed (a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix both types of powder, then put them into the oven with clean clean hands.
The softness of your hands will respond to the external layers that are not very clean and will create a certain protective environment.
In the cities of Harapo and Mohendjo Dar, almost every house had a toilet with depleted water, connected to a powerful waste system.
The survivors of the exit systems were found in the cities of Mino civilisation in Crete and the Santorinian Islands in Greece.
The toilets were already ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, the toilets were sometimes part of the public gate where men and women were together in mixed company.

Another group is medium-sized cats eating the average-size grave from truffles to antelopes and eels.
And the last is small cats (including free pet cats) that eat a lot more diverse grave, such as wolves, pigs, pigs and birds.
Their secret of success is the proper understanding of the place – a special task to be performed by each casino and which does not allow him to compete with others.
The Soviets are the most social cat, living in large groups called the stars.
It consists of one to three generations of adults and up to thirty grandchildren and adolescents.
The courtyards are usually closely related to each other – as a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lithium beads act similar to wolves or dogs (very to lions, but not to other cats, similar animals) and are also improbable to their grave.
The tiger, an anterior animal, pays for digging (nos not ideal), swimming, can take away further distances and has five times the power of train than a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jagours. Only these four cats can grow.
Tigro's smell is not equal to the harsh smell of the bed. It's similar to the sound of the shout.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If you can, they will have animals, animals, vegetables and birds. Almost all ocelots that are forested are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that the ocelotate animals used to collect (grape) are followed and found in a cave, carrying the ground where they were.
They are very well seen in the dark, because they have the ability to see the night, and they move very slowly. Ocelots forest their grave, join with the environment, then melting it.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) are separated from the main population that belonged to them (e.g. a few mountain weights, crossing the river or moving to a new island and cannot easily return), it is often in the environment that differs from the one in which they once lived.
In this new environment, there are other resources and competitors, so that the new population will be more competitive, it will need other characteristics or changes than before.
The original population has not changed completely, and they still need the same adjustment.
In time, the new population began to adapt to the new environment, and it began to appear less like other populations.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, two populations will appear to be so different that they cannot be classified as the same species.
We call this process the formation of new species. The formation of new species is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce a deguy that breathes people, and it is part of the carbon dioxide that people smell.
The plants match food from the sun through the process of photosynthesis, and they also provide guidance.
We plant our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Many food products that we eat are plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Moses was the ultimate pillar of his day, that is, he was not afraid of anything but the rest of the Mosaic Law.

On the other side of the Declaration of Independence was the entry "The Original Declaration of Independence signed on 4 July 1776." The text is translated under the document.
Although no one knows exactly what this has been written, it is known that at the beginning of the existence of this large transfer document (its size is 29.75 x 24.5 Col.) has been stored.
Therefore, this note is likely to have been written just as a name.
The day D was released in the days of the eviction and further events in northern France, but half of it was still occupied.
This part was ruled by the French "Vichy" who met in 1940 with Germans and worked together in the fight against the inquisitives.

Within two weeks, the US and the French Free Power were able to release France's southern part and reach Germany.
Civilization is a particular culture, a form of a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The term civilisation comes from the Latin word "civil", which means civil, is related to a Latin "civis", a citizen, and a "civitas", which means a city or city-state, and also defines the size of the community.
Cities-states are the first of the nations. Civilization culture means the transfer of knowledge from one time to the next, the continuing cultural legacy and an unprecedented spread.
Small cultures are not rarely reported without important historical evidence and are not recognised by certain civilizations.
In the course of the revolutionary war, three countries initially formed a weak central government (which was the only part of Congress) on the basis of articles of the Confederation.
The Congress lacked the power to regulate taxes, and since there was no national executive authority or judicial system, it entrusted it to the State authorities who, in carrying out all their actions, had been largely uncooperative.
It also did not have the authority to impose tax laws and tariffs between States.
In order to change the articles, it was necessary to agree only with all the States, and the central government was so unwarranted that their representatives often did not participate.

For a group of islands / islands in Japan, it is often referred to as "land" in geographical terms.
Taiwan was discovered in the 15th century when European sailors visited it and called it Ilha Formosa, which means "great island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India established a base in southern Taiwan, starting to transform the Chinese grain production practice and to employ Chinese workers working on its rice and sugar plantations.
The power of the Chinese dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the west and north coast of Taiwan in 1683 and the province of the Chinese Empire was published in 1885.
In 1895 after the defeat of the first Chinese-Japan War (1894-1895), the Government of China signed the Shimonesaki Treaty, which passes through Taiwan to Japan, the largest island until 1945.
Maccu Pikç consists of 3 main structures: Intihuatana, the temple of the Sun and the Trij windows.
Many of the complex buildings in the inscriptions have been found to make the tourists better aware of how they initially appeared.
Up to 1976, 30 per cent of Macu Piccu was restored. The restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the world's most popular photo photography format is 35 mm. This frame size dominated the final wave of analog grids.
It is still being developed today, but more importantly, it has taken over the format of digital camera sensors.
35 mm format name is wrong, it is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
It is therefore said that the ratio of this format (parts of twelve to obtain the least healthy ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS format family) are equivalent or very close to this image format.
Often too much use and self-restraint is a simple guide, which creates dynamicity and maintains a few procedures.
It argues that the most effective location of the main object is the line that divides the image into three thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During that period of European history, the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, drew a lot of attention.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has been associated with the European States, despite language and common language differences.
They all had the power to influence everyone — from kings to ordinary people.
One of the fundamental principles of Christianity says that wealth should be used to reduce suffering and poverty and that church funerals are intended for that purpose.
The central church government had settled in Rome for more than a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and money forced many to question whether such doctrines were respected.
Shortly after such aggression, Britain launched a German maritime blockade.
The strategy has proved to be effective by eliminating the supply of vital military and civilian stocks, although this block violates the universally accepted international law provided by several international agreements concluded over the past two centuries.
Great Britain has prepared international waters to prevent ships from entering any part of the water and to risk not even ineffective State vessels.
In view of the weak response to tactics, Germany believed in a similar response to its unwarranted war of submarines.
In the 20th century, most people and survivors of the pacifism and insulation of the people will live.
In view of the darkness and darkness of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.

He came to the United States with 4 cents, poetry book, and Charles Batchler (his former employer) recommendation for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of revealing different periods; every stage of China or every family in the government had its own dynasty.
In addition, the inter-divisional period for the provinces was a period of instability. The most known period is the period of the Three Kings period, which lasted 60 years between Han and Jin.
During these times, wars have taken place between the great crowd, who have fought for the sake of the flag.
Three kingdoms were one of the most cruel times in the history of ancient China when thousands of people were killed fighting for the right to return to the capital of Siane's capital.

The same bird, who survived the trials of the year, gives a vivid picture of the spiritual sons of Mohammed.
Urva was on one of the mountains in the north of Mecca, so it was completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Even if you know that the storm is, finding it is not easy. When you get into the storm, you are completely isolated.

The largest pyramid in Gizo is the only of seven world wonders that is still enduring.
The great pyramid, built by the Egyptians III B.C.E., is one of many large pyramids built in the glory of the dead Pharaoh.
There are a number of pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), a few small caps, shrines, and a Great Sphinx in Egypt.

The Brandian averages are the period between early and late averages. It is generally thought that the last ended about 1500 years.
Technological determinism is a term covering various practical ideas – from technological progress or need to a certain extent, that man’s survival is determined by internal logic related to science and its phenomenon in technologies.
Most of the interpretations of technological determinism have two common ideas: that the development of technology itself is a step that is essentially a cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has a "effect" for a natural society, not depending on social conditions.
For example, someone can say that a car will need direct roads.
However, the national road network is not economically viable if it will benefit only a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce car ownership costs.
As a result of heavy traffic, accidents are increasing, and this contributes to the treatment of new health care systems.
Romanticism is a very cultural determinant, taken from writers such as Gėtė, Fichtė and Šlègelis.

As Paris is now known as the capital of modern times, Constantinople has been regarded as the capital of the Faodal European model.
He wept as an epicenter about 400 C.E. after Christ and continued until about 1100 C.E.
In the 12th century, his status was greatly reduced by the return of cruisers to gifts such as coal and copper that were valued more than what the Byzantine market had proposed.
At the time, the title of the model was taken from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style increased between the ages of X-XI and XIV.
At first, the culture of Byzantine culture had a profound impact on the east.
However, due to slow communication, the styles sometimes reached the evening after 25-30 years.
Finally, the Middle Ages in Western Europe began to create its own style. One of the most important changes that have occurred due to cross-border brands is that people have started to wear clothes.
The natural agricultural sector is a agriculture that is carried out to raise sufficient food to meet only the needs of agriculture and its family.
Natural farming is a simple, often ecological system in which local ecorgy seeds are used and are applied to seed or other very simple methods of increasing productivity.
The historical majority of farmers engaged in natural farming, and in many developing countries, there is a growing trend.
Subculture unites thinking people who feel uncomfortable with public standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may vary by age, ethnic origin, class, location and/or sex.
Properties describing subculture as a weekly may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or physical combinations.
Subcultural members often express their membership in themselves and figuratively using styles, including hair, manner and beard.
One of the most popular ways of showing socialization is to take several examples of failure children who have not been socialized by adult prevalence or maternal abuse.
Such children are referred to as “unregulated” or wild. Some children have been separated from society’s people (usually their own parents); when these children were rejected because parents did not recognize a difficult child’s intellectual or physical disorder.
Adults may experience a great deal of violence or tragedy before they leave or when they leave.
Others are claimed to be animals; some live on their own.
If a child is not raised by a human being, he behaves (at physical options) almost as well as the animals that care for him, such as the fear of humans or ignores them.
While project training should facilitate learning and make it more interesting, it is even more beneficial to study.
There is no teaching method, and help people learn something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The meals can also be virtual, and the actuals, in other words, the teacher is like a meal, but the same can be said about the Microsoft Office.
Virtual meals are included in the software and are designed to consider, encourage and explain the student’s difficult procedures that he cannot handle alone.
Children are at home for a variety of reasons: from neglect to violence and even abuse.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not refreshing, caring, and refreshing, but that is the way it is.
We believe that the refugee system for these children is a central security area.
Our system of funerals must provide safe homes, loving funerals, stable education and reliable health care.
The clubs should give the child everything he misses in the homes he has taken from.
The Internet combines the elements of mass and intermediation communication.
The exclusive properties of the Internet determine the development of additional dimensions in relation to the use and fulfilment of desires.
For example, "learning" and "socialisation" are offered as an important motivation for Internet use (James and etc., 1995).
J. Eichmee and L. McCord (1998), examining audit responses to the Internet site, also identified new motivational aspects – "personal participation" and "continual relations".
Using the video records, the important findings were made by explaining the expression of the face turning in a few milliseconds, the face movement.
In particular, it is argued that it is possible to determine whether a person is a melancholy by correctly explaining micro-organisms.
In his work "President's language" Oliver Sacks says that people who cannot understand language because of brain damage have a great sense of identity.
He even claims that such an ability to understand human behavior can also be possessed by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Twenty-year-old studies have shown that there are two types of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation and the selection removes it from the joint sample of the said variations.
Segregation and recombination determine the mixing of options in two groups each time.
In the wild, it is difficult to satisfy the needs of amino acids from available plant sources.
Such a lack has serious consequences: slowing down, losing food and finally dying.
The most readily accessible sources of protein would be plant leaves and fronts, but for such primates as we are hard to overcome without value.
On the other hand, food from animal origin (screws, thermals, eggs) is not only easily exceeded, but gives many proteins containing all essential amino acids.
In view of all of this, you should not be surprised that our intellectuals have dealt with the "best problem" almost the same way as today's chimpanzee.
Sleep interruption is an appropriate start during sleep and sleep after a short period of 10 to 60 minutes.
This can be done easily by using a relatively slow pusher that will restore your consciousness without fully promising you.
If you are sleeping on the floor of your bedroom, you can help it out on the other side of the room, so that you need to get out of bed if you want to.
Another option based on biolittism is the flow of fresh liquids (especially water or food, known diuretics) before sleep, as it will lead to a break in the sleeper.
The amount of inner peace that man has is proportional to the amount of tension in his body and spirit.
The less impressed, the more you trust yourself and feel alive. Each person can find complete satisfaction and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve elimination. The only obstacle that does not allow you to achieve this goal is your pressure and disability.
Tibetan Buddhism was based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was extended through the love of bread and many methods of Indian yoga.
In fact, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini juga, meditation and all the ways of love.

This has continued for 40 years and has actually been fought with mining soldiers from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, Poland’s defence was already successful, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize the beginning of Romania’s siege.
However, these plans went into effect almost overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Cross soldiers entered the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Russian Peace Treaty, the Soviets and the Polish Non-Proliferation Treaty and other bilateral and multilateral treaties created the Belarus and Ukraine fronts.
The use of ships for transporting goods so far is the most effective way to catch large quantities of people and goods across the water.
Traditionally, the work of the military forces of the sea was to ensure the movement of people and goods in your country and not allow the enemy to transfer their people and goods.
One of the most significant examples in recent years was the Second World War campaign in North Atlantic. The Americans tried to overcome war and materials that helped Britain.
At the same time, Germany’s military ship, mostly using submarines, tried to stop the acquisition of these goods.
If the allies were to lose, Germany would probably be able to defeat Britain as the rest of Europe.

A geleginkelis was born in England at the age of 16.
Although transport routes were made only of the equivalentd wooden planes, they allowed passengers to do so faster and could be hauled larger goods than those at the same time.
Flights were created very early in order to confirm flights. However, it gradually became apparent that the flights were more effective if they were hit by metal.
This became a common practice, but the rail increased the speeds of the wooden wagons.
Finally, the media changed rails. In 1767 the first total rails were provided.
The first known way of travel was to travel. People started walking straight two million years ago, when Homo Erectus (this is a standing man).
They are primarily australopitics, not always running.
The adaptation of two legs is seen in the 4,2 to 3.9 million years of age in australopitic fossils, but Sahelanthropus may have been able to move in two legs seven million years ago.
We can begin to live less harming the environment, join the movement of the environment, and even be active in order to reduce the likelihood of suffering in the future.
In many cases, this is similar to symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to find and remove the causes of problems.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed strongly because of human scientific and technological achievements, and the problem is growing as a result of the population's overarching and extravagance of life.
After the convention on 4 July, a letter written by John Henkokas and Secretary Charles Tomson was sent to the John Danlapa print room in several quarters.
At night, 150 to 200 copies were produced, now known as Dunlapa Airports.
For the first time, the document was read publicly by John Nixon on July 8th of the island of Independence.
One such document was sent to George Washington on July 6th, which read it to his soldiers in New York on July 9th. A copy of the document arrived in London on August 10th.
Twenty-five copies of Dunlapo still exist, which are known to be the oldest remaining copies of the document. The original copy of the written hand has not survived.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survives and survives. We call them birds.

In principle, all computers used today are actions with information prohibited in the form of double numbers.
The binary number has only one of the two values, which is 0 or 1. These numbers are called double digits, or by means of a computerized range.
Its symptoms, such as vomiting, are very common, so it may not be possible to detect diagnosis immediately.
The most clear indicator of internal exposure is the open range of medicinal products or toxic chemicals.
In the label, you will find the first instructions for the first aid.
The entomologists referred to in this group are formally using the term ‘black’.

The main objective of science is to explain the existence of the world and its aspects by using a scientific method, which is, in fact, the most important of many research.
However, this is not the only thing: the experiment is a test used to remove one or more possible hypotheses by asking questions, and monitoring also helps to direct research.
Natural explorers and philosophers have given much attention to classical texts, especially Latin Bibles.
Aristotle’s views spread throughout the realm of science, including psychology.
Iraq's Abu Ghrabo prison was under siege.
The majority of observed physiological and behavioural rhythms are often highly dependent on the presence and formation of endogenous cycles in biological journals.
It has been observed that the periodic repeat cycles, which are not a response to repeated external surgeons, have a majority of living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clocks are self-generating generators that maintain cyclicity even without external signs.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the most important to prove that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used a class, or viruses to implant their DNA into the bacteria.
They performed two experiments with fage DNR by marking radioactive phosphorous or fago protein – radioactive serum.
mutations may have many different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the genetic part of the substance affected and whether the cells are Gemal cells.
Only a cell mutation at a gemal level may be transmitted to the offspring, while other mutations may cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people who want to visit the natural areas in order to corrupt images, including gardening of plants and animals.
The activities offered at the site include forestry, fishing, photography, bird monitoring, park visits and ecosystem study.
The example is an orangutan visit, photographing and learning about them from Borneo.
Every morning people get out of small towns to go to their place of work, while others who have their place of work are found in the area where the first thing is left.
In this dynamic road vehicle system, everyone is involved and supports the vehicle system based on private cars.
According to science, this large-scale carbon economy has damaged the stability of bioosphere, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, complaints about the quality of water or the noise of pollutants are rarely heard.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they have problems every day? Are transport engineers simply not competent, or is the problem more fundamental?
The traffic flow is a science of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to examine traffic flows because it is not possible to provide for drivers’ behaviour by a percentage objective.
It is good for drivers to behave fairly uniformly, so traffic flows usually have a certain degree of consistency and can be calculated mathematically.
To improve the transmission of traffic, three key characteristics have been identified: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relations help to plan, design and operate road infrastructure.
The animals were the first animals to come into the air, their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies and to find food and friends more effectively.
The advantage of many bees is that they can fly back to their body long enough.
This allows them to hide from the depths in many small places.
Today, the only bees that can't break their spinal cord are the laurels and the lavender.
A thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the sun is moving around Saul.

People have long recognized basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, copper, copper, because they can be found in their natural form and easily read them in primary tools.
Aristotle, philosopher, taught that everything is made of one or four elements. They were land, water, air and fire.
It was more similar to the four bodies of matter (in the same way): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although it also developed the theory that they are based on new substances that make what we see.
There are essentially two or more metal mixtures. Remember, there are many elements in the periodic table.
Such elements as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals – silver, gold.
You can also have low-metal elements, e.g. english wires.
Everything is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
The atoms are unlikely to reach the point at the end of this sentence.
Thus, a good friend of many people was shown by the stick that proved to be a fine neighbor.
Unfortunately, as a result of the latest writing methods, the status of the press has decreased and the volume of its use has decreased.
Now people are familiar with the computer screens and they never need to look for a dormitory.

The surface of the moon consists of stones and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the flat.
The platform is about 70 km in length and 100 km in length.
It's hotter than the moon, and larger than the heights.
On the other hand, there can be more moons, as the surface is warmer. The lakes were easier to climb up to the surface.
The content theory is focused on the search for what people are active or what they like.
These theories show that people have certain needs and/or desires that are being exploited.
These theories consider what makes certain people want to do what they do and what environmental factors require them to do certain things or not to do them.
Two popular content theories – Maslow's hierarchy theory and Herzberg's two factors theory.
In general, two types of behavior may occur when the leaders begin to lead their former colleagues. One of the ends of the spectrum is the attempt to keep "one of the boys" or "one of the girls".
It is difficult for such leaders to make unpopular decisions, take preventive action, assess work, assign responsibilities and manage people.
At the other end of the spectrum is an unknown person who believes that it is necessary to change all the work of the team in order to be his own.
Finally, the leaders are responsible for the success and failure of the team.
Such conduct often causes disagreement between the leaders and other members of the team.
The same quality standards apply to virtual teams as to traditional commands, but there are few differences.
Virtual team members are often contact individuals for their direct physical group.
They are often more independent than ordinary team members, since their team can meet in different time zones that may not understand local leadership.
The existence of a true "unfathom" team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also part of a unique virtual team.
"Invisible team" is a management team that reports to all members. The non-confidential team sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organisation spend a lot of time creating a learning organisation? The objective of adapting the organizational training concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used in all functional sections of the organisation, creativity and efficiency may occur.
Therefore, the organisation works together to overcome the obstacle and create a new process that satisfies the customer's needs.
In order for the organisation to become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angela (2006) explains the method of sustainability as a method used to help organisations achieve a higher level of achievement.
The neurobiological data provide evidence of a physical theory in the study of knowledge and therefore reduces the scope of research and makes them much more accurate.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior confirms the study of researchers.
For a long time, it has been known that various types of brain damage, pain, abuses and habits are behavioural and cause some mental changes.
In view of new technologies, we have the opportunity to see and explore unknown brain structures and processes.
This gives us a lot of information and materials to help create models of imitation and better understand processes.
DI has a strong connection to scientific fantasy, but it is a very important computer science framework that deals with behavioural, learning and interchangeable skills in the machine.
In the case of DI machines, automatic tasks required for smart action shall be examined.
Examples include management, planning and planning, customer diagnosis and questions, as well as written recognition, voice and face.

For example, the Bennet school students in North Carolina each year visit a website about their journey to the capital, each year this site is rebuilt, but the old version is kept on the network as an album of memories.
In addition, online journals can improve the writing of researchers. Although the grammar and writing of researchers in the first online journals are often widespread, the current audience usually changes this.
Since the students are often the most critical audience, the editor tries to write as much as possible in order to avoid criticism.
In addition, the online journals “seems students to think more deeply about the environment.” The need to think about an auditor encourages students to be considerate and interested (Toto, 2004).
Networking is a means to stimulate cooperation and promote learning beyond traditional school boundaries.
The online registers “can help students acquire analytical and critical thinking skills; students can actively respond to the online material, taking into account other people’s records, as well as describe their views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
