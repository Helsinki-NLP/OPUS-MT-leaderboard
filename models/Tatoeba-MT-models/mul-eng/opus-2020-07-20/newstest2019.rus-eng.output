Named after the number of new recruits to be sent to Donbass in Ukraine
The official representative of the National Police of the Lugan People ' s Republic (LNR) said that Ukraine would send at least 3,000 new recruits to Donbass in the summer of 2018-2019.

In 2014-2017, Kiev launched a so-called anti-terrorist operation (TO) that later changed to the Joint Force (OS).
This measure was expected to strengthen the role of Ukrainian forces in resolving the situation.
By the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbassa had deteriorated because of the murder of the head of DNA Alexander Zacharchenko.
The DNA authorities qualified what happened as a trajectory.
A number of persons involved in the bombing were detained during the criminal investigation.

Tramp told about "love" in Kim Chen Yena
From the violence of the United States leaders and the CDR, whether it was easy to get to love each other, Donald Tramp said.
President Donald Tramp of the United States noted the success of his efforts in the face of the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries have now had so much to do with the relationship that the President of the United States noted that they were hardly in love with each other.
The White House recalled that the former administration had adopted the North Korean problem as the main problem in foreign policy.
Tramp noted that Barak Obama's team had lost so much of its relationship with the DPRK that it could not even be called to the country's leadership - there was just no noise.
At that time, the United States and the CDR were on the brink of war, and today the North Korean leader writes in the White House “precious letters”, Trap noted.
Tramp acknowledged that at the beginning of his work, he was also a cruel man to Kim Chen Inu, which was, in fact, mutual.
Now, however, their relationship was so focused on the fact that leaders “loved one another. ”
At the same time, Tromp asked that his words not be understood literally and warned that American media interpreted them as incompatibility.
The tramp drew attention to the fact that Phenyan has recently stopped nuclear and missile tests and has closed military lines.
All of this is the service of his administration, assured by the President of the United States.
In the past Tuesday, Donald Tramp spoke briefly about Kim Chen Yen from the UN General Assembly.
The tramp thanked the North Korean leader for his courage and for the steps taken to dissipate tension.
At the same time, Tromp noted that sanctions against the CDM would remain until the Korean peninsula was fully decollarated.

Nicho called for the "Musco language for the Ukrainian product"
The Ukrainian child writer and fighter for the purity of the native language, Laris Nicho, called for the "Russian-language Moscow product and the Moscow language" to be removed from Ukraine.
To do so, she proposed that the Ukrainian product be "cultural wool and cultural pressure".
With his views on the "intelligentness of the elimination of the Russian language in Ukraine" Nichoy shared with the Ukrainian edition of the "Obezrevator".
According to her, the relevant Ukrainian product is now ready - it is even now available and continues to grow.
In time, the Ukrainians are "healthy" from this "Musco language", she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, she said that the Russian word had been used extensively on television and radio, but it was practically not in public areas.
In the view of Nice, the Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the Russian-speaking authorities, in her opinion, are only “an extension of the border for the Ukrainian word at the legislative level”.
Nicho had previously experienced the support of the Ukrainian language regime in the children ' s camp in Karpata, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016 she was threatened by the Court of the Watson Bookstore network, one of which was associated with her in Russia.
When he didn't get his own, Nicho was shouting at the girl.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians is called "language schizophrenia", calling for the Ukrainians to reject Russian letters even in family writing.
Recently, Nicho stated that the name Russ was stolen from the Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
Even the Ukrainian Security Service was not able to avoid the anger of the writers: when they came there and heard their talks with the Russians, she made a scandal and went and knocked on the door.

Actually, he felt good.
Maybe, at the end of a few moments, there's nothing going on.
And yes, Doctor and physicist Vladimir Anatolievic Gasnev put me in this game for their great thanks!
"What do you say about the air in the team?"
"It's not for anyone to be secreted that after victory and recovery, it's easier to get back and set up in a collection better.
Now we have white fields, even though they were black at first.
We must continue in the same spirit and rejoice in the sick."
"Have you tried the game for the time he didn't go out on the field?"
"That's the one, it's been a while since the really unpleasant situation has gone away.
But again, thanks to the physiotherapist and the doctors who laid their feet.
Most importantly, we won and advised patients.

The charge for the Danish MP was news.
The Soviet Regional Court of Mahačkal was held in custody for two months by members of the Dagestan Rajaba Abdulatipov People's Assembly, suspected of participating in the criminal community, which had established a disability for the arrest.
“E” has become known to the details of the consequences that are reflected in, namely, the version of the Russian Follow-up Committee, the younger brother of the former head of the Republic of Ramazana Abdulatipov Rajab Abdulatipi has already contributed to criminal actions by the former director of the Chief Medical and Social Experts Office of Magomed Mahachev and his associates.
Among other things, during the operational research activities carried out by the ICT staff, it was found that Rajab Abdulatips had lobbyed the appointment of Magomed Mahačev as head of the office, as soon as 70 million rubs had been received.
Recall that, as a consequence of the previous investigation of Magomed Mahačeva, other leaders and staff of the territorial medical and social experts offices under his jurisdiction, a criminal case was brought to light under section 210 (construction of the criminal community using and participating in the official situation), section 290 (receiving of the group), section 292 (service subpoena) and page 159 (mixture of particularly large) of the CRF.
As a result, at the end of 2013, Rajab Abdulatapiov, aware of the illegal actions of Magomed Mahachav and his agents, who had managed the Pension Fund, joined in their activities by entering the criminal community.
In the presence of the head of the Russian Federation Migration Service for Tajikistan and in contact with the authorities of the State and law enforcement structures, as well as with their family relations with the head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdulatipov, the investigators consider that “he provided for the activities of other participants of the criminal community, established contacts with officials of the public authorities to support the illegal activities of Magomed Mahačev and his appointment as head of the federal penal institution, the Chief Medical and Social Expert Office of the Republic of Dagestan, organized an illegal establishment of citizens with disabilities”.

The court had arrested a member of the Russian Federation not for ten days prior to the prosecution, as was the case with the former high-ranking Danish officials, and once in two months, because of the fact that he was a member of the U.S.R.R.R. 210.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is much more time left to make charges, up to 45 hours from the time of detention.

Kosovo: At the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, the issue of Russia was virtually missing
The head of the International Council of the Federation of Constantin Kosachev considers the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly to be a success for Russia and does not exclude it from becoming an integral participant in addressing global global problems.
“The uniqueness of the present 73st session, in my view, is the fact that the rhetoric we've been accustomed to in recent years to Russia has now been more complicated,” said the senator in an interview published in the Russian newspaper on Sunday.
He explained that in previous years the RFF has been “taught as one of the three main threats to humanity, that is, along with Ebola's ligorate, that, in addition to climate change or terrorism, Russia has been in this regard, in any case, in the exhibition of a group of Western countries that has been described as sufficiently uniformly. ”
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed that "the theme of Russia in the negative key had virtually disappeared".
"If the statement of the President of the United States, the President of France, the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, I do not now take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the people were not perfectly correct," he pointed out, stating that Russia "was no longer a barrier to training a tennis player."
The head of the Board of Proficiency of the Sufeda does not rule out that this is a trend which, in his view, “will be allocated to the current session [the United Nations Assembly], although this trend may take place in a total of two or three years”.
"I do not exclude that the current session may in some way be reversible," Kosachev said, explaining that "too many examples of how Russia is able to move forward in international affairs".
As an example, he took the situation to Syria, the region of Iran and North Korea.
"Although this is unfortunately not Ukraine, I am not sure that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be interrupted in time," the parliament added.
This is related to his belief that “the adequate, healthy recovery of Russia as an inalienable participant in addressing global contemporary problems”.
"I don't want to be wrong, but I have a feeling that we're going to go somewhere where the movement won't be moving anymore, it'll be moving forward," he added.
Another “interesting and important feeling” in this context, Kosovo called “a request for a Russian vision of how to develop a modern world”.
"I have attended very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the Geneva Assembly] Minister for Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov, I have held my own meetings, and I have been very pleased to see that if two or five years ago the Russian opinion, the Russian vision of the world, on the large account of no one, is different now," the president of the Soviet Committee said.
In his view, this is due to the fact that “in the so-called new liberal regime, which is rid of the West, there is no answer to the world's problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas on how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of nuclear non-proliferation, the problems of migration”.
"And the demand for a Russian vision will become increasingly evident here," he said with confidence, stressing that he considered "the current successful session for the work of the Russian delegation that was successful for Russia".

She also expressed confidence that trials would afflict each Ukrainian, making us “more serious in protecting the national interests of Ukraine, in protecting each Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what is bad”.

The GG became the second popular in Germany
The Anti-Immigrant Alternative for Germany is a regular record of popularity, while Angel Merkel's ratings fall.
In all, the citizens of Germany began to stand out from the immigration policy of Angel Merkel, which has served as a guiding target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Most importantly, this is the latest issues under which the Anti-Immigrant Party of Alternatives for Germany is becoming increasingly popular and the positions of the right block of Merkel and Zeehofer have been weakened.
This week ADG killed a regular record, raising a second line in the rating of national sympathies.
The right conservatives, with 17 per cent of the population, were able to cover social democracy, with 16 per cent.
One percentage point could be attributed to statistical error, but it should not be noted that ADG from the small group of Eurosceptic economists in 2013 was able to turn into a serious political force.
In general, the leadership continues to maintain the HSC/HDS control block, with 30 per cent.
However, there was a trend towards loss of eyes, while in April the support of Angel Merkel's block was at four percentage points above.
The staff rating of the German Chancellor is also reduced, which is headed by the Government of Germany for the fourth term of office.
Today, 48 per cent of Germans are supported by Angel Merkel, which is 7 per cent lower than last year.
In addition, there were "green" (15 per cent), the left (11 per cent) and the Liberian (10 per cent).

The "Alternative for Germany" party was established in September 2012 on the basis of an alternative 2013 group, which came from the Christian-Democratic Union.
The Group was significantly opposed to the government course, but at first it was only economic issues, including the problems of the euro and cooperation within the EU.
At that time, the group spoke against the "suspension" of the weak economies of the EU in Germany, did not exclude the possibility of a return to the German brand and the full exit of the country from the EU.
As a result of the deepening of the immigration crisis, the political platform of the ADG has expanded.
In 2013, the group became a full-valued party that took over the Eurosceptics and began to critically criticize the Government for the lack of immigration policy.
At the last parliamentary elections in 2017, ADG was the first to enter the Bundestag, receiving 94 MPs (from 709).
Two representatives of the "Alternatives for Germany" received seats in the European Parliament.

Named Death of the Universe
The universe is still some 140 billion years old, ten times the age of the world, which is about 13.8 billion years old.
A study of the international collection of scientists is published in the arXiv.org e-print library and is published in the journal Publications of the Astronomic Society of Japan, reports Japan’s Asahi Shimbun newspaper.
Such findings have been made by experts, with the help of the HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) telescope Subaru for about ten million galaxies.
Following the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, with more than 95 per cent of the world's observed energy, scientists working under the standard space model LCDM (L Cold Dark Matter), assessed the rate of expansion of the Universe, which was slightly slower than was previously considered.
Subaru's press release notes that observations have made it possible to obtain a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of material in the universe, and the European Space Telescope Planck has clarified the limitations imposed on LCDM parameters.
In July scientists modeled the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new evidence that the observing world would end its existence after 22 billion years as a result of the Great Depression.
There was an ongoing attempt to unite the initiatives of the pension referendum
The people ' s view of pension reform has been postponed for an unlimited period of time
In Moscow, a general federal initiative group was convened on Saturday, a referendum against the ageing of retirement.
It was attended by 13 subgroups registered with various formulations of issues (all of the Centres recorded five formulations).
They decided to appeal to the CIC with a request for registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians: "Have you not increased the right to retirement by 1 July 2018, as laid down in the Act on Pensions as of 1st July 2018?"
This formulation was registered by a group of minors who did not participate in the congregation but who considered it to be the most simple and legal framework.
Most of the Assembly participants were members of the “Justice of Russia” Eli Swiridov (six subgroups) and the CRF (four subgroups).
Three independent subgroups from the Netherlands, Voronez and Orenburg have joined them.
Sviridov had previously said "Wedmosts" that the invitations had been sent to all the participants and that about 40 subgroups had agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, the leader of the Volo-year subgroup (her formulation was still supported by 15 subgroups), said "We have been invited" that she did not receive the invitation and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who else but who was the enemy."

In the "Loko" mother, the "Ahamat" Turbin's mistakes broke out like from the root of the weeds.
Former U.S. judge Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of Archbishop Evgen Turbin in the 9th round of the Russian "Lokomotiv" campaign "Ahmat" and discussed the discrepancies of the game.
- How do you value the judgment of Eugenia Turbin in the "Lokomotiv" match?
- I believe that this arbitrator has confirmed his inadmissibility to the trial of the mother of the Russian Prime Minister.
I am surprised that the efforts at the fifth round of Spartak - Dinamo - neither Turbin nor DSI leaders have made serious conclusions about its low-qualification.
The result has not been slowed down in the ninth round: errors in its actions, private losses of gross acceptances have been made as a result of a variety of frauds.
For example, in the 50th minute, the Edera railwayman is injured by his hand in his painting area, the shield of Ahmata Rodolfo.
Eight meters from the gate, but Turbin doesn't put pens.
- How do you appreciate the episode with Ido's participation, which was 82 minutes when it was shown that the sword had fallen into his hand?
- I think there was an intention to play the shield's hand in his painting.
The Turbin has been around for a while, seeing this episode and his first assistant to the case.
This was to be seen by the reserve judge Sergei Karasev.
Nevertheless, all three fell asleep, and the panels were not assigned.
As a result, the account in the register was broken, and sports justice was lost.
This was the very case when the concept judgment was lifted and the game was preserved by a sports spirit.
At 52 minutes, Turbin did not decide to remove Oleg Ivanov's guest protection, who violated the rules against the Crime, and when the judge showed him a wish card, he was demonstrably impressed.
What do you think about this episode?
Did you have to show the second "guarantee"?
- At this point, Turbin and the first wish card didn't show up.
The second would be false.
- Oleg Ivanov said after a match on the double standards of justice that some of the orders are being sent to bars for violations such as in the episode with Idov and there is nothing.
What do you appreciate about the football player's words?
- I think it's a double standard.
It's a pen.
You didn't give it to him.
So the arbitrator doesn't give a second pen in the opposite doors.
Here's the principle used.
And the second moment of double standards, the judge sees who plays.
There he played Lokomotiv on Saturday and in Ahmeta has serious claims to the work of the Turbin, because the team has been attacked.
Matt Damon played in the rape of Judge Cavano at the old SNL
American actor Matt Damon won a candidate in the Supreme Court of the United States of America, Bretta Cavano, accused of rape.
The demon appeared in the first release of the new season of Saturday Night Live transfer to the NBC TV.
During a small beating, the actor played Kavano at the hearings in the prosecution Senate.
The candidate in the Supreme Court of the United States has previously drawn attention to its emotionality and details during the discussion with Senator Amy Clobushar.
Yes, Cavano repeatedly acknowledged his love for beer, but he said that he never drank to the point of unconsciousness.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Kawano stated that he was a girl in that year.
Those moments were also played by Damon.
I was just saying that he drank a lot and didn't think about sex at all.
I was the tallest, drunk girl anyone ever saw.
Everyone knows that," said Judge Matt Damon.
Previously, Cavano had elected the Supreme Judge of the United States.
Barbara Strizand found out in her cloned horses of foreign conduct
American poet Barbara Strizand said that her dead dog’s clones are completely different from the original pitome.
"They don't look like it.
In fact, [the clones] look like her, but it's impossible to clone the soul," stressed 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Straysand ordered two clones of his 14-year-old coton-tolerate species, named Samantha, who had to recover from health problems.
In July 2018 it was reported that the Miracle Milly (Miracle Milly), which was named the world's smallest dog, was cloned 49 times.
Specialists are working on the cloning of six-year-old animals in an attempt to understand why it is so minimizing.
The United States has been thinking about Russia's maritime blockade due to oil and gas supply
In the United States, Russia's maritime blockade can be launched in order to benefit from the world energy market.
The American authorities have been so diligent in their efforts to combat the global carbon market that they are ready to escape to the Russian maritime block, which remains one of the world's leading suppliers of energy.
The head of the U.S. IMF, Ryan Zinke, told of the possibility of the maritime blockade.
Despite world practice, the US Ministry of the Interior does not perform police functions, but civil functions, including natural resources policies.
Therefore, the Zinke statement went fully into the competence of its head office, even though there was no political class left.
In a statement to the industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke stated that the United States military forces control maritime routes in the Middle East and can block them if necessary.
In Zinke's words, the need for Washington to mix Russian supplies into the world's energy market could be linked to the desire of Washington.
Zinke recalled that Russia continues to receive a cheap share of its revenues from the global supply of oil and gas markets.
The desire to share the supply of energy in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main reason for the strengthening of Moscow in this region, believed in Zinka.
The Minister understood that the United States continued to rely on its leadership in the world energy market, becoming the largest oil and gas supplier.
For this, Washington will have to worry about Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockade of trade is an acceptable measure on this route, says Zinka.

He is young, talented, creative and, in his creation, striving for new non-standard forms of self-expression.

In Russia, a club I'm following
Former captain Chelsea and British General John Terry - about why he visited the ninth round of the Russian "Spartacus" "Rostos" (0:1).
"In Russia, I have a club that I follow.
I've been following him a lot lately, and I've been interested in looking at him.
I can't say I'm a patient, as my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartacus, and I want to apologize for the decision," says Terry's Chelsea Hospital.
Remember, "Rostov" with 18 glasses was placed on the third floor of the tournament table, and Spartak was placed on the fifth floor, with 15 glasses active.
In the next tour, white and white on 7 October, they're playing with Enisem, and Valeria Carpin's trusted Valerie Carpin will be hosted by Orenburg earlier.
The expensive script was placed in a stand-alone lobby.
When the LBC Boutique and Loan lobby was located in Somerville (Massacucets), a man offered a script for the appearance of the old and unpretentious instrument of the lobby staff.
But the experienced store manager, Dylan Mcdermitt, suspected that it was an old and expensive tool and sought advice from the expert.
It was found here that the script was produced in 1759 by the famous Italian script master Ferdinando Galjano and estimated at $250,000.
The only link to the script is estimated at $16,000.
The investigation revealed that the script had not been stolen so long in one of the city's residents, and the instrument was returned to the legal owner.
As far as it is known how the script fell to the man, we put it in the lobby, but there are no previous interviews with the law.
The manager said that now all those in Lombard would ask the script to play on it to make sure that it really belonged to the client.
In the ninth tour of the RPL, we are faced with an overwhelming contrast: Spartak will take over at its stage in Tushina "Rostos" under the leadership of Valeria Carpin, a human being, as well as a non-foreign "national team".
The special feature of this meeting is that the clubs now have the same number of glasses as 15, and they make 3 and 4 seats in the tournament table, leaving behind a far-fetched "Zenata" and being in one of the "Krassodara", which is playing with "Dinamo" tomorrow.
In the white and white areas, the club is once again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the League of Europe, the command of Massimo Carrery was suddenly taken by the Rapidu, and recently entered the home of Ahmatu.
After the crackdown with the CSCA, which ended with a fair nothing, Spartacus had a minimum account, not without work, in Quebec of Montenegro, and had been talking about whether Russia's most popular club was nearing the end of the crisis.
"Rage" could not win three matches, so the injuries don't know five anymore.
Let's see if Carpin can extend the series without prejudice to himself as a mother.
The previous Caribbean "Rosto" meeting with "Spartacus" ended with the capital team.
It started at 19:00.

The translator compared the mind of Russians and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but few differences between them do not play a major role in understanding each other.
On the International Translator's Day, 30 September, the professional translator-synchronist Berbel Saxe told about this.
It has been translated into Russian and English for over 30 years.
"The Germans like to plan events calmly, and the Russians say, "they've been urging them to eat soon."
But it seems to me that for the understanding of peoples and for the work of the translator, this is not a major role," said a specialist in the commentary on RIA News.
According to the translator, to understand that the two countries are not interdependent, "it's enough to know history".
And in the future, she noted, Germany has no reason to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no reason to try to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, lots of things that define our general judgment," she said.
Earlier, German Chancellor Angel Merkel stated that the country was trying to “link and support relations” with Russia.

"Collega spoke of the patients "Sibiri," and I want to mention our patients," says the official White website.
"I hope they will support the same way, because now almost every game is a full stage, excellent atmosphere.
In the game, it is likely that God helped Sibiri today because they have already made a very serious mistake, especially our leaders.
We've actually lost the micro-match 0:3 of our leading leaders, so it's been hard for us to get out of this match, though there were moments.
But still, I'm going to blame myself.
'Cause we've let it go. That's what we're doing.
It was the second command compared to the previous mother."
"It's an inexhaustible comedy."
Eyewitnessed by Agutina's election at the Golos show
The viewers of the Golos 60+ show accused Leonida Agutina's teacher of "inexhaustible humour and pressure."
When he first heard the voice of his father, Nikolai Agutina, in secret, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not return to the office.
But his sons' feelings took over, and he chose a relative in his command.
Then many thought this was a joke, but they forgave the teacher for the failure of the first phase.
But the noise was slow, and the star's father was absolutely wrong to take the place of more honorable performers.
And now the observers are not ready to forgive Augustine for such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the viewers of the show, were upset by the infamous and open opposition of our close relatives to the final palace.
I even doubted that Agutina would have the strength and the conscience not to go to the end of her dad's first place," Irina Petrovsky and Xena Larine discussed the program "Man from TV".
Meanwhile, because of his father, Leonid Agutin, the wonderful performers who actually drank, while Nikolai Petrovich was playing a tricky song about his mother, explained that the viewers still want to see his father in the show.
But, as it turned out, the viewers wanted an objective evaluation and to see in the final, really talented performers, and now Agutin is discriminating the show.
"I'm referring to the "Golos" participants from the Agutina team - they've been rejected."
"Agutin showed his love for the pope last time, and today he was supposed to be a professional."
"Concurs has lost its meaning."
"Get out of the project of two talented people and leave in the project of your father who doesn't die and jump, how can you then call the teacher?"
"It's nice to see Dad, organize a concert in Kremlin for his money and see how many people will come to this concert."
It's the Golos show, not the Big Family show.
"It was unprofessional on the part of Augustine."
"Then you have to offer your own show to speak to the pope instead of to the show that's done for the money of 1 Canal."
"That was a real chance for someone, and he took some place.
And I don't understand why the pope has to make me understand more than any other participant with real oral data.
Why did the work from the Surgut with a great voice and a fever flow, and the pope of Augustine brought it to the end?
And then we all regret that on stage and on screens the same person for decades!
That's why you're not going to break the chain of humour."
"What did you expect?
That's Russia!
It's round blue and purple.
And the money in the family budget will be worth it!
The theater's out there!"
Users also recalled that in one of the traditional "Golos" seasons, the son of the City was raised in blind hearings.
Then the meter and the head didn't have to take the son into their own command.
More than that, he said, "Come on, get out of here, all right."
Agutin was unable to act as a professional.

According to him, the scientific community is currently working on the development of such a work.
"Consolidated opinion is not yet," stressed the scientist.
He noted that one of the options was the location of a low-frequency radio telescope on the other side of the moon, which would help to avoid the damage caused by the Earth.
"This is the only place where such telescopes can be deployed to study space radio sources," Peterukovic added.
He also believed that the moon could be used to test the engineers, use local resources for construction.
In addition, cosmonauts should be drawn to the Earth satellite of the primitive body, which is considered to be scientific.
This could help to determine how life appears on the planet.
The former head of the Roscosmos Corporation said that the RF could carry out a pilot flight in the moon by 2030.
The accused client threw the case with the falsifiers in 7-Eleven
Damian Simms, 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg (Florida), who is known as "my tooth" to the manager of the 7-Eleven-net circular store: in May he was released from the store for misconduct.
And he decided to reject his enemy in the original way.
On the second night, he went to the store and threw out of the store and some of the items on the boxes of goods that he had brought with him.
In the corsina there were facules and bruises that Simms "used" from the nearby mobile biotovule.
The police had arrived at the scene and arrested the "master".
He was put in prison and released to court at $300.
It was charged with illegal entry into foreign property and criminal offences and was prohibited from entering the store and approaching the manager.
Although Simsa's crime seems rather ridiculous than serious, the court may be serious enough, as he has repeatedly violated the law: theft, theft, illegal arms control, car control and cruel treatment of animals.

The Russian pilot Williams, Sergey Sirotkin, commented on the outcome of the Granpre race in Russia.
"I'm telling the truth, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and on the second turn, I was between two cars, which I suddenly felt sorry for.
I lost all the positions that I had taken at the beginning, right now.
He was in a very bad position.
He's been shot in traffic.
It was hoped that after the rest of the pith stop, we would fall into the "clean air" and return to the temperature, but there was no rain anymore.
Plus, he had a fight with a partner, and he had a contact with him.
As I understand it, he's a little wrong.
We've been in this situation for the most unhindered season, and I couldn't do anything, and that was very painful, if it's true.
I don't want to talk about it anymore," says Sirotkin RIA "Newsty."
We remember that Sirotkin, in the race at Granny Russia on 18th, became the winner of the British Mersedes pilot Luis Hamilton.
Tarpišev called the absurd removal of Glušakova and Estenko from Spartaca
President of the Federation of Tennis Russia (FTR) Shamil Tarpišev commented on the removal of the Moscian "Spartacus" by Dennis Glušakova and Andrea Estenko from training with a major post-leap post on the criticism of the chief coach of the team of Masimo Carrery, reports "Sport Weekend".
Carrier's actions were absolutely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is an indiscriminate folly.
I totally disagree with what Karen is doing.
It's just deepening the gap in the team.
First of all, it's a verse, reading and understanding them as appropriate.
I wouldn't have reacted to that at Carrery's place.
Each one has his own opinion.
Second, everyone wants to cry.
If Glushak and Estenco put up a lie, that doesn't mean they have anything against the coach.
I think Italians don't understand the flexibility of the situation.
And that doesn't serve the normal climate in the team.
Today, Spartacus has no game, so this situation has not been to be resolved.
Maybe you should laugh about it once.
"Spartacus" has many different lines, there is uncertainty after the introduction of youth.
The relations within the teams, the judges of the whole, do not add optimism to the matter," Tarpistev was convinced.
The two teams will be held on 30 September and will begin at 19 a.m. by Moscow time.
Previously on Spartacus, John Terry, led the young Chelsea team.
Sirius ' s teachers discussed science-like technologies
Teachers of the Education Centre Sirius in Socia, Agrobiology and Plant Genetics School attended the lecture of scientists at the National Research Centre of the Kurchatov Institute.
The presentation of researchers was part of the Global International Forum on Convergent and Natural-like Technologies organized in the Court under the direction of President Vladimira Putin of Russia on 29 September at the educational centre.
The lecture opened a documentary film "Code Kurchatov", during which the President of the Kurchat Institute, RAN Correspondent Mikhail Kowalchuk, told of global challenges as a driving force for civilisation development.
A lesson published by a scientist on the Sirius website.
Schoolers have learned that modern technology is needed in a large amount of energy.
Alternative energy is still not possible.
This problem, as the forum organizers say, will be addressed by similar technologies that young scientists are working on today.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the issue of responsibility for developing similar technologies, as well as discussing the risks posed by such technologies.
"The access to such technologies is a unique thing, it's a colossal good.
This is an explosive growth of medical technologies, improving quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's a second side.
The development of similar technologies is indeed a technological restoration of living systems.
There is a trading party, a targeted involvement in human activity.
There's always a risk.
A car appeared, and people fell under the wheels.
But cars use everything the same.
The dual nature of technology is soon.
I'm creating a new medical technology, and I can create weapons of mass destruction," says a scientist REN TV.
Following the review of the film and the discussion of contemporary academic discrepancies, students were able to raise questions for the participants.
In the role of the speaker, the candidate for physical and mathematical sciences, the leader of the Kurchats NBICs-Kurchats-like technologies NIC "Kurchatov Institute" and the leader of the Kurchats NBICs-Technology Group Vacheslav Demin.

Russia's Kazan River threatened the United States
The biggest threat to the United States fleet is the Russian underwater boat Kazan.
In this regard, American admiral Dave Johnson, referring to The National Interest, has made a statement.
"We are threatened by a serious potential opponent.

In the view of the principal UNIFEM commander in Europe, James Foggo, Russia focused its efforts on modernizing its underground fleet.
Macedonia: The referendum was not due to a low rate
The referendum was called upon to approve the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje on the conversion of the Balkan country to North Macedonia.
Greece objected to the use by Macedonians of the name of its historic province.
The change led to the opening of the path to NATO and later to the EU by the former Yugoslav Republic of Yugoslavia.
But, according to the EFE agency, only 34 per cent of the resurrected audiences "did not reach the constitutional threshold by 50%.
However, since the referendum only had a consultative nature, it may be that the Skopje authorities decided not to reject the name.
Speaking soon after the closure of the electoral offices, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a representative of the Republic ' s nomination, said that, if more "yes" were to appear among the votes cast, Macedonia would change its title, not being able to see the quorum.

The Kemerovian was wearing a barbed - wire bar on the table
On 30 September, a well-known Cameroonian social network reported to the public that wild animals were being freely exploited on one of the local warehouses.
The animals passed through a small stage between the fence and the grass.
The commentators expressed various views: one of the local residents noted that there was no harm in the presence of a small red cat in the area, and their appetite could even help to clean the territory of the sorghums and grasslands, but some of the inhabitants of the town did not have a soul:
"It's possible, not a trap.
I don't want to do anything there.
Of course, you don't say they're mad, but that's not the case."
In other words, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem of animals in the habitat had already been known, and the necessary measures would soon be taken.
How right is it?
The word does not exist.
That's right.
The word "to push" means "to push, to influence, to influence" is only phonically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [of] the word "to be satisfied".
We use this word, believing it comes from the word "pressure".
But "pressure" and "satisfaction" are not only close, but even in some sense opposite.
Be sure about that.
To give (the Church.-book, the elderly) means "sufficient, sufficient, sufficient, sufficient to be enough for anyone or anything, to be satisfied."
Satisfying, pleasure is a family word.
Previously, it was important to "do not depend on anything, have self-sustained" - "satisfied."
The old Slovak "wish" literally means "wow" and "wow".
Give it to me, give it to others.
These words are now frightening "family": daos - wolf, deyja - "kill" and twelve - "presso".
A similar poetic form of the words “pressure” and “fulfillment” as well as the imminent resurrection of the last has forced them to enter into contamination.
So we had the very "d" to draw, which is also used in letters through "a", which is better, incorrect and impossible from the point of view of the processes of origin and development of these words.
So, that's right.
But this word is older, in its proper sense it is no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have a negative influence on you above, use the word "give".
You can also use the "pressure" construction, but remember that it's the office.

In fact, it's almost as bad as it's going to be."
"It'll be a key moment when the start of the race is very difficult."
"I'm sorry, yes, but you never know how it all works.
It'll be rather easy anyway, because our car is a remarkablely slowing machine Mersedes.

The Agreement on the Renovation of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with the neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of its neighbour to be called Macedonia, taking into account the same Greek province and Greek history.
Lupko Petkoskii, politician: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia has the right to a better future, a hope for public change.
And Greece will have the right to its past.
There are no ideal agreements.
They are the result of difficult compromises that cannot make everyone truly happy."
On behalf of the country, the ruling Social Democrats are represented in the head with Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Against - Conservative opposition and President of the country, George Ivanov.
According to journalist Cvetina Chilimanov, Macedonia has no reason to enter into the EU - it is sufficient to have partnerships with him: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government, in its head, is forced out of the country to change the name of the country.
But this decision has a negative effect.
First of all, I'm losing sovereignty.
Clearly, there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans."
Fei Dullgeri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the greatest challenge in its history.
The country was on its way.
The election made by Macedonian citizens will determine not only the future of the Balkans but also Europe as a whole."
