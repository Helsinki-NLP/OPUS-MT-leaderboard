The population's triumph in Rakouska, totaling 29 per cent
The emotional weaknesses of both sides of the supply of large coalitions and the express strengthening of the rights of the populist parties have led to the first preliminary results of the early parliamentary elections in Rakosque.
In particular, a strong loss suffered by the Rakouska People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molter is seriously deteriorating.
On the other hand, the volunteer leader Svaza for the future of Rakouska (BZÖ), the Croatian hero Jörg Haider is making a triumphal return to national policy.
According to the preliminary results, the most powerful party in the country of social democracy (SPÖ) remains with 29.8 per cent of the votes against the last vote since 2006 but 5.5 per cent of the vote is lost.
Another high incidence of ÜVP, which is lost by 25.6 per cent of almost nine per cent of the votes.
These are the worst results of both of these great parties in the history of the Raquesian holiday, and in particular in the people who voted for earlier elections, the fate of the disaster.
At the beginning of July, when ÖVP was released from coalica, people in preference to SPÖ had a significant impact.
However, the lovers apparently insisted that they let the government spend.
As a result, speculation about the possible rejection of the president and the Deputy Chancellor Wilhelm Molter had already been identified in the first responses.
The observers argue that this could be done by Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the presidency of the party.
Such a development would obviously facilitate the path to the most likely outcome of the voluntary outcome and to the restoration of the great coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of the two legitimate populist parties - the Free Party (FPÖ) received mainly 18 per cent and the BZÖ 11 per cent of the votes - but the social democracy also expressed concern about the repatriation of 1999 when the people agreed with the populists (when the FPÖ was still one, in 2005 it withdrew from BZZU) to the common government, which even imposed sanctions from the European Union.
For this development, Hayder, who has already announced that he is ready to cooperate with any party and plans to return to Vienna for a comprehensive policy.
The Green Party was still brought to Parliament, but it was easy to lose and lose between the Russian political parties from the third to the fifth place.
None of the other parties apparently crossed the four-percent threshold and did not reach Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can be maintained
If it failed to solve the problem with Czech scientists who were accused of the illegal collection of broccoli in India, the Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg said it would be possible to make sure that the Czech-indicative relations are improved.
The Minister indicated this in New York after a meeting with his Indian conqueror Pranabe Mukhhardji.
"If it hadn't been solved, then yes, then the relief would have come," he said after the meeting, which took place from the Czech initiative.
After the trial, Mukhherdzi said that the court may find it very difficult to do so.
However, he pointed out that in the case of Petra Šváchi, who was released from the complaint and was accused of fraud, the central government may deal with the local government in Dáržiling, in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
For Emil Kucheru, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best for Mucherdji to appeal to a higher court.
Then he can ask for release to jail and to wait for freedom, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also appeared during the interview.
"It recommends calling to a higher court, then it would be possible to emulate him," said the head of the Czech diplomat.
The only way that the Czech party can fully enter is to provide "compliant legal support", the Indian Minister said.
At the same time, he said that such help is already provided by an Indian party.
"We have the highest interest in maintaining with India the best relationships that have long-term traditions.
Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
Also, as the Czech Republic said, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic is of great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We are truly considering the grave mistake of imprisonment and the regret of these Czech scientists," he declared.
The answer to the question of whether it was received by the Indian side of the matter to be taken away by the Minister.
"I've got quite a lot of promises," he just noticed.
If you decide to fight the bottom of the sea
It belongs to a printed electronic map on which Australia is highlighted and the adjacent maritime area.
However, he doesn't care about the continent, but the small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it and the adjacent bottom of the sea.
The area is also large as the same continent," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to a triangular team of the UN Division for Oceans and Sea Law.
His chief, director of the division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, monitors and sometimes supplements.
He's gonna run a job opportunity and a promotion.
The bottom of the sea is already hiding a little known world, rich in natural resources.
It can be found here as bread, raw and other raw materials, but not yet known living organisms, which do not have the key to developing cancer.
Not greater than strength
The coastal states today have started to look forward to a new maritime territory.
According to the UN Treaty, they also exercise their rights agreed in 1982 at Monte Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly about the area of so-called continental shelf, which often stretches up to a few miles from the border of the country.
This has, under the terms of the contract, an exceptional advantage on all sources of continental shelf.
"For the sake of simplicity, the continental shelf has this part of the seabed and its base, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
Sea salts for the coastal borders, often also for the borders of two hundred sea miles such as the exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the country to the Commission for the elimination of the external limits of the continental shelf must be based on extensive scientific documentation based on many cost-effective studies and measurements.
It's the result of a series of years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical assistance.
The Commission has already submitted five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three last-mentioned countries have been successful yet," Mikulka adds.
The world's voice has recently marked Australia's success, which, as a first major expansion of its southern states.
However, the New Zealand - the seabed, recognised by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square miles [1.6 million sq km], and the drought is six times greater than the size of the state itself.
In both countries, millions of dollars were invested.
The profits they receive in the future from the use of the seabed will be priceless as they promise.
It submits its requests progressively to other States.
They can do this up to ten years from the time they ratified the Monte Bay agreement.
There, where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor area begins, legally declared as "the common heritage of mankind".
There's no state of emergency here anymore.
The law of difficulty in this area shall make a contractual arrangement of the international institution.
"The bottom of the sea, but there is no clondak," says President Mikulka in a statement that "the single areas are clearly separated and their regime is legally legal."
Chechnya in Pacific
The part of the seabed today belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are dealt with by other states of some Eastern Block within the framework of the Interoceanmetal Joint Organisation.
This was obtained in 1991 according to the contract, like investors in a few other states, the status of a "procupic investor".
He has the right to live in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, lying between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The Investor's research area is much larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
There's an article there, it's about a kind of southern representation of Tater.
"It can stand on the surface of a total radius of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich find of polymetallic concretes containing nickel, honey, cobalt and manganese," states another lawyer Ind Pakshi Rajan.
Macedonian division worker Rober Sandev brings to the show one such concrete.
It mentions a little beard or, in a few ghosts, a bad scheme that, according to legend, relived Golem.
German units of special attachment were released by hand
The Egyptian government requested assistance from German experts in resolving the crisis.
When the situation was solved, special units were prepared, however, not to be found.
Further details of the conditions of liberation of eleven European tourists in Egypt are progressively available to the public.
According to the data of the defence ministers, German special forces were also directly involved in rescue action.
According to the Ministerial Declaration, both members of the anti-terrorist group, the German GSG9 police, the Federal Criminal Authority, and experts in the logistics of the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk) were released.
According to another communication, however, the two ministers from the German side of the afternoon did not need to go because the prisoners had let their occupation go and drowned when they recognized the signs of violent liberation.
The Government of Egypt accepted the aid offered by Germany as a supporting force for action on the ground.
"There was no luck," said one of the speakers of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs inside.
The contestants sent out a group of passengers composed of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanians, and eight of their Egyptian leaders on the south of Egypt on September 19th.
After their exile in the desert area south of Egypt, they moved their hands between Egypt, Libya, Sudan, and Chad.
The identity of the aliens remained unclear until the last moment, as well as the details of the release or possible payment of the ransom.
At present, there are stocks in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said that the release of arms is in the hands of the German ambassador.
He didn't show up for the details.
There are no information available in Berlin when the storage will return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" list, all five tourists should also fly with the special forces of one of the German Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The American Snow Representative has stopped a safe package
The first chamber of the United States Congress allowed the hard majority to drop a saved package for the financial market at $700 billion.
The index Dow Jones lost a lot of weight together.
Between 206 and 227 votes, the U.S. Snémovna rejected a government rescue package for financial markets.
Despite all the challenges of U.S. President George W. Bushe and the main policies, both sides of the programme, which should address chaos in financial markets, did not find the majority.
The remaining ones of the Dramatic Action were hoping to prove the $700 billion worth of package criticism.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic leaders, called before the vote of the delegation to express its agreement, although the plan is not popular, as it has been said.
"It's hard to get political recognition to avoid something that has not yet come," he admitted.
During the vote, the Daw Jones index dropped by more than six percent, which was about 600 points.
The reason was that investors were worried that a state-guarded package could be missed.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index was raised so that the volume of the package would disappear again after notification.
The experts are now counting on other serious turbulence in the international financial markets.
In order to allow the programme to enter into force, it is necessary to agree with the SNV and the Senate.
Travel agents record increasing booking numbers
It seems that the winter will be good for German passengers on the road:
According to one study, there was a marked increase in the reserve of interest for the next month compared to the previous year - even more than 30 per cent in the winter season.
Despite poor economic growth, the desire for Germans to travel is unhindered.
In the winter season, travel offices reported an increase of 31 per cent in turnover in the same period of the year as the German travel agency (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) announced in Berlin on Monday.
According to the study of the GfK market research institute, there have already been an increase in the number of reservations for the winter months.
Thus, according to the DRV statement, the turnover was approximately 1% higher than in 2007.
Based on these results, GfK numbers are estimated each month to assess data on reservations from 1200 German travel offices and interpolate them on the entire market.
As a result, there were reservations of revenue which reached the end of August 2008.
Because of the poor dollar rate, they have been asked to travel to the United States for the first time, the DRW said.
In these roads, there are about one-thirds of reservations.
According to this, in Germany there are in particular the objectives of Spain, Turkey and Greece and also domestic waters.
First of all, the scheduled departures are in the course, announced by the president of the DRW Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising cost of energy and food, the costs are "for a customer can be read more easily than individually organised".
Laepple explained that the money can save consumers apart from others by using discounts for temporary reservations or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the booking number was very good, so compared with the previous year, there will again be a higher turnover - even though, according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first October
Perfectly recharged powder, beer from the pipes and prominent in the corners of the famous designers.
First on beer.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, a television modulator and she's wearing an earmark.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my watch is from a second.
One thing, however, connects us: we're not even three minutes on the beer shop, and we're already burned with photos and killed with a full memory card - it's my fault, because I'm on October first.
That's how you can make friends.
It seems my left side has fulfilled its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the club's equivalent, so my sense of calm in the circle was more limited.
But right after I get to Theresienwiese, it's better than it seems.
Almost everyone has a woman's skirt or leather pants; no one looks tired or tired - everything is completely normal.
Special views at the station with bananas in chocolate are only my backyard.
One Mnichovanka warns me that I misjudged her: "You're free on the left, in the middle of the lady, right in front of her, right behind her."
I can move the masks back to the left.
"All right," he says and laughs.
The other subtly floating techniques don't stay so long and they have a simple flat cap with the letter "This drink is get dressed!" and they pour on our backs.
The young man with such exhibitionist sculptures is named Bob, from England, and he also came to October.
It looks like "gorgeous" with a long "long".
It'll tell me after you've noticed the right mouse.
Right next to one of those hydrants, where everyone thinks they're waste bones.
Bob is then one of the feared "Wildbieeslers", as in Bavorsk, he is said to publicly to be free of charge to the powerful people.
The other luck is that they don't have alcohol in this way.
Around eight evenings they run around the plain where Oktoberfest runs, mostly doctors who have to take care of the weather drinks.
The health authorities always show up in hives - in four they carry hidden loads from the apartment to the apartment.
They work like most visitors do beer lobes: empty there, full back.
Whoever's lying under the cover of this arm from the window, he won't see.
"That's the same thing that can't go on anymore," one of the doctors called me in answer to my question and disappeared.
Police have published the name of the victim of an accident
The name of the three-year-old woman who died in the hospital after her car broke down in Essexu was published.
The incident at Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon arrived by Carol Paulson from the Dark Chelmsford Road.
She was transferred to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, one-hundred and ten-year-old man was detained for suspecting an independent train.
He was already released at the police station.
Turkish diplomatic observations are widening
Long before Turkey began its attempt to enter the European Union, European powers were sought to penetrate deep into the Turkish territory.
On the east coast of Bospor, perhaps only twenty steps in Asia, is one of the best memories of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasa railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neoresan area.
Then they'll tell you the tour guide.
The building is situated around the end of the scene with a fence on every corner, in view of the absence of a distinction from some provincial German council.
The stone's dirty.
The whole building is slowly falling apart.
But once a man gets inside a stolen treasure, he can no longer doubt the size of the company he was most fortunate to defend.
The station opened in August 1908 by the German Consortium Anatolysko-Bgadadsk Corporation.
Germany, who later joined the empire, had in mind its ambition for the rule of the Middle East with the help of this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and to the territory of South Arabia today.
But German imperial ambitions broke out during the first world war.
Their tracks were attacked by Lawrence from Arabia and his irregular units.
Relative isolation from surrounding areas caused by frozen borders of the war learned is gone
The British and colonial units acted from Egypt and pressed Turkey and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
And bad news came to Hydarpash station.
In 1917, he destroyed the explosion of the municipal train by her developed uncle.
Turkish sources say it's about Saturday.
From then on, it's gradually broken, and events are happening.
Today, however, this barrier to Anatolia and continues to serve in the east - at least symbolic - in order to raise the growing perceptions of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling party Justice and Development - AKP - has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from the surrounding areas caused by frozen borders of the war learned is gone.
Now a new policy is being implemented - Turkey is engaged.
It is remarkable that the Turkish Government has a good relationship with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to examine the parameters of this new policy, I sat on the night train to Turkish capital Ankara, where I had to meet with one of the former AKP experts on foreign policy, Turkish Ambassador Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a coroner ride along the tracks that reminded the ancient world rhythms of the famous night mail document, I reached the Turkish metropolis, which was proposed as a new city for the secular state, which wants to turn back to its Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its well-known Islamic roots, represents the embodiment of the paradigm of the Turkish consensus.
She raised suspicions in the west, especially in Washington.
The taxi brought me to the main state of AKP, ultra-modern stone and stone buildings, which are designed to develop with the facility, surrounded by half of the scattered business houses and shops, where the middle managers in trade clothing - men and women - meet to do the early morning trade.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a medium-term policy with almost every other European political party.
So, you bastard, I'm sure he had Blackberry too.
"The aim of the foreign policy of the party is to reintegrate Turkey into its closest environment.
The student war was anomaly," he told me.
Turkey was cut off from its purpose.
Today, we have to look at the east and the west as well.
It wasn't a choice.
I had to do both.
"But it's definitely time to come," I asked myself, "when may Turkey have to decide?"
"Turecko," he said, "you didn't want to have to come to such a decision."
Then he highlighted what almost everyone I spoke to here said almost to remember: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea around them are similar to the prosperity of Europe and the United States, such as Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically, go along these roads to East Asia and to the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpaša Station, after most of the night worked, I thought of the two German Mr. Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who were watching how this building was built centuries ago.
How surprised they would be to find that European ambitions in the Middle East can now, in principle, be in Turkish hands.
And when I was waiting at the airport for a train back across the Bospor, I reminded myself that Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
So it seems that there was not much confusion at least then, which the continent would have had to make a mistake on this fascinating country.
Memorable lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As a Guildford song leader since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (neglog, September 11th) had at the age of Guildford's Philharmonic orchestra and congregation.
As part of the series of songs, he founded a year on this wonderful congregation of young Proteus.
He was to be 21 years old, but during the last time Proteus sang in 1979, a few of us were about 30 — we simply refused to give up the congregation.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological variable of forms) represented the will and ability of the congregation to get into any music that was presented to him - whether already or the Messiah, whether simply or with the whole orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young congregation was often exciting, always inspiring, and all thanks to the inspiration of the one man and the excitement for the song that remained simply unchanged throughout the time.
As Tod often told us to "let the song speak for ourselves."
He said, "The writer knows what he wants.
It's all in that song.
Then sing it!"
His tactical technique was very clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor whitish.
Even if it was a musical standard anywhere, he's always called it.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If there was to be any conductor fit on the guitar, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades when he was leading the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years, I've reviewed more than 100 of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I've never been one of them lost - and I've been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal humility.
He hated the leaders who, according to his word, simply "sail one or two perishable pecks around the world."
He'll miss a lot of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your nephew William Woodruff (September 25th) claims that "in 1946 he returned to the economic history of Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... and also studied at BSc, MA and PhD".
This comes from Woodruff's author's notes at Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he studied economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time he did dissertation work on the British rubber industry, which was commissioned by Professor J. D. Chambers, and then published in 1958 as a publication of the British rubber industry.
He actually spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and in 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It's not known why Woodruff passed this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the School of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resiny "Flamenco and Life", because his documentary black photographs are amazing.
They gave me a simple and strong struggle with which to admire and respect the photographed dignity and respect.
A show that shows a lot of others.
Resino is able to capture magical moments."
The Honda's gonna fight with its best-selling.
In November, Honda began selling the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the driver of this single space vehicle already has a significant space, he now offers a more spacious interior.
This includes improved motors that increase the comfort of the driving and allow greater fuel resistance.
Evolution is more than a revolution.
That's the second generation of Hondy Jazz.
Although the lines of the new jazz are very similar to the previous model from the aesthetic view, there have been many changes in this single-range vehicle.
For example, innovative design, new platform, larger sizes and new engines should be mentioned.
Before we examine a new model, it should be noted that a new Jazz comes to the market six years after the first generation was introduced.
So the first thing we're looking at is the fact that Honda needed this model for a shorter period than other producers.
Although Jazz is a less famous model in Europe, it has become a phenomenon in other markets.
This is perhaps the case of Japan, the country where Jazz was the biggest car ever sold in 2002, as well as during the year 2008.
In Japan, since the introduction of Hondy Jazz to the market, nearly a million customers have been sold.
The second market has become an old continent with about half a million sold goats in six years.
Honda, however, is ready for the goal of raising new Jazz sales in her category.
Thus, while in 2007, this Japanese company sold 83,000 Hondy Jazz customers, the figures are 100 000 cars, which would mean an increase of 17% in the European market in 2009.
As regards the Spanish market, since 2002, Honda has sold all 8,000 pieces of the Jazz model, which means 6.7% of Hondy's total sales in Spain.
When it comes to the new generation of Jazzu, the management of the Spanish district is expected to sell 2,000 pieces a year.
The arrival of the new Jazzu allows Hondé to significantly reduce the decrease in sales in Spain.
The driving of the car so de facto is expected to end the year with a total of 22,000 sold goods, which means 4 000 less than in 2007 and a down of 16 %.
In spite of this increase in sales, Honda increased its share in the Spanish market by 1.8 %, compared with 1.6 % in the last year.
In 2010, this Japanese company expected to reach 2%.
In order to achieve this part, Honda depends on the success of her next new model.
It has Honda Insight, a five-way hybrid of compact size with a length of 4,37 meters, from which Japanese society promises worldwide sales of about 200,000 pieces a year.
As regards the market, the Japanese producer estimates that 50 % of Insight is sold in the United States, while the remaining percentage divides the old continent and Japan.
The start of the sale of Hondy Insight is expected in the first months of the next year when the public will be represented in Valencia in January.
On the contrary, in the first generation, all dimensions were increased in the new Jazz.
Its length increased to 3.9% meters (five inches above), width to 1.69 meters (two inches above) and structure resolution to 2.5 meters, which means a length of five cm.
However, the height has not changed, and it still makes it 1.52 meters.
The increase in size also resulted in an increase in the interior area.
However, these benefits were achieved through the use of new platforms, but by storing fuel in the middle of the vehicle used in the previous Hondy Jazz.
Also, the volume of the evaporative space - which has a system of two days - increased to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the volume of the evaporative space in the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are issued in version 1.4, because the scope of the load space at Hondy Jazz 1.2 makes 379 litres.
In addition to the external elements - such as the rear LED lights or the possibility of equipping a panoramic mirror - it is easier to access the rear seat.
The doors leading to the second series of seats allow the opening of 80 degrees of turnover 67 in the first Jazz model.
In the second generation, Hondy Jazz is new and engines.
From the start, this small model will be offered with two petrol engines 1,2 and 1.4 litres.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which allows lower consumption, lower emissions of carbon dioxide, and contribute to the excellent improvement of the solar system at the same time as high-point time in the full range of engine power.
The first engine of 1.2 litres has a power of 90 horses at 6000 speeds with a maximum exact moment 114 Nm at 4 900 cycles.
This engine - which had a previous generation of Jazz 78 horses - has a consumption of 5.3 litres and 125 grams of CO2.
In contrast to the previous engine that reached 83 horses in the previous generation, it will now reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 horses has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and 128 grams of CO2.
"Charge Car" prohibits racing.
I do not agree that Nissan has been inspired by this time in nature, specifically for the purpose of developing anti-professional technologies.
This Japanese company has created a robot that is used as an example of flying the head, thus preventing fights.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C, which represents the first step in the technologies of anti-fraud prevention.
Engineering Centre for Technical Progress Nissan Motor Co. robotics developed in collaboration with the Centre for Progress in the scientific and technological research of the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhira Doie, director-General of public relations for technology, research and tag development, BR23C is presented as an extension of four sides of the Nissan security shield.
The robot is responsible for strengthening the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicles of this label.
During the year, each train will create its own personal space for a wave structure, which is very similar to the safety shield of Nissan.
The most important, however, are the complex eyes that are capable of seeing all directions at a rate greater than 300 degrees, which enables them to fly in their personal space without stopping.
In creating this visual function, engineers proposed what they called laser localizer (Laser Range Finder).
This shall indicate the obstacles to the distance of up to 180 metres before the BR23C, the distance of the object shall be calculated and the signal shall be sent to the ballapult microprocessor, which shall immediately be transferred to the warning front of the wheel.
"At the moment when the obstacle is marked, the robot resembles the target of movement and immediately changes the direction around the circle to the right or even greater direction in order to prevent the fight.
The biggest difference in the distribution of any existing system is the fact that all moving manoeuvres are simply instinctive.
If that were not the case, the robot would not be able to react fast enough to avoid interrupting," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and the main engineer of the project.
The robot cannot move the direction up and down and down or diagonally, its movement is limited only to two dimensions and to a direction which is allowed to turn its wheel, however, in the infinite number of directions and possibilities as in the direction.
That's why he didn't use the rotation function in addition to speeding up and slowing down.
"The device only needs to process information every couple of seconds and to be kept in accordance with these data.
It does not require the storage of information or logical intuitions from previous manoeuvres, which can function without interrupting with only two dozen KB memory.
It may surprise you, but we don't even speak about magic or magic."
This is the first step in the development of new technologies immediately preventing conflict, technology in which Nissan predicts use in serial cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are easier and longer than lithium-ion.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the installation of units into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the driver to target and thus avoid obstacles to the road.
Enjoy your fear before taking a hypothetical
It should be acknowledged that the US Ministry of Finance, unless there is sufficient capital for injection, there is no lack of discoverability.
They are in the face of a crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risk mortgages in the bank with questionable solvency, they have created a popular-scientific "Bad Credit Hotel" game online.
Or "Hotel of Bad Credits"... or a crowded hotel.
The hotel, and especially its reception guests, seem to be tired of asking a person once, twice and three times to think about whether it is the right time to ask for a loan.
And first of all, where to ask, which is probably for her purpose.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, even if you don't agree with the details.
This page is more suitable for young people than space for the whole public.
And what happens when the game's over?
There's a dream room in the hotel.
At least something because you don't want to talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital MUFG
The Banking House Morgan Stanley announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank that produces nine billion dollars to get 21% of its capital, has made a significant reduction in its salary rate.
A week after their preliminary agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG was able to buy 9,9 % of the ordinary shares of Morgan Stanley at a single price of $25.25, representing a total amount of $33 billion.
The combined price is 19 % lower than the value of the securities accounts until 31 July.
The MUFG Bank invests another six billion dollars to obtain convertible securities, which will provide 10% of its profit and exchange price of $31,25.
Morgan Stanley confirmed that the entire operation would be carried out on the basis of an average unit price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28 % under his current course.
Morgan Stanley's shares went out of 6.79% and reached $23.07 about 17.00 in Greenwich time.
"This strategic agreement represents an important opportunity for the move to speed up the transition of Morgan Stanley to the bankholding status," John Mack, director-general of this American group, explained.
The new statute adopted Morgan Stanley last week, which should allow him to distinguish his activities, but it is also under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His agreement with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is driving the biggest axis from Wall Street to a far more cautious approach than ever before.
The conditions set out in the Monday, however, indicate that the agreement has been amended over the past few days: Morgan only announced that it sells up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for a total of $8.5 billion.
"We were thinking again a week ago," explained Toshihid Mizuno, executive director of the MUFG, "that our participation will be excellently derived from ordinary actions.
However, given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to limit the risk to a minimum and also cover."
On the basis of the weighted average price, the MMFG shall pay for Morgan Stanley’s securities by 7 % less than their accounting value.
The operation will result in a reduction in profit from the share of approximately 20%.
The agreement assumes that the MMFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into normal shares for a year if the latter are appointed after a certain time, by a price of 50 % exceeding the exchange price, i.e. at $47 gross.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital that will bring MMFG will allow him to use investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his readiness.
However, the speaking group refused to provide detailed information on the strategic projects of both new associations.
Following the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley would have to collapse with the payment capacity of Tier One around 15 %, thus one of the best in the sector.
Morgan confirmed that since the end of August, he's reduced his balance.
The last few weeks have been profitable for the group, because its bourgeois price has fallen by half, while certain costs against the risk of non-payment associated with the debt of the plant grower.
However, these costs increased by about 12 % in the afternoon.
Last week Goldman Sachs, the only other "liver" from Wall Street's big investment bank after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch bought 15 billion dollars, partly from Berkshire Hataway, Warren Buffetta group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quitu.
Re-establish the Republic around socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Huga Cháveze, Bolivian Eva Moralese and Ecuadorian Rafael Correy.
Last week, the third-named speaker presented a proposal for a new Constitution, following the example of his colleagues and friends.
And his mission was fulfilled, with 64% of voters, according to official results covering 80% of the votes, voted in the referendum "an".
"No" according to these results, 28 %, 7 % were free of charge and 0.7 % were free of charge.
In order to be approved by the Constitution, he had to get half of the votes plus one.
Two investigations carried out in the east of the optional rooms and the proposed non-governmental organisation announced a clear victory "yes" on Sunday, with a range of 63 % to 70 %.
Last night, on Sunday afternoon, Rafael Correa asked for the victory of his proposal for the Constitution.
"The constitution won the whole party," he assured and congratulated Equators on the governorate's side of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers south of Quita.
It is understandable to yourself that Rafael Correa was blessed by Chávez and Morales, as well as by his Chilean successor, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which, according to the observer mission of the Organization of American States (OEA), was silent, concerns the text of 444 items that will be "new socialism" promoted by the president.
The proposal of the Constitution is strongly committed by the state over the economy, which rewards the "development plan" of a country that lives primarily from the difficulties of oil to foreign companies and from the debate that sends its immigrants.
The proposal, which was chosen in 2006, also broadens the power of the Head of State, which will be able to carry out two consecutive four-year mandates and will have the opportunity to release the bill.
Correa has already announced that this power will be used and will be applied for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution, on the other hand, reinforces the principle of free health and education, which the president has begun to impose in the country with 13.9 million citizens, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty limit.
Finally, the ban on the presence of foreign troops, which concludes the agreement between Washington and Kitt on the use of an Ecuadorian base as an eastern point of American anti-drug operations.
In Chad, 19 hands were released
The Egyptian command was launched by the invasion of eleven tourists and their eight-day occupations, which were occupied ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian leaders, who were detained in the desert for ten days, were living in the afternoon and health was transferred to the capital of Egypt.
During the morning, the Egyptian command was released in Chad.
The handsmen flew around 15.30, apparently in good shape, on the deck of a special aircraft on a military base al-Maza, closely associated with the international airport in Cairo.
They were immediately transferred without having the opportunity to express themselves in the press, on the deck of the helicopter to the hospital in Maadi, the village of Káhiri, to be detailed by medical examinations.
"They're all healthy" and "no expense has been paid to aliens," said Egypt's Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garan on the train.
From its promise of 19 September during the Safari in a vehicle with all four wheels at the foot of Mount Aunat, at the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of handcuffs was driven from one hiding place to another 35 unknown strongholds.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanians - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four drivers, one border officer of the Egyptian agency, the organizers of the Safari.
A certain lead representative of the Egyptian security components indicated that 30 members of the special units who were approaching the deck of two helicopters appeared on the roof during the night in front of the light.
"There's been a shooting, half of the hostages were killed and the others jumped," said this source that he wanted to stay in anonymous.
He pointed out that almost 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the unit were sent to Sudan, where they received support from the German and Italian commanders.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini, who is from Belgrade, mentioned the role of secret agents and components of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through professional and effective people from our secret services, from special forces," he said without further clarification.
He also claimed that it would be paid out.
The Sudanese army announced on the previous day that the guard had kept a vehicle with all four wheels on which the crew was located, killing six of them, including the German commander and two of them.
The army claimed that they were joined by a group of rebels in Darfur, Hungary for the liberation of the Sudan - Unit (SLA-U), which immediately refused.
Letters - The quiet majority of the cultural resort
The debate on the financing of culture will fill the pages with the headlines and is the topic of a pre-election campaign.
I'm getting better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will rise to collect the poor sums that are provided by small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, and national memorial sites that are starving?
What policy will the federal government remember that they forget their memories and their historical buildings?
That in Quebec, like in Canada, we don't have laws that really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government owes three and a half million euros to restore a mere Chinese castle in the Valley of Loiry?
In our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture and that it must be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all national organisations, and in fact.
In Quebec, in the Federation of the History of Quebec, it strengthens at least 40,000 volunteers to 211 companies for history, memory, archives and genoology, the preservation of a collection of private archives and the protection of archeological remnants for a few minors.
Often these companies are just watching the dogs of our memories, which the hyenas do not hope to protest when promoters and leading agents release their bulldozers on old stones and forgotten graveyards.
When are we finally waiting for the courts for history and memories?
Government Beneluxu State Bank Fortis
The state of Benelux will help the Belgian-Holand Bank fortis, which, as the first in Europe, has been in difficulty because of the widespread impact of the American mortgage market, partly because three countries support the money and insurance institution, which also has a capital share in Hungary, a share of 11.2 billion euros.
This weekend the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch Government agreed to participate in the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Economic Competition.
Fortis is the first in the euro area in which the international financial markets crisis, which has spread in the waves for more than a year, has reached a major crisis, and the decision made in this area could be taken from a certain perspective as a precedent.
For the purpose of a decision which was born on Sunday at night, it purchases all three states almost half (49 per cent) of the bank's foreign property.
The bank sells its share of its capital shares directly, in particular, mainly insurance - assets purchased in the last year by the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
The Fortis bank shares began to break last week, and in the second half of the week, serious signs of the crisis have already appeared in the constitution.
However, analysts agree that with their 85 thousand employees, the bank is too big to let it go.
The company's securities fell by only 12 per cent on Friday, at a minimum of 14 years.
Since the ice cap, the share value of more than two thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the total market capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, however, according to the business leaders.
The management of the company is ultimately responsible for the loss of Fortis's shares on the maritime market related to the adoption of the US package plan at $700 billion.
On Monday, the action was slowed down.
On Friday, a new Director General Filip Dierckx was appointed to the head of the bank.
The money institution also looked for private buyers, and no one has ever reported with a more serious offer.
The Belgian government has already announced that investors don't have to worry about their money.
There was no panic among the clients of the bank, and the sections were not covered by the attack.
In Hungary, Fortis has an independent branch and has also acquired several laser companies.
Leather in the kitchen
Health and health insurance in the United States, based on data from people buying medicines, often discourages the conclusion of an insurance agreement.
Data protection experts are afraid that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme which assesses the use of data on the prescription of medicinal products in any case for authorisation of the person concerned.
This must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we believe the chicken of the leaf," says a letter from Washington Post Richard Dick, author of a program designed to monitor prescriptions.
The insurance companies shall make the insurance and the amounts paid in the case of certain events depending on the health status of the beneficiaries and, where the risk is assessed as too large, the insurance shall not be closed.
Previously, they sent medical examinations and concluded the contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago Dick developed a much easier process: on the basis of the identification number of a customer from a doctor, he will find out which medicines he bought in the last year and half of which the program itself produces the disease he suffers and his health status.
For example, if you regularly buy a large number of medicines to reduce cholesterol, it shows that it has virtually uncontrollable high levels of blood vessels, which will immediately lead to a high risk category.
There are now several versions of the programme, some of which are currently determining the risk coefficient, so there is almost no work besides papering, although there are little problems.
It is not surprising that liquefied medicines can also be used for several purposes, some of which are used for example against migraine or fever levels, but are also effective against depression.
They represent an important risk factor in commercial insurance, which is not the first to be mentioned.
For the purpose of requesting and processing data, a special company was established which, prior to receiving the necessary information from a physician, requested permission from the patient.
It's now being forced by the authorities, perhaps they're not concerned about their incompatibility.
Some companies have recently also been working on the results of laboratory tests that relate to the data on medicinal products used, which can provide a more accurate picture of the condition of patients.
Access to data is increasingly limited to companies, while monitoring their use will be more difficult.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, but its effect depends only on healthcare providers and insurance.
The proposal of a law which gives the authorities the right to control and the companies specialized in the provision of data is before the Congress.
Richard Dick admits that this is not enough: so his program developed so that the data collection is linked to the express consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that the authorisation concerned may only be difficult to withdraw, otherwise the insurance agreement will not be concluded with him.
So they're blind, but they're just someplace on the list of good will.
Global Marseilles Menu
European Union and India bilateral trade
As the European Union and India are inter-negotiated trading partners, this issue has been introduced in addition to other, mainly global problems as well as a series of meetings at the highest level.
The French-indicative summit will also be held today, particularly on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union also recognises that India is developing with the democratic power that should be given greater opportunity to speak in international affairs, while the Member States have not yet been able to find a common denominator in the issue of the support of the permanent member of New Dilli in the UN Security Council.
This question was not even considered at the ninth summit held in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy as current President of the Union, the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso and the High Representative for Foreign Policy Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed to double the trade by five years or increase to more than a hundred billion euros.
In view of the fact that the exchange of goods between 2000 and 2007, is between 25 and 55 billion, it is not ambitious.
In this respect, twenty-six already existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation have been frozen from the legal perspective, so the green has reached future and air transport.
By the end of 2009, India and the Union would like to sign a free trade agreement.
Sarkozy promised they'd be speeding up.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is the first trading partner in India, New Delhi is between EU partners to 9th place.
The summit also paid attention to the global issue.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, with regard to terrorism - the two parties decided in all its forms and called for the rapid withdrawal of the UN conference.
They also called for the end of the Dauha business trip, although they both have a large share in his failure.
The European Union has confirmed that it will remain in its energy and climate programme, while it would like to reduce the emissions of harmful substances by at least 20 per cent by 2020.
It also agreed with India, as well as with the fact that a global agreement and the production of greenhouse gases would need to be concluded at the next year's climate conference to reduce the greenhouse effect by 10 per cent by 2050.
Both parties would also like to avoid increasing food prices and support the call for an international conference to deal with the financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Prime Minister comes to the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting he is going to close the trade on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris believes that credit for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors at the value of EUR 20 billion will be earned by the French companies.
According to the Agency's reports, the agreement should be valid for 15 years.
In Frankfurt there are more than three Italian publishers.
A large share of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
More than three Italian publishers are participating in the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International Frankfurt Book fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred different countries to take 171,790 square metres with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to be seen, with Turkey as a honorable guest.
Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inaugural festival in Italy: Italy is actually participating institutionally with the Italian Middle East (Punto Italy) – 264 meters of square exhibitions.
The meeting will follow with the press in Room Structure Buchmesse in Pavilion 5.0: this will be an opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives regarding the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign authors' books is constantly reduced in relation to the total Italian production, mainly in the light of literature for children and adults.
Found the plane Steve Fossetta, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of Steve Fossetta, a millionaire who disappeared on 3 September 2007, was found while he was flying through the desert in Nevada.
Troske was found at one top level in the sea height of three thousand metres, in the Mammoth Lakes region of Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
But within the year, there were no human remains.
Sheriff Madera County, John Anderson, resolved the mistakes that still remained: "The plane was found, we sent to the team and now we are sure that one of the exact things Steve Fossett flew on the day he disappeared," said at a press conference.
The sheriff thus confirmed that no human remains were found in the airport or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old is considered dead from the U.S. unit.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) announced that several hours after the detection, the investigation team, which finally identified the aircraft, was not aware of Bellanca 8kcab, not since 3 September 2007, when Fossett arrived from Yerington in Nevada for a three-year flight.
Yesterday, still in California, near the border with Nevada, some Fossetto's personal items were found in one couple near their shelters in Mammoth Lakes.
It is about two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, about cash in cash and one unit.
The search for Fossetta was cancelled a month after his disappearance.
A billionaire got a place in history thanks to a long collection of primers.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete his journey across the world to the air balloon: two weeks of flight alone.
Three years later, the world was in a plane and without a stop.
Its many records also include years of height of 15,445 metres, above Andami, even with a helicopter.
Glk, ads you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and exactly defined decided lines, wide surfaces with exact roots.
This is, in short, the last Glk born from the "compatibility" pockets of the star house, which Mercedes-Benz tried to put the news into this sector.
Its unconventional processing will be unexpected and unconventional and communication that will ensure the introduction of Suv Glk into the market and will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October next.
In this way the advertising campaign, which runs the new vehicle's debut, also begins informal communication through the 3D futuristic payment campaign, which is the first to be used in Italy for the car ticket.
The project of maxi posters, divided into three different phases, will dominate the main Milan trade class, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of a car in a stereoscopic vision and using special glasses, which will be distributed near Corsa Como, will be possible to see a new Suv in almost actual sizes and in a three-dimensional format.
Actually, when you look at the picture, you'll have the idea that the car will go out of the plaza.
Then, thanks to the use of the innovative technology Elumina8, the new Glk will be cleared in different moments in all its small ones so that it can be recommitted in one picture.
Mercedes is certainly trying to get this advertising something new into the stereotype field of car communication.
Will he be able to awaken the interest of future customers in this way?
So we know who the Italians are.
From Trivenet, they're risking Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls who are now ashamed of Italy? They are members of the "Ultras Italia" group, which has been following the National Azura for years and which has, in fact, never done any problems.
She's never even met a fanatic resistor.
Group orientation is legal.
The depositor's coming from Trivenet.
From Verony, Padovy, Testu and Udine.
In Sofia, groups (in fact a small group) from Campania and Puglie were added.
They have triangular trains on which the cities of origin are present: they were removed on Saturday evening so that they would not be identified.
They're inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found real Nazi fans, Levski.
Figc made available to Italian fans 144 entrance to the game: all by name, and thus easy to control.
And Viminale really checked everything: among those who went out to Sofia, there was no one with the passing Dasl, no one who would be forbidden to visit the stadiums.
Four blue fans, who had earlier transitions from the stadium, had been denied entry and banned.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the reports coming from the Bulgarian police and then takes action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or those who have been identified during the investigation.
The international Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums but also throughout Europe.
Our chuligans, briefly, are no longer moving to one stadium.
Good luck.
But now there is fear of emulsion: that means more than a hundred others are added.
"We must immediately extinguish this fire and not justify those who act this way," they confirm from Viminal.
So, "A well-opened eye, mostly because of a national strike in the middle of Lechi."
It's just in Puglia, it's a small support core.
Tomorrow is Osservatorio, in the afternoon Casms, which can also be counted with one part of Aise, is about a secret service that deals with problems right at the stadiums.
"Court Leader and Head of Defense during Mamely Hymny? It's not a crime in Bulgaria."
This is the idea of Domenica Mazilli (expressed in a very happy way), which has been the director of the Viminal Osservatory for a few weeks (founded the place that was formerly Francesca Taglenente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously a farmer in Terst, where there is the core of the support of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
It's true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it's not a crime to celebrate the leader, but of course, the behavior of these 150-200 fans is harsh.
"I am not a sociologist - the Osservatory Unit - the crimes are committed in the country in which they took place.
So far, this group has remained in the gap, and now we see what has happened and we appreciate the future.
But let's also talk about starring at Mameli's hymme: it's not even a crime, but if you allow it, it's an incompatibility...".
