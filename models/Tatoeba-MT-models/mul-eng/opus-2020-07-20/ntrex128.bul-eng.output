Members of the Wales Assembly are worried that "they look like monkeys"
Part of the members of the Assembly were cut off from the proposal to change their call to "CUP" (members of the Irish Parliament).
This proposal is prompted by plans to change the name of the Assembly of the Wales Parliament.
Members of the whole political spectrum are worried that this could be a cause for laughter.
One of the librarians said his group was upset because the new name was "removing with Tup and Vdlub."
For readers outside Wells: This is certainly of great importance in Welsh.
According to one of the members of the Plaid party, the whole group "is not happy" and proposed alternatives.
The representative of the Irish Conservative Party indicated that his group "is not convinced" to change the name, but notes that the new name CVP (in English – MWP) has a certain vocabulary with "mmap".
In this context, welch W is similar to the English Yorkshire production of U.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently preparing the draft legislation, has made the following statement: "Of course, the final decision on all the descriptive names referred to by the members of the Assembly will belong to the members themselves."
The Wells Government Act of 2017 gave the Wells Assembly the right to change its own name.
In June the Commission publishes the results of a public inquiry on the proposals, which set out a broad support for the Assembly to start calling the House of Wales.
As far as its members are concerned, the Commission prefers "members of the Wales Parliament, in short "CPU", but the "CUP" option has received the greatest support after a public inquiry.
The members of the Assembly offer alternative options, but reaching consensus will clearly be the head of President Elin Jones, from which the blackness of the bill on change to a few weeks is expected.
The Reforming Bill will also include other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules on disqualification of its members as well as the Commission's own design.
The members of the Assembly will have the final vote on how they will be called when they arrive at the discussion of the draft law.
Macedonians will vote at a referendum if they change their country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change their country's name in the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The referendum is planned to allow for an ongoing ten-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, in which there is an administrative area called "Macedonia".
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to the Greek State territory, and has repeatedly expressed its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who is a sponsor of a referendum on the change in the name of the country, has become aware that you will not vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change in the name of the country is just the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells hide behind the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"If we look at the historical plan, according to the old people I talked to, there was a bar and a church literally on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today both are gone."
Adams says the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"Hors today socialize in various ways," he adds.
"The bars are no longer the neighborhoods every day, where everyone gathers regularly."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not reach as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will be in the same position."
The man adds that the churches can be replaced by blocks of apartments where people do not help save the rest of the apartment.
"The vast majority of people who buy dwellings in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, since it is not particularly likely that most new inhabitants will visit them."
Both churches were built by white spas, before Harlem was converted into the Black House – the Metropolis community in 1870, and Saint Martin’s decade later.
The original white methodical fall took place in the post - 1930 ’ s.
After that, the building became owned by the black people in the apartment.
"St. Martin" was a poet of black Christians under the leadership of the similar John Howard Johnson, who organized the fight against black traders on the 125th street, which is the main market street in Harlem, because they did not want to hire black people.
In 1939, the building suffered severe fire attacks, but Father Johnson's younger sisters set up a plan for her restoration, where the bells were ordered.
Similar David Johnson, son of Johnson's father and heir to St. Martin, proudly calls them "the poor peasants".
The expert who used the bells in July has another description: "Cultural treasure" and "unchangeable historical instrument".
The relevant expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that this is the first system of bells in the world used by black musician – Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the larger system in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merivuder said that from St. Martin they didn't replace him.
What was played in St. Martin over the past few weeks was a complex story, driven by architects and performers, some brought by world church leaders, and others by the Episcopal Episcopal Epistle.
From the newspaper – which is the leading authority of the passion consisting of the world's leaders – they wrote to the parish in July, expressing their concern that the parish would "be willing to transfer the costs of the newspaper", even though it did not play a role in the occupation of the architects and performers sent by the parish.
Some heroes have complained about the lack of transparency by the eparphagus.
A 13-year-old child is injured by a shark in a bear hunt in California
Acula attacked and hurt 13-year-old boy last Saturday, while it was a nightmare in California on the first day of the hunting season, the authorities reported.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near the beach of Bican in Ensinitas.
Chad Hamle shared in front of KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been messing with friends about half an hour in the morning when he had the boy screamed for help and went in with the whole group to get him out of the water.
Hamle first thought that the child had caught a fever and was excited, after which he found out how to cry, “Get me down!
I'm caught!"
Haml shared that when he got to the boy, he realized that the whole area of his key was broken.
"I called everyone out of the water, because there's a shark!" added Hamul.
The boy was transported with a helicopter to the Children's Hospital "Rady" in San Diego, where he was treated critically.
Not yet known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
Captain Larry Gilles made a media briefing that a few weeks earlier in the water had been noticed by a shark, but it was estimated that it was not of a dangerous species.
Jills adds that the victim has caused traumatized injuries on the upper part of his body.
The responsible authorities closed access to the coastal line from the beach Ponto in Casablad to Suomi in Enstinas for 48 hours from security considerations while the investigation was under way.
Gilles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which are not dangerous to humans.
Sainsbury is planning a promotion on the UK market for wonderful products
Sainsbury is facing Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening fields for wonderful products in their facilities where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant market deficit for wonderful products in Britain, estimated at 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and home products are declining, the largest market shares for wonderful products will be available in 11 shops throughout the country, after which such projects will be opened in more facilities successfully.
The investment in the beautiful industry is done at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on the premises, soon occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and other household appliances.
From Sainsbury they said they would double the number of wonderful products offered to 3000 products, and for the first time they included brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees product ranges will also receive more space, like the suggestions in Boots stores.
The supermarket also rescinds its botical gamma gloves so that most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly sought by younger consumers.
In addition, the perfume trader Fragrance Shop will try programs for discounts in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which he opened in Croydon, south London last week, while the second will be opened in Selie Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online and misleading marketing focuses on the marketing of smaller quantities of food at a comfortable time of day leading to the need for more efforts by supermarkets to attract buyers.
Mike Cape, chief executive director of Sansbury, has said that the objects will look more like universal stores as the top brands are trying to compete with the Aldi and Lidl discounters, offering more services and non-food goods.
From Sainsbury there are hundreds of items in Argos stores, as well as openings of Habitats since they bought two weeks ago – for which the company claims it has increased the sales of food goods and made the gains even more attractive.
The previous experience of the vergata supermarkets to prefascinate their objects for beautiful and pharmaceutical products was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury made a joint experience with Boots at the beginning of the new century, but the company ended up after a dispute to distribute profits from the pharmaceutical company's properties in the supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 Celesio's property owned by Lloyds Pharmacy for 125 million pounds three years ago.
From there they claim Lloyds will play a role in the plan, ensuring the rich range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, director of the Sainsbury trade, made the following statement: “We have transformed the nature and nature of our beautiful shops to improve the overall survival of our customers.
We have also invested in special training of our colleagues who will offer professional advice on the site.
Our proposal of a range of brands aims to respond to every taste and all necessary in a pleasant setting, as this combination turns us into an attractive destination for wonderful products, which leads to the same old-fashioned way of marketing."
Peter Jones "bessen" after Holly Wilby's cancellation of an 11 million-pound deal
Dragons De Peter Jones' star "has gone mad," after television leader Holly Willowby refused to trade 11 million pounds with his elevator company to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Wilby doesn't have time to mark home devices and accessories Truly.
The couple's business is similar to the Goop brand of Guinette Poltrou.
The 37-year-old leader of "This morning" announced his leaving in Instagram.
Holly Wilby left the stars of Dragons Den Peter Jones "to kiss", after they got out of their income business with the brand of lignite products in the last minute – in order to focus on their own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones "has become angry" when "the gold girl" of television was admitted during a further meeting on Tuesday at the center of his business empire in Marlow, Bukingamshire, that her new contracts – at a value of 1.5 million pounds, mean that there will be no more time for his brand of domestic products and accessories Truly.
The business was attracted to Goop's brand of Guinnet Poltrou, and the audience was that he doubled Wilby's wealth, which was estimated at 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Wilby announced in Instagram leaving Truly, Jones left Britain with a plane to go to one of his holiday properties.
One source shared the following: “Truly was definitely Holly’s highest priority.
She was expected to be her long-term commitment to secure her future over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave things completely unpredicted.
No one believed that this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
There is a warehouse in the centre of Marlow, which is full of waiting products to be sold."
Experts believe that withdrawing the leadership of "This morning", which is one of the most successful stars in Britain, could cost the company millions because of large investment in products ranging from capital and candles to clothing and household products, as well as could lead to fun in placing a brand on the market.
And not in the last place, it can also mean a long friendship.
Wilby, who has been the mother of three children, together with his wife, Dan Baldwin, is a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Kap for ten years.
Wilby himself founded Truly with Cap in 2016, as Jones, 52, joined the company's president in March.
Two families often go for vacations together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV company.
Wilaby will become the "post" of the brand for M&S and will also replace An Macparlin as the leader of the transfer "I am significant" on ITV.
The source, who is close to Jones last night, made the following statement: "We won't comment on his business."
Severe negotiations leading to "relationship"
He is concerned about the criticisms that would come from the press channels for the launch of a comment that someone would consider "not appropriate for the president" and that was too positive for North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded in his "newary" way.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting, after the first one was held in Singapore in June and was announced by Trump as "a major step towards the elimination of the nuclear weapon in North Korea".
But negotiations to remove this weapon are standing.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Riya Young Ho reported to UN General Assembly representatives that North Korea "does not see a reciprocal relationship" from the United States to the first steps of its country on the way to disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
Trump presented in his speech a much more optimistic view of things.
"Our relations with North Korea are wonderful," he noted.
"We were on our way to war with this country.
They're gonna kill millions of people.
Instead, we now enjoy wonderful relationships."
The president said his efforts to improve his relations with Kim resulted in positive results – ending the rocket tests, release of prisoners, and returning to the US military body.
He also protected his inortodoxal approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It's extremely easy to act as president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this precipitated area, we would have about 200 people right there," Tromp said, cutting the crowd in front of us.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia leave the island and lead to hundreds of deaths.
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were declared to be unnecessary.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population were forced to leave their homes, a national disaster was not announced, which is a requirement for the initiation of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases there is an undisputed opinion that international assistance is not required, which makes things easy to challenge," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While "Save the Children" is a team to go to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate in the country's territory.
The national spokesman for the disaster agency Mr. Sutopo said that the Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies can contribute to recovery efforts.
Taking into account persistent earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unpredicted for such natural disasters.
Although refuges were built in the Ache, they were not often found on the other shores.
The apparent lack of warning cheese for tsunamis in Palo probably contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make this logic even more difficult.
Recently stationed in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake, the hospital ship has sent to Palu, but it will take at least three days before it can reach the location of the new disaster.
President Joko Widado turned the improvement of the remaining infrastructure of Indonesia in the centre of his campaign, investing large amounts of resources in roads and railways.
But the lack of funds is constantly corroding his office as Joe re-opens his urine over the next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with swords, spears and arrows as well as other early weapons.
Look: Daniel Stirj brought a late equality for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Stridge saved Liverpool from losing in the High League against Chelsea with a bullet in 89 minutes this Saturday at Stafford Bridge in London.
Stirj was given by Jerdan Shakyri about 27-28 meters from Chelsea's door while his team was at 1-0.
He put the ball on his left foot and then sent a precise shot to the far corner of the door.
The ball flew over the penal field and headed to the top right corner of the network.
She moved to the plaza of Cape Arisabalaga and complained about the lack of security in the network.
"I tried to take a good position to run the ball because players like Shak always seek forward positions, so I just tried to win as much time as possible for a good shot at the door," said Stirj before LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante doing it, I blew my ball, and I just shot without much thought."
Chelsea took from 1 to 0 in the 25th minute after the fall of her Belgian star, Eden Asar.
The attacker of the "sins" gave five to Mateo Kovačic, then printed from the middle of the ground to the half of Liverpool.
Kavachich exchanges fast double-entry in the center.
Then she let a quick shot of a gun, which led to Asa’s taking a clean position in the penal field.
Asar is watching the defenders and marking the left foot in the far corner near Liverpool's door, Alison Becker.
Liverpool will rise against Naples at the Champagne League's group stage at 15:00 this afternoon at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
The next opponent of Chelsea will be Videoton in the League of Europe of WEEFA at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths from tsunamis in Indonesia grew to 832
The number of deaths after the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia grew at 832, as reported by the country's disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people were caught in a trap between the ruins of the buildings, gathered after the earthquake with a magnitude 7.5, which struck the country on Friday and led to waves of up to 20 feet, reports the news conference to the agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The city of Palu with more than 380,000 people is ocessed with dissipated by the sirens built.

Cromwell's parliamentary status is transformed into the latest memorial hit by "recording history"
Its prohibition will be poetic justice for its almost Taliban destruction of so many of the English cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fantastic Puritan followers.
Ala "Cromwell's Community" described Mr. Crick's proposal as "best" and "recording history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Community, said: “We were not going through this debate to remove Oliver Cromwell's articles until the Westminster Court came to an end.
The iconophobia of the English civil war was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be turned into a victim because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the past century.
The great presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tornikrovt is evidence of the opinion in the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many still consider worthy of respect.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromoel is considered by many, perhaps even more than 19 centuries ago, to be a defender of Parliament against external pressure, of course, in his case it is monarchy.
Whether this is exactly the idea is the subject of an endless historical debate.
What is sure is the middle of the 17th century conflict that has shaped the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person, which represents a part of the growing division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve recognition and honor."
Prasse killer hurts a mortal Chinese farmer.
Farmer was attacked and killed by market dust in southern China, reports local media.
The man, who was only identified by his family as Yuan, was found dead with the interrupting artery and covered in blood near the market corner of Lipansui in the province of Guayjou, reported on Sunday in South China Morning Post.
The Swedish has been preparing to inject with vaccines his press release on May 30, 2005 in Sinin, China, Province of China.
It is assumed that he arrived with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 piglets on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he opened the door to his neighbor's kitchen.
He also reported that there was a big man in the kitchen with a blood clot.
The medical expertise confirmed that the 550-pound dust had been attacked by a deadly farmer, reports the report.
"My brother's feet were bleeding and confused," said Brother Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
A security record shows how Yuan goes to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his press.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal killer did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader reported to Evening News that the press was closed so that he could not attack anyone else while the police collected evidence from the crime scene.
It has also been reported that Yuan's family and market leadership are negotiating for the death penalty.
Even though they're rare, they've been reported for the pigs that attack people before.
In 2016 the psse attacked her wife and her husband at their farm in Masachuzets, and after the attack the man was with critical injuries.
Ten years ago, the 650-pound pig caught a Welsh farmer to his tractor while his wife managed to chase him.
After eating their own piglets in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to CBC News that the piglets are usually not aggressive, but the taste of the blood can be regarded as "loss".
"They're just playing.
The broadcasts are like little children, extremely loving... they don't intend to hurt anyone.
But a man must treat them with respect," the man concludes.
The weightless hurricane Rosa will bring honor and rain to the southern part of the United States
According to the weather forecast, hurricane Rosa loses weight as it moves over the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days Rosa will bring water to the waters in northern Mexico and the southern parts of the United States.
Rose includes 85 miles in power, which is a hurricane of category 1, considered to be 5 hours in the morning morning and is 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that on Sunday Rosa will move north.
At this time, over the Pacific begins to form a synchronous, which moves east to the western coast of the United States. As Rose approaches the island of Baha California on Monday under the shape of a tropical storm, it will begin to emit the tropical effect deep north to the southwestern part of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico.
In the next few days, the tropical atmosphere, along with the nearby synchronous, will create frequent heavy rains in the southwestern.
At local level 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid flooding, bringing out streams and possible leaks in the desert.
The deep tropical position will lead to the flow from 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the south-west it is expected to be from 2 to 4 inches of rain, especially over most of Arizona.
It is possible that there may be light floods in rapidly worsening conditions due to the dispersion of tropical rain.
It's gonna be extremely unpleasant to travel a hat in the desert when there's a threat of tropical rain.
The heavy rain can turn cannons into hot rivers, and the hormonal storms will bring up dust and clean winds.
The nearby synchronous will lead to heavy rain in some parts of southern California.
It is possible to get to a drop from more than half an inch, which will lead to a short drop of streams and smooth roads.
This will be the first wave for the ice season.
In the late week and early Monday, cloudy clouds bearing their tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona before the rain covers a larger area on the late Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread over the four angles on Tuesday and will continue until noon.
In October, it can bring large temperatures in the United States as the Arctic Ocean cools, but tropicals remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the short distance temperature.
There is a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central part of the United States.
There's about 20 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Misuri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moin, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer rain will try to rise and expand.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm beginning in October, and from the south to the north, temperatures are expected to exceed about 80 degrees.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast of time shows a high likelihood of temperatures above the middle of the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Bret Kavanau's hearing
More than 20 million people were watching on Thursday by six television networks the attractive age of testimony to the nominations of Supreme Court Bret Kawanau and Christine Blaysy Ford – the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which occurred in the 1980s in the 20th century.
The political opposition continued at that time, as the networks interrupted their regular return programmes in the last minute of Friday: an agreement concluded by Arisonian Senator Jeff Fleck and the FBI should conduct a one-week investigation on charges.
Ford told the Senate's Justice Commission that she was convinced by 100% that Kawanau had been pressured to drink and tried to take off her clothes during a high school purchase.
Cavanau, in his absence of emotion, is absolutely categorical that such a thing has not happened.
It's probably even more than the message from Nielsen number of 20.4 million observers to have seen the witness on Friday.
The company has counted the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no directly available data for the other networks that were broadcast the hearing, i.e. PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has traditionally experienced difficulties with measuring the number of people who look at their jobs.
By comparison, we're talking about a audience like that of this champion football game or Hollywood prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kawanau's appointment, is the first of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the afternoon hearing, reports Nielsen.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to the report by Nielsen CBS, there were 3.1 million, 2.14 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million and CNN – 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Fleck was the central figure in the fifth drama.
After the measured Republican office announced that it would vote in support of Kawanau, CNN and CBS cameras stopped on Friday as protestors were trying to capture the opportunity to meet the Justice Commission.
During the whole storm for a few minutes, he did not raise his eyes from the ground which was released alive on CNN.
"I'm right here, standing in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's introducing the truth to the state?
"You have power while many women are completely helpless," the attacks continued.
Flyk said that they had already come out of his office with a declaration and before closing the elevator doors, he reported that it would occur further during the hearing of the Commission.
The cables and exhaust networks ensured full coverage of live hours later, when the Judicial Commission had to decide whether to transfer Kawanau's nomination to the full Senate for vote.
Ala Flek reported that he would do this only if he was sure that the FBI would review the charges against the nominations in the following week, for which the Democrats object.
Flyk was partly convinced by talks with his friend, the senator of the Democratic Party of Chris Kuuns.
After a conversation with Kuuns and several Senator Flek made a decision.
His choice was crucial, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Cavanau without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Cavanau.
British Prime Minister May blames criticisms in "political games" with Breszit
Minister-President Teresa May accused her plans to leave the European Union in "political gambling" with the future of Britain and undercover national interests in an interview with Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May has arrived at the conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the first page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson intensified his attack on her so-called "Plan for Women's Game" for Brazil, offering that the collection of military taxis from Britain for the EU and the reverse is "completely absurd".
Weid Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Ditian Simpson for the death of a LSU player
The police are under arrest for the final fatal shooting at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Dickin Simpson, in his 20s, was arrested and jailed for murder at the second level, reported to the police department in Baton Rouge.
The officials presented a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, as reported by the police that Sims lost his glasses during the war.
The police have discovered the eyes of the place and they have also discovered Simpson's DNA, reports from the CBS WAFB branch.
After Simpson's investigation, the police told him he recognized the fatal shooting against Wade.
His guarantee is set at $350,000, notified by Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Justice Service publishes a preliminary report on Friday, in which the cause of death is mentioned as a fire wound, affected the head and the neck.
The administration expressed its gratitude to the police station for the release of refugees from the Louisiana State Police, the police station, the Southern University police, and the local residents of the investigation aid that has contributed to the arrest.
LSU director Joe Aleva's athletic sport thanks to local law enforcement authorities for "modern justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot and 6-inch player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played the LSU team basketball.
In the middle of the last season, it reached 5.6 points and 2.6 risks of the game.
On Friday morning, LSU Wyade's basketball coach reported that the team was "screamed" and "in shock" after Wade's death.
Wade said, "This is something that worries a man all the time."
Volcano spreads pepper over Mexico City
The ashes from the volcano Popocapetel pepper reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre has warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after the activity in the crater has increased and 183 gas and pepper emissions have been registered in the last 24 hours.
The center's been monitoring a lot of noises and traumas.
Social networking images show a thin layer of dust covering the front of cars in some of Mexico City's districts, for example in Hokimilko.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 km) south of the capital since the earthquake with Magnitude 7.1 hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police in close contact with Catalan separatists prior to the Year of Independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after the independent protestors broke up with the genocide, when thousands joined in opposing demonstrations to mark the first year of the polarising war to defeat Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the Jandarmerie, began to destroy the guards of peace with eggs and paint dust, thus creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets that normally creep from tourists.
Later in the day, other police caught up with the police, and the police fled to their palaces to take control of the situation.
For hours, groups of support-independent groups shouted, "We don't forget, we don't forgive," while the country's declarations of preserving the integrity were rejected with "Spain forever".
The local press reported that as a result of protests, fourteen people received medical assistance for minor injuries.
The tension remains high in the desired independence region even a year after the holding of the October 1 referendum was considered illegal by Madrid but replaced by separatist-oriented catalytics.
The vast majority voted in favour of independence, even though the activity was low, as most opposition to the withdrawal were blocking a referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the conduct of the vote in the voting sections in the region with a number of storm attacks.
The groups wanted independence spent the Friday night on the street to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration was in progress, but it was forced to move on a different route.
Narciss Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, joined in separatist protests with his wife, says she no longer hopes for the opportunities of Catalan to gain independence.
"Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy when they could vote, but now we seem to stand up," added the man.
Despite the marked important victory, this was a little different from the regional elections in the last December, which supported the independence of the Catalan political parties were experiencing difficulties this year, since many of their most famous leaders are either in self-defence or have been arrested for waiting for their role in organizing a referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Piug, a 42-year-old mechanic who wrote on his phone a protest in support of the police, claims that the conflict has been caused by politicians and both sides.
His comment is that "it's getting more and more excited."
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine arrested Catalan leaders, awaiting a preliminary process last year, announced that they would be candidates for the European Parliament's elections next year.
He claims that "my candidate for European elections is the best way to counter the regression of democratic values and pressures we observe by the Spanish government."
Londoners: Arrested men after the car broke into the house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39, respectively, were arrested, after a car broke down several times at home in Londoners.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 19:30 British time.
Detective Bob Blamings said there were charges on both the gate and the building itself.
It's also possible for the car to be shot by an ambulance.
Menga's goal is to win Livingston with 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Menga's First Ball for Livingstone Guaranteed the Victory
The novel in the High League Livingstone surprised Reingers and brought Stephen Gerard's second loss in his first 18th match as the manager of the Aybros club.
Dolly Menga's head became decisive, and Gary Holt's team was equal to the second point in the Hibernian classification.
Gerard's team remains unconquered on a foreign field in the High League during this season, and the following week it's against Commander Harts, who stands out with eight points in the ranking.
But before that, Rangers was hosted by Rapid Vienna in the League of Europe on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is already in a series of six games without losing the first, and Manager Holt hasn't felt the taste of the loss since he changed his post to Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed good opportunities against the homeless
Holt's team was supposed to lead to the result far before he noticed the goal, and his direct game style was extremely difficult for Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried the defense, but his attack came up after Alan Litgou shot at the wall, after Craig Halket returned the ball with his head to him.
The housekeepers let Rangers play the ball, knowing that they could seriously trouble guests from static situations.
And that's how it got to the winning goal.
Rangers committed a violation, and Livingston played well, as Declan Galler and Robinson combined and reported Menga, who took the ball and marked it from the middle of the penal field.
By this time, Rangers had control of the ball more, but they had broken down with the inevitable protection of the housekeepers, and returning Lim Kelly rarely had to get involved.
This style of the game continued during the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to do rescue.
Reingers' return saved Scott Pittman's foot shot, and the hit with Littleu's head passed through the door after another static situation for Livingstone.
In Livingston's penal field, however, the centers were easily cleaned, and the judge twice did not respect the claims of the guest for a dospa – first after a dispute between Halket and Glen Middleton's reserve, and then with doubts about the game with hands.
"Fenonmental" by Livingstone – Analysis
Alsadair Lamont from BBC Scotland on Tony Macaroni Arena
It's a fine game and a great result for Livingston.
The team is just playing out, continuing to go beyond expectations and to improve its presentation.
The style of the game and the composition were almost unchanged after the team was returned to the High League, but Holt deserves much praise for the way he transformed the team after his appointment.
He's got real heroes on the ground.
Captain Halket was incredible, organizing protectively, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warl under pressure.
At the same time, Rangers showed nothing inspiring.
Under the direction of Gerard, you're shown some wonderful things, but in the case they were very under these standards.
They were missing their last dog before the cave, only once they managed to break home protection – this loss must wake up Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the classing.
Erdogan gets mixed receptions in Cologne.
On Saturday (September 29th) we became witnesses to smiles and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship is cold because of human rights problems, freedom of the media and acceptance of Turkey in the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Kyle to find a huge new Jamaica.
The city is home to the largest group of Turkish people living outside Turkey.
From security considerations, the police prevented a 25,000 crowd from meeting in front of the commission, but the fire was surrounded by many supporters who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds protesting against Erdogan, many of whom the Kurds also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan's own policy and the German government's decision to allow it in the country.
The various protests reflect the confusion caused by a visitor who is accepted as a hero by some German Turks and at the same time is perceived as the disappointment of others.
Road accident in Deptford: The passenger rest after a car crash
He died after a car crash in London.
The catastrophy got close to the peak of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a train station in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, about 10:15 in the morning British time.
The driver of the car stopped and came to medical assistance, but the driver died on the spot.
The disaster took place a few months after another passenger died, after being shot by a fugitive driver at Children's Street, located about a mile away from the scene of the Saturday disaster.
The capital police reported that her officers were working on the identification of a man, after which they would inform his relatives.
The road is closed and bus lines are turned off, and motorists are also advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartine Prison: Six supervisors are injured in the accident
Six prison guards were injured in a man prison with a high level of security, reported by the Prison Service.
The murder broke out in Long Larsin prison in Warchester near 09:30 a.m. British time per week and still continues.
In order to manage it, special staff from the "Tordano" team will have to deal with eight persons deprived of their liberty, as the case is limited to a prison wing.
The injured supervisors have taken medications on their faces and have received medical assistance at the site.
A spokesman for the Prison Service made the following statement: “Specially trained staff are called to deal with the incident in Long Lartine prison.
Six supervisors have received medical assistance.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and we make it absolutely clear that the responsible persons will be handed over to the police as soon as their courts can be held."
There are more than 500 inmates in Long Lartine prison, some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that after an attack by a prisoner, the director of the prison had to be treated in the hospital.
Also in October last year, police officers from the peacekeepers were sent to prison, where they were to have a severe beating, where the staff was attacked with wild balls.
The Uragan Rose threatens with a bright flood of Finix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although the frozen areas may be useful)
Arizona rarely happens to be hit by a tropical storm, but there is a great likelihood that this will happen soon next week, as the weightless hurricane Rosa carries through the desert of the south-west, leading to its risk of light floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already established posts against the lights of Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, in southern and eastern Nevada, eastern California and Uta, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will take a different route over Finnish Tuesday, which will bring rain on Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix in Twitter noted that “only ten tropical cycles have been maintained in the course of 200 miles of Finix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of Arizona's border."
The latest models from the National Emergency Centre provide 2 to 4 inches of water with isolated quantities up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west desert, including the Central Scalers Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, as in some places it is possible to reach 4 inches of crossings.
For those who are not afraid of light floods, the cause of Rosa rain can actually be a blessing, as the region is severely affected by drought.
Although the floods are extremely serious, part of the rain is likely to be useful, since the southwestern part is now dry.
According to the Commission on the monitoring of the dry periods in the United States, a little over 40% of Arizona suffer from at least excessive drying, which is the second by weight category," reports weather.com.
First, the route of Urgana Rosa leads to the drying of the coastal island of Baha California in Mexico.
Rose, which can still be praised in the morning with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is located at 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north with 12 miles per hour.
The bridge meets with colder waters over the Pacific Ocean, and this is why it's losing weight.
Therefore, it is expected to reach the dry in Mexico with the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain above part of Mexico can be strong and can lead to a significant risk of overheating.
"Summer rains are expected from 6 inches from Baha California to the north-west Sonora, as possible to 10 inches," reports weather.com.
Then Rosa will be sent north through Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching Arizona's border tomorrow morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona in southern Yuta until Tuesday evening.
"The main risk of Rosa or its consequences is extremely strong rain in Baha California, North-West Sonora and the desert south-west of the United States," warns the National Centre for hurricanes.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening flooding and bringing various waste streams into the deserts as well as to sludge in the mountains.
Attack in Midsammer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of an attempted murder, after a 16-year-old child was found with injuries from rape in Samersett.
The wounded boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsammer Norton about 04:00 in the morning British time on Saturday.
It's happened in a hospital where his condition remains stable.
During the night in Radstock, a 17-year-old boy was arrested, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man who reported to the police in Avan and Samersett.
The police are asking everyone who may have decided what happened to them to contact them.
Tromp says Kawanau "has suffered from the pride and anger" of the Democratic Party
"Every vote on Judge Kawanau is a vote that rejects the cowardly and humiliating tactics of the Democratic Party," said the trumpet at a rally in Wiling, West Virginia.
Tromp said Kawanau was "lost by the depth and anger" of the democratic party during his nomination.
Cavanau testified before the Congress on Thursday, categorically rejected Christine Blaise Ford's sexual assault charge decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also witnesses during the hearing of the charges.
The president made a statement on Saturday that "American people today have become witness to the intelligence, training and qualities" of Cavanau.
"Every vote in support of Judge Kawanau is a vote in support of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a real lawyer with a wonderful reputation in public service," said the president before the meeting a crowd of supporters from West Virginia.
The president directly views Kawanau's nomination as he spoke of the importance of Republican votes for the general elections.
"They leave five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
Even if I'm not a candidate, I'm actually also participating," Tromp continues.
"That is why I turn around and fight in support of the good candidates."
Trump noted that the Democrats have set themselves for the mission "to stop and oppose".
The first key here is expected to be carried out in the Kawanau Senate no later than Friday, as reported to CNN one of the officials of the High Representative of the Republican Party.
Hundreds die after earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of casualties
At least 384 people lost their lives after many were taken away from the coast by giant waves, when a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, the authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when at the feast the coast was moved by waves of up to six feet (18 feet), brought many to their death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami is rising after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn't escape immediately, because many were victims of the disaster," said in a briefing at Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman of the Agency to combat the disasters of Indonesia BNPB.
"The water had taken its own car, the trees, the whole house, broke everything along its way," Nugroho continued, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at 800 km/h (497 m/h), before hitting the coast.
"Some people were trapped on the trees and thus managed to save themselves from the water," he added.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The photos published by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and stores, collected and removed bridges, as well as surrounded by water.
The secondary hurricanes continued to strike the coastal city on Saturday.
The number of earthquakes was felt in an area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) issued a declaration that the energy released from the fifth massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb left over Hiroshima during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographical location of the city, which is located at the end of a long and intense lake, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho describes the taxes as "grams" and specifies that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have been met.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of the buildings, the speaker added that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said that victims and victims could be higher around 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is closer to the centre of the stroke.
He also added that "the communications are completely blocked and there is no information from Donggala".
The Red Cross, on the other hand, indicated that more than 300,000 people live there, adding that his teams and volunteers have already moved to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can be even more difficult."
On Saturday, the agency was strongly criticised that it did not inform the injured Paul tsunamis, although the officials explained that the waves had arrived during the announcement.
Social networking fans show a man on the top floor of the building who shouts people on the street panic warnings for nearby tsunamis.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall is floating in the coast and it acts as a car, as well as a building.
Reuters has failed at the moment to release the owner of the clip.
The earthquake and tsunamis have brought a severe cut in the power supply, which is preventing communications around Palu and thus making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army started sending cargo aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities notified by the responsible authorities, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other products from first need.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue operations and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Pali on Sunday.
The people who died in the Indonesian tsunami are now over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision officials from Donggala have managed to safely reach Palu, where they have found refuge in the fireplaces of their offices, they have passed through a number of escape scenes, says Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they've seen countless destroyed houses."
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the initial work on rescue and recovery operations of emergency groups, some complain that the rich have experience in such situations foreign rescuers are unable to reach Palu.
According to the Indonesian regulations funding, the dispatch of staff and supplies from abroad may begin only if the affected place is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"The economy is still at a regional level," said Aulia Ariani, a speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Since the government has announced that it is a matter of national disaster, we can accept international assistance, but they have not yet declared such a statute."
As Paul falls over the second night after the fifth earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of those who are still unconscious continue to look forward to a miracle and that their proximity somehow survived after natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the canal.
On Sunday the rescuers released a woman who was trapped under the ruins for two days along with her mother’s body.
Ghendon Subandano, the trainer of Indonesia's national parapolarism team, trained two of the missing parapolars for the Asian Presidency, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those arrested in the Capan in the Roa-Roa Hotel were his students, Mr. Mandhei added.
"As an adult in the parapolarism field, I carry my own emotional goods," he said.
Gendon recalled how in the hours following the news of the meeting of the Roa-Roa Hotel reached the parapolarism community, he was desperate to send messages to whatsApp to the trainers in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
However, instead of taking notes, the only response to his messages was one-only gray.
"I think this means that the messages have not been delivered," he added.
Stealers raise $26,750 during banking in Newport of Levi
On Friday morning, the thieves raised $26,750 from Brink's employee, who ordered a banknote in Newport, Levy, became clear from a press release from the police department in Newport.
The driver of the car opened up the bank in the entertainment complex and prepared to charge him with money, wrote Detective Dennis Macarty in the report.
While the man was busy, another man "he came running behind the back of Brink's employee" and stole the bag with money.
The Witnesses noticed many suspects running from the scene, the message continues, but the police did not indicate the number involved in the theft.
All who have information on the identity of suspects must contact the Newport police on the phone 859-292-3680.
Canie West: The rapper changes her name
Rapper Kanya West changed her name to Ye.
Along with the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: “Man, officially known as Canyon West. ”
West, 41 years old, has been wearing the compass of Yee and has been used as a title for eight of his albums, which was published in June.
The change interferes with his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
He changes the singer Ariana Grande into the show, who refused “for emotional reasons”, informs us of the show’s creator.
In addition to reducing his current professional name, West has previously claimed that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe that "yes" is the most frequently used word in the Bible, which means "you" or "you", shared West earlier this year while discussing the title of his album with the leading Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
The passage from Canyon, which means only one man, only to Him – which is an expression of good in us, evil, error, and everything.
The album is more reflective of our essence."
The rapper is one of the most famous in its sphere who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of names and names, including Puff Daddy, P.D. or Didi, but this year he announced his preference to the pseudonyms Louv and Brother Lew.
One of West's former staff, Jay Zy, also presented himself in a variant with or without a sword and/or main letters in his pocket.
Mexico's president swears not to use the army against civilians
New-elect Mexican President Andrés Manuel Lopes Obrador swore that he would never use military force, as the country nears 50 years of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday, Tlatelolko Plaza President Lopes Obrador promises "never use the army to pressure the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people, while left-wing student movements gradually spread between Latin America.
Lopes Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by ensuring monthly scholarships for students and discovering more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education lead young people to criminal gangs.
The United States must double funding for II development
At a time when China is becoming increasingly active on the development front of artificial intelligence, the United States has to double its research budget in this area, claims the researcher and developer of II Kay-Fu Loy, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was sent, after various calls from the US government made statements on the subject of II, although the United States does not have an official II strategy as a whole.
At that time China presented its plan last year: the country is trying to become number 1 from innovation in II to 2030.
"Seconding the IE Development Budget will be a good start, since all other countries are far from the US and are going to make the next IE gap," he said.
The duplication of funding may also double the chances of the next major achievement in the area of II to come from the United States, as Lee informs CNBC in the past week.
Lee, whose book "The IE Superpowers: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the chief executive director of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the largest IE companies in China – Face++.
Over the past 80 years at the University of Carnegie Melan Lee has worked on the II system, which has won the most successful street player in America, followed by the executive director at Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese clone of Google.
Lee gives the debt of previous federal technological events, such as the Agency's workshop on improved defence research projects, and asks when to be the next one, which will help to identify new visioners.
"Researchers in the United States often have to work well to win government funding," Lee pointed out.
"China's not taking academic leaders, but the corporations," the man says.
In recent years Facebook, Google, and other technological companies have hired university lights to work on II.
Lee further claims that changes in immigration policy can help the United States strengthen its IE programme.
"I think that scientists should automatically offer green maps to doctors on II," the man said.
The U.S. State Council announced its plan to develop an artificial intelligence from the next generation in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people from academic institutions like the way the National Science Foundation and other state organizations finance researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, explains Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Defence Ministry established a Joint Centre for Cultural Intelligence, which aims to include partners from industry and academic environments, and from the White House announced the formation of a Special Committee on Cultural Intelligence.
Also this month DARPA reported an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, more than $100 million is currently invested annually in the development of II.
Meanwhile, the United States legislative body, who wanted to establish a National Security Commission on Cultural Intelligence, has not noticed any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum this week whether the country's name should be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia. This is a step that would allow for a further decades of debate with Greece, which blocked Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is a region called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents allegations against its territory as a whole, forcing its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist-oriented opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said that he himself would not vote in a referendum, while his campaign for combating his doubts about whether the referendum would be able to achieve the minimum 50 per cent, which are required to recognize his validity.
The issue of the budgets is as follows: "Do you support NATO and the EU membership by adopting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change in the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the price deserves to be paid in order to achieve the entry of the formation after the collapse of the Yugoslav state of Macedonia into organizations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the yoke of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79-year-old Skopje citizen.
Although the referendum does not have a binding force, enough Members of Parliament have been able to comply with the result of it to such a extent that it already has a decisive burden.
To change the name of the country, two thirds of parliamentarians must vote for this.
The State Electoral Commission reported that there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, the electoral activity was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters visited the Urs.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gose Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen of the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son, Dusko, voted at a referendum in Macedonia on a change in the name of the country, which will open the way to joining NATO and the European Union, in Strumica on 30 September 2018.
Before parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavadarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and set up chairs in front of the parliaments, which were run by the boycotting referendums.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proud heads rather than through the service return," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the European Union."
Minister-President Zaev said NATO's membership would lead to Macedonia's investment needs, as unemployment in the country is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us, as more than 80 percent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he gave his own vote.
The State also stated that the positive outcome would lead to "the confirmation of the future of our people".
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Research publishes results from a study, which says between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in a referendum – which is under the necessary activity.
Another study, a piece of Macedonian television Telma, announced that 57% of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they'd vote with "Yes."
In order for the referendum to be successful, the electoral activity must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, this will be the first serious attack on the pro-western government policy since it won power over the last year.
Look: Serhio Aguero from Manchester City passes through the entire defense of Brighton and marks the goal
Serhio Aguero and Rahiim Sterling defeated the defenses of Brighton and brought Manchester City victory with 2-0 on the "Ethihad Stadium" Saturday in Manchester, England.
Aguero's play on his neck in 65 minutes seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine governor was found with a dog in the middle of the field.
He's got three guards from Britton before he prints the ball into the empty space ahead.
Aguero then comes surrounded by four players in green.
He walked around one of the guards and left behind the rest of the border on the command field of Brighton.
Then he put it on the left to Sterling.
The English attacker with one touch returned the ball back to Aguero, who, with his right leg hit the back of Briton Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his door.
"Aguero struggles with some contusions in his legs," reported before the reporters of City Pep Guardilla.
"We planned to play him about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky that she noticed a bullet right now."
But Sterling was the one who ensured the initial advance of the "heavens" in this match from the High League of England.
He's off in 29 minutes.
In the case of the Agooro Gol, he was given a deep supply in half of Briton.
He immediately left the left flag on Liroy Sane.
Sun went ahead with the ball, after which he found Sterling with a dog on the far side.
The attacker of the "heavens" managed to cut off near, just before the ball came out in the car.
Siti will be facing Hofenheim in a match from the Champagne League's group phase at 12:55 on Tuesday afternoon at Rain Necar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Chercher wants to play certain Rockies fate
After the Nationals didn't class out for the playoffs, there's no special sense for another game of a titled beginner.
And yet, the ambitious Chercer is always hoping to be a titler on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, if the game is of importance to Rockies, who run a fight in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the classification of NL West.
Rockies guaranteed their participation at least in the "Wild Tatar" game after winning 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday evening, but it's still not sure that they will win their first title in the division.
"Although we ourselves do not fight for anything, we want to finish the season with a good match in Denmark, where the public and the other team will give everything to themselves so that they can win the most important match for them during the year.
Why would I want to miss such a fight?"
Nationals haven't yet declared a beginner for a week, but it is assumed that they will allow Chercer to participate if the game is decisive.
For Sherzer, this would be the 34th of March as a starting pizzar this year, as he held the training on Thursday and would have the normal time to rest for a week.
Washington's right-hand pizzar has a balance of 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 strands in 220 2/3 induction during this season.
Trump collects supporters in West Virginia
The President of Kosovo pointed out the situation with his electorate for Supreme Court Bret Kawanau, while speaking about the importance of Republican votes in the general elections.
"In November, everything we have achieved will be at risk.
They leave five weeks to one of the most important choices in our life.
This is one of the biggest moments in today's history – I also declare that although I'm not a candidate, I'm actually also involved, that's why I struggle with all the strengths for the right candidates," Tromp said.
Then he continued with “All you see this scary radical group of democracies, you see them with your eyes.
They're determined to return their authority in any way, you're themselves witnesses of their innocence, of their wickedness.
They don't care when they can hurt who they have to pass, to get into power and control, because they're interested only in power and control, we're not going to give them."
Democrats, according to the president, have set their goal to "stop and oppose".
"What we all see in the last four days," he continued, calling the democracies "heavy, poor, poor and faithless."
The President reminded the Senate Justice Commission, referring to the Senator of Democrats Dayan Fynstein, which caused strong reflections from the crowd.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you distribute documents?
Please, what?
No, no, I've been waiting – it was really violent – maybe the worst I've ever seen.”
The librarians are no longer extensive.
The party is not tolerant to those who speak openly.
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to censor me, they were little surprised.
In the end, I am just the last member of the parliament of the librarians to whom it was said that it was not good to come – just because I speak openly.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, had such a relationship, since he was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censor criticizes me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironically similar to those with which Jeremy expressed disagreement during the time of previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Congregation report on Friday said that "we want to include all the congregations and be useful".
For most of my eight years as a local representative of the Liberians in Parliament, the Friday meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today's tone of most assemblies and promises for "light and moderate" policies have long been forgotten if they have ever been on the agenda.
It was increasingly evident that the different views were not tolerated in the Liberian party and that every opinion would be assessed on the basis of this as long as the party's leadership liked.
This began soon after Jeremy became a leader, while the colleagues I worked for before I thought that they shared similar political views began to expect me to make a resort and take positions that I would never agree with — whether on national security or on the single EU market.
Whenever I make public statements - no matter what I'm saying in fact - is followed by an all-absorbing threat in the social networks, where it is called for to call, reject the policy of moderately speaking, statements that I do not belong to the liberarians.
It's not just me.
In the interest of the truth, I have even brought more happiness from some of my colleagues, since comments about me at least are of the political nature.
I can only get excited about professionalism and the targetness of these colleagues who stand before sexist or racist subversives every day, without fear of them.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era in politics is how such attempts have turned into the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that the librarians must conquer a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer extended, as with every sign of distrust or change of the electoral rule, it is becoming more and more difficult.
In the last two years, I have received much advice to cut myself off, not to speak so much and that then “it will be all right. ”
But that's not why I got involved in politics.
Since I joined the Liberians 32 years ago as a student, driven by the government of Tacher, which through neglect has led to a literal loss of my excellent school, I have fought for better public services for those who need most of them — whether as a local councillor or as a minister.
I've never covered my political views, including during the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way by my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state is opposed to Brexit, it will harm households, companies and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the librarian leader.
But really my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of the librarians, or not: For me it is pride to serve you and I promise that no threats of rejection or political repression will prevent me from acting in a way that I consider best in protecting your interests.

Er 38-17 Melrouz: The Unconquered Airs in the Classification
Two late essays may have changed the medical final result, but there is no doubt that Er deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting game from the High League of Tennent.
The team is already focusing on classing, and only one of the 10 teams is without a loss to date.
Better protection and better use of opportunities proved to be decisive in the fight, from which trainer Peter Merche and his team can be very enough.
"I'm happy because the other teams tested us very seriously in the past games, and we're still without a loss," said Merci.
Robin Christi of Melrous said: "Her congratulations, they really used their positions better than us."
Grant Anderson's Esse in the 14th minute followed by a successful additional hit by Frasier Climo, carried Er forward in the result, but a yellow card for Scotland's national Rory Hughes, free to play in the game of Wariers, allowed Melrous to compete in the result, after Jason Baggett realized that he was followed by an unsuccessful additional hit.
The climate has increased the advantage for Er from a penalty hit just before the half-life, marking her after the solo action, and then implementing and additional hit, with which the result was 17-5 for Er's holiday.
But Melrose started the second half good time and Patrick Anderson's tail, followed by a successful additional attack on Baghdad, reduced the advantage of only five points.
It follows a prolonged stop of the game due to the heavy contusion of Ruard Not, which was brought to the nose, and after the re-emergence of the sword Er increased their progress after the horse of Stafford McDoual and successful additional attack on Climo.
Then Er Blair Mcferson's active captain got a yellow card and Melrouz again took advantage of his numerous advantage, showing strong pressure and realized his leg through Bruce Colvin, followed by an unsuccessful additional attack.
However, their hosts returned the spirit's presence and when Struan Hotchinson received a yellow card, after he picked Climo without a ball, from the follow-up punishment playing Macferson realized his horse with the help of Er's advanced offensive line.
Climo's been carrying out the extra hit, not long ago, after Kyle Roue caught David Armstrong's ball and pulled Gregor Henry's wings on the wing for the fifth leg of the house.
The star of Still Game seems to have turned to a new career in the restaurant business.
The star of Still Game Ford Kirnan appears to have been directed to a more direct and hot farm after it was found to be appointed as director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular transmission, which is also a scenarioist and one of the two stars together with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemfil.
The two said that the next nine season would be the end of the transmission, as if Kirnan was already planning his life after Craigong.
According to the official registers, he is the Director of the Affonymorn Limited.
The actor abstained from the comment, although a source from Scottish Sun indicated that Kirnan intended to be involved in Glazgou's "producing restaurant business".
"The sea is ours": the empty exit of the sea Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
The seamen are constantly patrolling the shores with such a seabed in La Paz.
There's an ocean son flag over public buildings.
The seabeds from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have been moved with the motto: “The sea belongs to us.
Our duty is to return it."
Throughout Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the loss of exits transferred to Chile after a 19th-century conflict, is still alive – and the call to sail again from the Pacific.
In fact, this hope is now stronger than ten years ago, while Bolivia is waiting for an international court judgment on 1 October, after five years of consideration.
"The force is in Bolivia, wherever it feels loyalty and unity, as the country expects a positive outcome," Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kalzilla said.
Many patients will see the fate of the international court of the large screen throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support Bolivia's demand and that, after decades of negotiations, Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the oceans.
Here Morales, Bolivia's charismatic local president, who is about to go to an isolated re-election battle next year, has also put a lot and a lot of court judgement on Monday.
"We are very close to returning access to the Pacific," Moralez promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the court's probability of making a decision for Bolivia's benefit is quite small.
The UN body located in the Netherlands has no authority to take Chile's territory and has decided that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice is only six months after the hearing of the last arguments indicates that the case is "not settled", says Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia's cause, the last four years may actually have hurt her.
"The problem with access to the ocean has been solved by the current government of Bolivia," Zarate says.
Then he pointed out that Morales' military rector was superior and that there was little good in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after a normal dialogue has been conducted.
Both countries do not support diplomatic missions in one place since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguew Weltze, Bolivia's representative in Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision would be taken very quickly.
According to him Monday, Bolivia will have “the incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relations with Chile” as well as the opportunity to “send 139 years of disagreement by benefiting both countries.”
Calzilla also rejected the idea that Morales – which continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – has used the problem of access to the ocean as a "political heritage".
"The pain will never give up its right to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The trial is an opportunity to see that we must overcome our past problems."
North Korea claims it will not continue with nuclear disarmament until it can't trust the United States
Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Young Ho says his country will never be able to access nuclear weapons first if it is not able to trust Washington.
Ri presented his speech on Saturday before the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during the meeting between the leaders of opposing countries in Singapore.
His comment comes after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the way to start the nuclear-free diplomacy again more than three months after the Singapore meeting with Kim Young Un from North Korea.
Rí called the "empty hope" the idea that continuing with the US sanctions and allegations of a declaration that would put an end to the Korean war would cause the North to fall on its knees.
Washington is not willing to agree with the declaration without Phenyan first to make a significant attack on the way of disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
Ala has a widespread scepticism that in Phenyan they are serious about their rejection of arsenal, which they consider to be the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenyan next month to prepare for the second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The fashion magazines in Paris reveal the latest list of massages that will soon be in fashion stores to you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or even completely block the sunglasses, you don't need to search any more.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered the gamma amazingly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection, which laughed the fashion podium during the fashion Week in Paris.
I caused quite a lot of non-practical shocks in Instagram during the summer, when designers sent the eyebrows of their creations to shake the community of fashion.
Valentino's exciting proposal was an extravagance flight hat with a very wide periphery that literally twisted the heads of the models.
The other too large accessories included jewelry, magic hat and even pineapple – they do not intend to keep warm on your head.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – at exactly the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colour masks had oral protective features and reminded not of the higher fashion than of Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs had a pumping crew in a complete set of snowhallows and glasses while the other seemed to be a step-by-step ice cap.
If you fall under such fashion trends, you're lucky.
The fashion specialists predict that huge hats will soon be sold on fashion stores near you.
The huge hats come almost after "La Bomba" – the broken hat with two foot periphery, which was seen on the heads of all – from Riana to Emily Ratikovski.
The cult to the extremely unpracticable hat, which took over social networks, led to the appearance of another huge design of the fashion podium – a fallen beach bag, almost as much as the wearer dressed with a bank model.
The bag of raffle with the color of the pasturage, with raffles and wrapped in white leather, was attracting all views of the article in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during the fashion Week in Paris.
The popularityist Luke Armitid told the F.C.C.: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer – after the designer made so much pressure, it will be difficult to ignore the search for drogabaratic accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic excellence, as this continues in 2018 with a further preliminary presentation of test results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sports disciplines, art, music and other public sciences.
With up to 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scotland Association of Independent Schools (SCIS), are trying to offer the best level of their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their future education, their chosen career and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector, which can establish and implement a personal learning program, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable in school.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone we understand a language, your words will reach him.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot read only English when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
We see from the results of this year's surveys that languages are the first to have the highest success for independent schools.
Overall, 68% of the students who have studied foreign languages have achieved high A.
The data collected by 74 participants in SCIS schools show that 72% of the students have achieved a Chinese A assessment, while 72% of the German students have 69% of the French students and 63% of those with Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland accept foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
At the moment, languages as an object of free choice by students receive the same relationship as natural-mathematic disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) both in and through the programmes of independent schools.
In 2014, the Commission on Employment and Working Skills of the United Kingdom conducted a study showing that, for reasons of difficulty in finding employees, 17% indicated insufficient language skills.
As a result, the rule of foreign languages becomes mandatory to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more jobs require foreign language control, which turns these skills into material in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if a person owns a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future, having such skills that remains for the rest of his life.
The opportunity to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a person who has multiple languages at a height before competition.
According to a study by YouGov among more than 4,000 full-time citizens of the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% did not have a foreign language sufficiently well enough to be able to carry out a language, as France was the only language, with up to two-digit percentages with a 15% indicator.
That's why investment in learning languages is important to children today.
Managing a number of languages, especially those of developing economies, will ensure that children have a better chance of finding a good job.
Every school in Scotland will be different from any language taught.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are more important for the United Kingdom in the future of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child has, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, as teachers will be specialists in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are strongly determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed in life regardless of what the future holds.
At present it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredibly important role in the future of a country, which requires this to be taken into account in the educational system.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered as "International communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
You need to do it.

Lebron will make his debt for Lakers this week in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for the fans who wait to see Lebron James's first fight with the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Lakers' coach Luke Walton said James would be taking part in the first round of the pre-trial training team against Danver Nogets in San Diego.
But it's still not clear how many minutes he's gonna play in two.
"It will be on the ground between one and 48 minutes," Wulton announced by Lakers' official website.
The reporter for Lakers Mike Trudel told Twitter that James would probably play a little bit of a fight.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for six matches from Lakers' pre-conventional training.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need anti-smokers to prepare for the new season," he said.
Mixing Tromp in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Tromp starts a series of pre-election minutes this evening at Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned Tromp's mitigation, which includes interruptions at famous places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By handing down the confirmation of his election to fill the position in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the forthcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, as the Republicans are afraid of losing control over the Congress when voting in November.
How long will the Trump party be held in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
The trip to Tromp in Wieling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19 hours, east time this evening on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see the trip to Wijling, West Virginia, below by dropping live on YouTube.
Trump will probably consider the hearings from this week for the nominations of Supreme Court Bret Kavano, in which there was tension over allegations of sexual misconduct that kept the Senate's confirmatory opinion for one week while investigating by the FBI.
The main objective of this series of motions, however, is to help the Republicans to collect energy for the elections in November.
As a result, President Donald Trump's campaign announced that these five minutes in the coming week are aimed at "activating volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control over Congress is so important to his programme that the president will visit as many states as possible and start a campaign season, filled with commitments," reports Reuters spokesman of the Tromp campaign, who refuses to be mentioned.
This evening, planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wiiling, may bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, the second trip to Trump will take place this month in West Virginia – the country in which it won more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Republican Patrick Morrisi, who is still in sociological research.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisi that the president has come to put pressure on the sociological studies," said Simon Heder, a politician from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
"Rayder Cup" 2018: The US team will fight to the end by keeping its hopes alive before the Sunday sun
After three consecutive sessions without an intrega "forsom" matches on Sunday afternoon, they might have brought what Rader Cop needed.
The change of the advantage in sport is quite a subjective concept, however, in which players believe freely, even more in contradictions like this.
So, which team is in a better position right now?
"They went six points, and now there are only four, so I guess we've got some energy," Jordan Spit said at the end of today's competitive day.
Of course, Europe has a advantage of four points at only twelve for distribution.
As Spit says, however, Americans have something else to show and their fans should not lose hope if we have to judge Spit and Justin Thomas's sports form, which they played together all day and each took three of the four possible points.
Spit shows a great form from the beginning to the end of every hole and is the true leader of his team.
The offensive voices of the fans were getting stronger as he progressed in the round, in which with a precise hit he compared the results in the fourth match, after he and Thomas had two hits after the first two holes.
His attack, which won their match at the 15th floor, was met with strong emotions that make us believe that everything is not really lost for the American team.
"It's important that you don't think about anything else and focus on your own game," said Spit.
That's all that leaves these players now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points from Spiet and Thomas in the last two days are French Molinarians and Tommy Flyted, the fearless heroes of the "Rader Cup" so far.
The strange but impressive couple from Europe won four of them, and they seem to have everything.
Molywood was the only couple who didn't make "bogie" on Sunday afternoon, but they didn't have "rich" either in the morning or in the afternoon.
These follow-up successes, as well as the way the energy between them and the enthusiasts, have confirmed the idea that they are players who will win a week and there will be no better pair than Flitwood and Molinari, which will bring Europe's potential victory as the sun goes over Le Golf National.
To prefer both at the same time to different holes.
The examples of European glory, however, proved to be a little too early.
Boba Watson and Web Simpson were quick to deal with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the "for ball" games in the morning while he was partnering with Alex Norren.
"Bogies" and two "devils" of the first nine holes put Spanish and Swedish into problems they failed to deal with.
But on Sunday's games, there's no other way to solve your problems.
"Foreball" and "Forsom" games are extremely interesting to look around because of the interaction between the two, the advice they exchange between themselves, and the way one strategy can tolerate changes at any time.
Europeans played a better team, and so they drew a significant advantage before the last day, but this session of the "forsom" game showed that the American team is also ready to fight until the last – something in which many people, especially in the United States, were strongly doubting.
Europe runs from 10 to 6 on the last day of the "Rader Cup".
Europe will have a solid advantage before the last day of the "Rayder Cup" after it led the US with 10-6 after playing the games of the "for ball" and "forsom" games on Saturday.
The inspiring duet, Tommy Flytted and French Molinary, started with two victories against the incredible Tiger Woods, with which their assets of the "Le Golf National" competition grew in four points.
In an attempt to bring back the trophies that lost Hazeltine two years ago, the European team of Thomas Bourne dominated tomorrow's "for ball" games over Americans who made a mistake after the error, and finally Europe won the series with 3-1 wins.
The U.S. showed more opposition to the "forsem" game, where two victories were won, but they failed to reduce the difference.
Jim Furic's team needs 8 points of 12 matches a week to keep the trophies.
Flitod was the first novelist in Europe, won four points, and he and Molinari, known as "Molyod", after this sensory weekend, won four points from his first four matches in the history of Ryder Cup.
After unequippedly playing Woods and Patrick Reid in the "forball" games, they were extremely motivated to win the Woods and American novelist Brian Dekambu with even more category 5&4 results.
Woods, who barely passed through his two games on Saturday, only from time to time showed signs of his genius, but so far there are 19 losses of 29 matches in the "forball" and "forsom" games, as well as seven follow-up losses.
Justin Rose, who received a break for the morning's "for ball" games, shares with Henrik Stanson in the "forsom" matches with the 2&1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copka – the number one and three in the world.
The European team, however, failed to enjoy a very pleasant, cold and uncluttered day in the south-west of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas returned the Americans' hopes, winning two points on Saturday.
They achieved a hard victory with 2§1 against Spanish John Ram and Jan Polter in the "forball" game, and later they returned to beat Polter and Rory Makillroy with 4&3 in the "forsom" meetings, although they lost the first two holes.
Only two times in the history of the "Rader Cup" has happened to the team to raise four points of deficit before the syndicates, and according to Furic's regulation, it will keep the trophies even at the same time.
After two consecutive days, however, it seems that their chances of returning a week are not particularly big.
North Korea says "there is no way" to be disarmed unilaterally, without confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea reported to the UN on Saturday that the continuing sanctions deepen the United States' mistrust and that the country is not able to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
At the annual General Meeting of the World Organisation, Ri Young-How said that in the past year there have been "significant measures of good will", for example, halting nuclear and missile tests, destroying the nuclear test facility and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see a relevant US response," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security, and in no circumstances will there be any way to put ourselves out of the country first."
While Rey expressed the known complaints of North Korea against Washington's "responsible" approach to the elimination of nuclear weapons in which North Korea would be rebuilt, as it took action, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject the foreign nuclear equipment as Phenyan did in the past.
Rei called for a joint statement by Kim Chen Unu and Donald Trump at the first summit meeting between the US President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work on "an integrated armament of the Korean peninsula", and Trump gave security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea is seeking the official end of the Korean war from 1950 to 1953, but the United States says that Phenyan must first abandon his nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed the calls to ease the strong international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US urges "first remove nuclear weapons" and increase pressure by sanctions to achieve their goal by force, and even protest against "the declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The realization that sanctions can cause us to fall on our knees is a meaningless dream of those who don't know us.
The problem is, however, that the continuing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention whether it was planned to hold a second meeting between Kim and Trump, for which the US leader stressed the UN earlier week.
Instead, the Minister focused on three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Ja-in over the past five months and added: "If the country concerned for nuclear disarmament was South Korea, and not the United States, the elimination of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula would not have been such a stop.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the orientation of North Korean rockets to the continental part of the United States is inevitable, after the "bad president" Trump called Kim "human rocket" on a suicide mission.
This year in UN Tromp, who threatened North Korea with "full destruction" last year, Kim commended his coach for taking disarmament measures, but said that there was still much work to do and sanctions must remain in force as North Korea removes nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump stressed that there was no time for this and said: “It doesn’t matter if we take two years, three years or five months. ”
China and Russia insist that the UN Security Council should reward Phenyan for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must be continued without delay until complete, final and confirmed nuclear weapons are carried out."
The Security Council unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to halt the financing of the Phenyan nuclear programme and ballistic missile programme.
Pompey met with Ri in the scrolls of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Phenyan again the following month to prepare for the second summit.
This year, Pompey visited North Korea three times, but his last trip was good.
He left Phenyan in July with the words that he had made progress, but only a few hours later, North Korea accused him of sending out the "aggressive demands".
At a meeting with Mun this month, North Korea promises to destroy a rocket object and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "the appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim told him that the "relevant measures" to which he was seeking are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted to achieve normalization of relations with Washington.
Students in Harvard at a school for sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year allows all students to sleep more in an attempt to explore the growing culture of learning "all night" with the help of caffeine.
The teacher found that students in the university number one in the world often don't even think about their own reasons for caring for themselves.
Charles Kaysler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a hospital specialist in Brigham and women's hospital, prepared a course he thought was his first in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after he talked about the effect of sleep loss on learning.
"Even a girl came to me and said, "Why are they telling me even now, in my last year?"
She said no one ever told her about the importance of a dream that surprises me," he said before The Telegraph.
The course, which takes place for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help academic and sports achievements as well as to improve overall well-being.
Paul Bareira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after it found out that students were suffering from a serious sleep loss during the week.
At the same time, the course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In part, there is a picture of a room in the community where students jump over coffee, teasing, maratons and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light, how sports achievements are affected by the lack of sleep, as well as the importance of sleeping routines.
On the other hand, participants are told how long-term sleep loss can increase the risk of heart failure, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then the map of the campsite with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know this will not immediately change students' behavior.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the health effects of the choice to smoke," adds Professor Kaysler.
The culture of pride of "learning all night" still exists, he says and added that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
The provision of adequate and quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students in the fight against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he says – even with the aim of avoiding filling, since the loss of sleep causes the brain in a hunger regime, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Kaysler prepare the course by taking one of his classes during his first year in Harvard.
He says his course "opened his eyes" and inspired him to spread it throughout the camp.
It is hoped that the next step is for all students to be asked to complete such a programme before joining the competition institution.
Professor Kaysler recommends that students consider setting up a bedtime and wake-up alarm and knowing the valuable effects of the "sin light", emitted by electronic screens and light-years, which can disrupt the circular rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Menga's goal broke Gerard's team
Reingers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's joke broke Stephen Gerard's team and won from 1 to 0 for Livingstone.
Aybrox's team wanted to record its first triumph as a guest of Triumpha in February 4-1 over St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team had barely won the second defeat of Gerard in his 18th fight as manager, who left his team with eight points less than the late Harts' team, leader in the High League of Ladbrokes.
Menga noticed seven minutes before the holiday, and the absence of the constructive ideas of the Rangers team at no moment seemed close to comparison.
After the game, Rangers got out of six, and Livingston's already three, leaving the second Hebrew only on his head.
For Rangers there may also be additional problems, as Side Judge Kalum Spence got a head wound after being hit by an object that was apparently thrown out of the guests' fans.
Gerard has made eight changes in the team, which has gravitated Er in the semi-finals of the Scotland League Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went out with Livingston's same segregator, who turned off a point against Harts last week, and should be satisfied with the way his aggressive team has been opposing all the actions of the opponent.
Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston did better in the rarest cases when they owned it.
They should've noticed again in the second minute, when Menga took out a touch with Scott Pittman against Mr. Alan McGregor, but the beneficiary missed a good chance.
Later, Kevin Jacobs found Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Litgou turned the ball away from the back of the fence.
Rangers took control of the game, but they couldn't create anything in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought there should be a hole in the 15th minute when he broke up with Stephen Loules, but the reporter Stephen Tomson rejected the claims of the Colombians.
The Rangers only launched two direct strikes in the first half, but the ex-trovert from Ibrox Liam Kelly was easy to deal with a hit with the head of Lasana Kulibali and the weak shot of this Ejaria.
Although Livi's fall in the 34th minute was amazing in view of the ball's possession, it was deserved.
Rangers couldn't deal with the depth of Jacobs.
Scott Archfield doesn't respond when Declan Galler sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who gave Menga cold blood for whom it was easy to realize.
Gerard reacts to the rest by changing Kulibali with Ryan Kent and this change almost immediately led to the result when the wing passed on Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out resolutely and blocked the attack.
Livingston, however, continued to urge guests to play in a comfortable way for the domestic style of the game, as Litgou and Halket constantly rejected the sent forward forwards.
Holt's team could've increased its advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor managed to deal with Jacobs' attack, and with followed by Coroner Litgou shot with his head next to the fence.
The entrance as a reserve of Glen Middleton from Rangers sought a hole at the end of both of them after a battle with Jacobs, but Tomson saw nothing wrong in the situation again.
Anniversary: Aggreviated Number Operator
Page of our journal Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, before 136 years and BROENE... the day the future physics Johan Wilhelm “Hans” Gayger was born in Germany.
Gaiger develops a method for generating and measuring radioactivity, which ultimately leads to the creation of the device, known as a gear calculator.
A huge stone in science since then has also become a rock of pop culture, when in 1950, the "Camps of Coronado" film, which was attended by apparently amazing students Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: “What God has yoked together let no man put apart. ”
Rogers: It's a hacker number and is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium..
When you put these sounds, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms assigned to radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans says, "I'm sure you're right now!"
Hans Gaiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name continues to exist.
New vaccine against cancer can train the immune system to "see" foreign cells
A new vaccine against cancer can train the immune system to "see" foreign cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of the treatment
The method includes removing immune cells from the patient and changing them into the laboratory.
Then they can see protein that is common to many types of cancer and are re-injected into the patient.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells has seen her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes the removal of immune cells from the patient and their transformation into the laboratory so that they can "see" protein, common to many types of cancer called HER2, and then re-inject into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofski of the U.S. National Institute of Oncology in Betezda, Meriland: "The results assume that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stimulates growth of several types of cancer", including breast, eggplants, white pellets and colorectal carcinoma, explained Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach to taking immunosuppression cells from patients and their “learning” to cancer cells has been used to treat leukaemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat with the title "Let's do America big again", while participating in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenya West was featured in the study during Saturday Night Live, after making an unexplained performance, in which US President Donald Trump said he would apply for president in 2020.
After completing his third night song called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the title "Let's make America big again", he announced against the democracies and declared his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people many times and they ask me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with Matt Deyman's participation, in which the Hollywood star is playing witness to Bret Kawana's testimony to the Senate Legal Commission for Sexual Violence complaints made by Christine Blaise Ford.
Although it wasn't released, West's performance record was posted on social networks by Cris Rock comics.
It's not clear why Rock tried to play West with his publication.
In addition, West complains before the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of his hat.
"I was tortured behind the culinary.
They said, "Don't come out with this hat."
I'm being tortured!
And then they claim I'm on a floating ship," he said according to Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see the floating ship?", asserting that he will wear Superman's suit because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try with love."
Comments caused at least twice the public reflections, and SNL team members seemed embarrassed, reports Variety, one of them said, "The whole studio was shut down."
West was invited at the last moment to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
It is a gift for many who perform the song “I Love it”, dressed as the button “Perie”.
West received support from the leader of the Conservative Group TPUSA, Candes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the bravest: BLAGODARY YOU HAVE BEEN TALPATED."
The director of the show, Karen Hunter, however, wrote on Twitter that West was just "he was himself and that's great."
"But I choose not to reward a person (to buy his music or clothing or to support his "art"), who I think is welcome and spreads an ideology that is valuable to society.
He's free.
We're like that," she added.
Before the show, the rapper reported on Twitter that he changed his name, "now officially known as Kenny West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows the example of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and Pi Didie.
His friend, Rapper Snup Dog was called Snup Linen, and the music legend Princes changed his name with a symbol.
Case of attempted murder after a knife in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of an attempted murder, after a man was armed with a knife in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, said by the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Magistrate Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the prosecutor.
The star of the "Gran A Trons" Kit Harington is against the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for the role of the devastating sword John Snow in the violent mid-term fantasy series of the NWO "Tron Game".
But the actor, who is 31 years old, complained against the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that showing such roles leads young people often to think that they should be "serious" in order to be respected.
In an interview about The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believes that "something's been wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxicity in #MeToo's garden.
Kitt, who recently married his partner from the "Tron Games" Rose Lesley, also 31 years old, admits that he feels "very confident" that this problem should be solved.
"At the moment I'm very confident – what have we been wrong with men?" he said.
"What do we learn from the growing men about the problem we see now?"
Kitt believes that television can sometimes be responsible for increasing toxicity due to many male personalities.
He continued: “What is it worth, and what does it teach?
What do you learn from the television and the street that makes the boys feel they need to turn into this particular guy?
I think this is really one of the big issues of our time – how do we change it?
'Cause obviously something's wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also acknowledged that he would not participate in the prehistoric or continuation of the "Trons Game" after the end of the series in the following summer, claiming that he had "closed with the warplanes and horses".
Since November, Kitt will be participating in Sam Shepard's "Resurrection of the True West", the story of film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor said that dating his wife, Rose, is the best thing that happened in the "Tron game".
"I met my wife in this series, so he gave me my future family and determined my life ahead," he said.
Rose plays Games, the girl in which Kit John Snow's hero loves, in the fantasy series, the winner of Amy's prize.
The two concluded marriage in June 2018 in the property of the Lesley family in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and back.
According to health services in the country, more than 820,000 people have been affected.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, some 40,000 new cases have been reported.
Most of the new cases are caused by sexual contacts that indicate changes compared with the past.
Traditional HIV is spread quickly in some parts of China as a result of the flow of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV this way is almost zero, said from the health services of China at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Nevertheless, each year the number of HIV and back users in China is increasing by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was demarinated in China in 1997, but discrimination against people in the communities of the KGB is widespread.
According to studies due to conservative values 70–90% of men who had sexual contact with men eventually married women.
Many cases of transmission of diseases are due to incorrect protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of the problem management efforts.
Maxine Waters refused to have data from senators from the Republican party, concluding "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, U.S. Chamber member Maxine Waters condemned the charges that a member of her team had published personal information from three state senators from the republics of the lawmakers' pages in Wikipedia.
The democracy of Los Angeles said the claims were made by experts and websites of the "ultra right wing".
"false, false and even disgusting lies," said Waters in a Twitter statement.
The information published includes the addresses and telephone numbers of the state senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orine Hatch from Yuta.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Capitolia during the hearing of the Senate's composition on sexual charges against the candidate for Supreme Court Bret Kawanau.
It's real, after the three senators asked Cavanau.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications is linked to the Waters office and provided information about its team member, according to Hill.
"This irrefutable claim is completely false and absolute lies," continued Waters.
“My team member – whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and false claims – is not in any way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This unfathomable claim is completely false and absolutely false."
Waters' statement quickly caused criticism online, including by the former Presbyterian of the White House Ari Flasher.
"There's a core in this denial," Flecher wrote.
"This assumes that it does not have a temperature suitable for a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be challenging.
I don't have to question the prosecutor's motives.
It must be peaceful and balanced."
Flasher compares Waters' reaction to criticism by Judge Kavano's democracies, who was accused of criticism, that he also seemed mad during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navaro, a candidate from the Republicans for Waters' place in the inter-elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Really, if it's true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had set up appropriate authorities and law enforcement bodies for these false claims.
"We will be sure that the performers will be discovered," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team."
John Inglesh's Revue – the weak Spanish family with Rowon Atkinson
It is already traditional to look for invitations to Breszite in every new film with British participation and it seems that this is important for the ex-Committee, Spanish for Johnny English – which starts with "Johny English" in 2003 and returned in 2011 with "Johny English returns".
Will the self-smoothing and the minics who say how obvious it is that we are stupid will turn into a new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, uncompetent Johnny Inglesh with a blind eye and a "gumme" person has the permission to repeat things for a second time – his name is the most important when it comes to a great comical creation, intended for readers of the cinema who do not speak English.
He, of course, is a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims for adorable blusc, has a little bit of Mr. Byn and a large part of the man who brought a note on the music theme Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In addition, it is initially based on the remaining chaos behind it as a traveling and international man who Atkinson plays in the already forgotten Barclaycard television ads.
The last movie with Johnny Inglesch has two nice moments.
I liked it when Johnny Inglesh approached a helicopter carrying a medieval armory, and for a short time the puppies ended up in his shoulder.
Atkinson's contribution to the physical comedy and obvious, but humor is quite weak and strange, especially when "serious" films brands such as "007" and "Mission impossible" include a dose of comedy.
Humort seems more direct to children than to adults, and Johnny Inglesh's minor abuses, I think, are not innovative and focused, as there is no actinson's memory of Mr. Byn.
The current assumption is that Britain is facing serious problems.
Kiberhacker has been hacking the British super secret network from spy and has discovered the identity of all operational agents for fear of the daily agent – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last chapter of the Prime Minister, which is a bold and bold figure and already suffering from a complete stream of political instability: Emma Thompson gives everything to himself for this quasi-Treza-May role, but the script has nothing to do with it.
Her intelligence consultants inform her that she should call a retired agent, since all active agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny Inglesch himself, who is currently working as a teacher at a crack-in center, but who teaches illegally how to be an agent undercover: there are some good developments here when England decides a Spanish rock academy.
England has been called up in Whitehol for quick training and meets again with its former long-term assistant Bo, re-played by Ben Miller.
Because he's already a family man, married to the manager of the basement, a happy role in which Vicki Pepperdin's talent is a little fragrant.
And so, Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the big problems of Her Majesty's secret services and get stuck with the fatal beauty of Ophelia Bouletova, played by Olga Curylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has fallen under the dangerous influence of charismatic technology billionaires who claim to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain: the violent Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacey.
England and Bo start their hair from the fascists: dressed as servers, they burn French restaurants; they create chaos when they walk on the luxury garden of Volta; and England causes real anarchy when they try to use a virtual reality helmet to recognize the interior of the Volta house.
All smiles are certainly taken from the previous film, but since there are so many sympathies and fights here, there's a lot more content for children.
A lot of media production.
Like other movies about Johnny Inglesh, I keep thinking, can't the British film industry give Atkinson a role that corresponds to his talent?
The librarians deny that the British plan to work four days a week, but to get five payouts.
Jeremy Corbin's liberarian Party is considering a radical plan, according to which British people work four weeks, but get five payouts.
The party claims that the heads of companies want to provide the economies created by the revolutionary artificial intelligence (III) to the workers by giving them another day of rest.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but to get the same pay.
The sources say that the idea would "pass" on the economic programme and the party's plans to disband the country for the benefit of workers.
The four-day work week transition has been approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
High source from the Liberian party said before The Sunday Times: “It is expected that before the end of the year it will be reported for policy review.
"It will not take place immediately, but the four-day work week is a stream that is part of the strategy to balance the economy for the benefit of workers as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Liberian Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promises a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this stream does not meet the approval of the entire Liberian party.
"Fourday work week isn't in party politics I don't think about it."
The Chancellor in shadow John McDonald used the Lebourists' conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said it was decided to take power back from "local directors" and "expectors" in municipal services companies.
Chancellor plans in shadow also mean that these owners of parts in water supply companies may not receive their entire share, since the Liberian government could impose "delays" on the basis of the established infringements.
In addition, he confirmed the plans to put workers in companies' boards and to create private funds to transfer 10% of net capital to private companies of employees who can group annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking 60 minutes ago whether the investigation of Cavano by the FBI can change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Bret Kavano has stopped the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the Bureau's findings could cause some of the senators from the Republican party to withdraw their support.
In an interview last week, the "60-minute" correspondent Scott Pelly asked the senators from the Republican party John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavano.
After the case, I called him and asked him, “Did you do that? ”
He was decisive, categorical and uncognizable."
But Graham's voice seemed uncomplicated.
"I have an opinion about Bret Kavano and to change what is needed to investigate the charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Bret called him a category," said Graham, turning to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one she was talking about, but she could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the "Global Citizens" festival, and does it help to reduce poverty at all?
This week, New York will be hosted by a “Global citizen” festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive composition of executives and is also performing such a impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the "Global citizen" festival will gather tens of thousands of people of the great sea in Central Park who will not only enjoy the fulfillments of Janet Jackson, Cardie Bi and Sean Mendez, but will also meet with the real goal of the event – the eradication of exceptional poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international protection group which hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to receive an event free ticket (except if you do not want to pay for the WIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or "actions" as voluntary participation, not sending to a world leader, telephone call or otherwise to help raise awareness about their objective of eradicating poverty.
But how successful is the Global Citizens for 12 years before they reach their goal?
Is the idea of repaying people with free concert is a genius to convince them to demand action or is it just another case of "clicitism" – people think they do something important when they sign an online petition or send a post on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizens have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from their supporters, who insist on many different objectives.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and communications arising from its actions, with at least $10 billion already being paid or collected.
The group believes that the insurance funds have already directly affected about 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include "The Power of Food", established in the UK partnership between investors and executives, commitment to "supporting children to develop their full potential", which promises Rwanda to provide $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after they have received more than 4700 posts in Twitter from "global citizens".
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn social injustice into a historical note just," said the Ambassador of "The Food Force" Tracy Ulman in front of a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were undertaken, which call on Britain to improve the food of mothers and children, the government has reported on funding a project, "The Power of Food", which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the CZVs on his website, asking, "Why do you think we can end the extraordinary poverty?"
“Global citizen” replied: This will be a long and hard time – sometimes we will fail and we will fail again.
But as with the great civil rights movement and anti-partite movement before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mendez, Cardie Bi, Janet Mona are just some of the executives of this annual event in New York, to which leaders will be Deborah and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use military forces to "block" and prevent energy exports – Minister of Internal Affairs
Washington may, if necessary, escape to its military forces to prevent the entry of Russian energy products into the markets, including the Middle East, revealed the US Interior Minister Ryan Zink as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zink claims that Russia's engagement in Syria – in particular, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a precedent for examining new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy as they did in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States can, through our military forces, guarantee that the maritime routes are open and, if necessary, block them so as to ensure that energy products do not reach the market," he said.
Zink turned to the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group of non-professional targets, which is presented as a "vote of energy consumers" in the United States.
He was about to compare Washington's ways of dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are the same.
"The economic option with regard to Iraq and Russia is, more or less, stimulating and replacing fuel," he said, while identifying Russia as "a single-number item", with an economy dependent on fuel-saving.
The statements come at a time when the Tromp administration has a task of strengthening the export of liquid gas for Europe, replacing Russia, which is a far more balanced option for European consumers.
To this end, officials in Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" pipeline project "Northern stream 2", which, according to Trump, turns Berlin into "an obstacle".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-dollar pipeline of North River 2 will double existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres is a clean economic project.
Cremell claims that Washington's open-ended opposition to the project is simply caused by economic reasons and is an example of illegal competition.
"I believe that we share the point of view that energy cannot be a tool for the exercise of pressure and that consumers should be able to select suppliers," Russian energy minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Minister of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has caused a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organization, the German Industry Federation (DBDI), called on the United States not to join EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third country mixes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angel Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look at the presidential candidate in 2020, says Senator Masachuzets.
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "look serious" at the presidential election after the inter-election.
During the City Council in Hollyoke, Massacutes Waron confirmed that I was thinking of applying.
"It's time in Washington for women to enter and repair our government and that includes a woman on top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take a serious look at the presidential candidate."
Warren expressed his assessment of President Donald Trump during the city council, saying that he "takes this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried about the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren was exposed in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for High Court Bret Kavano.
In a post on Twitter on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A sociological study carried out on Thursday, however, showed that most of the voters in Warren themselves do not think that it should be applied in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probably" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not apply, according to a study by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidate.
Social research has shown more support for the candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 per cent and 48 per cent against.
Other senior representatives of the Democratic Party, discussed with regard to potential candidates in 2020, include former Vice-President Joe Bayden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Bydon said he'd take an official decision in January, reports Associated Press.
Sara Palin pointed out the PTSR of Trak Palin's mitting for Donald Trump
Trak Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after writing in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday evening.
"What my own son is going through, after returning, is known to other families who feel the consequences of the PTSR and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming back with," she said in front of the audience of the rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they return a little changed, stolen, returned and wondered if they would get this respect, which they and their arms had given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, included in a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in a state of emergency, according to Dan Bennet, spokesman of the police department of Vasila.
18 States and surrounding Colombia support the opposition of the new asylum policy
The 18 states and surrounding Colombia support the judicial opposition to a new US policy that rejects the refugee status of victims of gangs and domestic violence.
On Friday, 18th representatives from the states and surrounding countries presented a request for goodwill in Washington in support of the asylum seekers and protesting policies reported by NBC News.
The entire name of the case "Greys v. Sessions" was not disclosed, which the American Union for Civil Liberties submitted to the federal policy in August.
She claims that her partner "and the sons of the violent members of his gang" abused her, but US officials rejected the asylum request on July 20th.
She's in Texas.
U.S. lawyers who help Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which come from a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, as nations facing comprehensive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. refugee policy in the area of asylum returned the 2014 appellant's 2014 asylum appeal board, which allowed immigrant documents running from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia District attorney Carl Rosin says on Friday that the new policy "ignores the decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law requires all asylum applications to be examined in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances, and such prohibition violates this principle," says a good-will report.
In addition, lawyers argue in the report that the policy that refuses immigrants' entry is worth the American economy, asserting that it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "to ensure the necessary working hand."
In June, chief prosecutor Jeff Seasons ordered judges on immigration cases to suspend the provision of asylum to victims fleeing from domestic abuse and gang violence.
"Escape shall be given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political belief," the Session said in its communication of 11 July on politics.
The refugee was never meant to solve all the problems – not even all the serious ones – before people get up every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate efforts to save in Palu while death cases double during the search for survivors
The situation for survivors is getting worse.
"I feel very excited," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, comforting her sick boy at an evacuation center in the abandoned city of Palu.
"Every minute the liner carries more bodies.
The clean water is pure."
The inhabitants are noted to return to their destroyed homes to try to save something from their alleged possessions.
Hundreds of people are injured, and patients affected by earthquakes with Magnitude 7.5 are filled.
Some of the sufferers, including Dvi Harris, who had endured back and back beatings, were outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients are treated openly because of continuing secondary injuries.
His eyes fill with tears when he recalls how he felt the terrible earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I think I was pressed into the destroyed wall," said Harris before Associated Press, adding that he came to the city with his family to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then she shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of "torms" with "propagand advertising"
One week after an official newspaper in China released a four-page announcement in the US Daily on the benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to China's paid publication in Des Moines Register – the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa – after he accused China of trying to intervene in the US Congress elections on 6 November.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to introduce the elections for the American Congress notes what American officials told Reuters that it is a new phase in Washington's scaling campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to issue commercial promotion ads, Beijing and Washington are currently participating in a scaled trade war, where they compare import rates between countries.
According to experts from the United States and China at the beginning of the trade war, the customs tariffs in China were intended to strike exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump.
Terry Branstad, an American Ambassador to China and former former governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods for China, said Beijing had killed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in a comment on the weekly number of Des Moines Register, "has now doubled this brake by placing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the respected tradition in America for freedom of speech and press, leaving a paid advertising in Des Moines Register," says Branstad.
"In contrast, on a newspaper stand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited statements and you will not see a true reflection of the various views that the Chinese people may have regarding China's worrying economic trajectory, meaning that the media are under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most famous Chinese journalists avoids the proposal to publish" his article, although it does not mention exactly who.
The Republicans protested women voting on the inter-elections, warning analysts
Since many of the high-ranking Republicans stand behind and defend the nominations for Supreme Court Bret Kavano for several sexual assault charges, analysts warned that there would be a response, especially from women, during the forthcoming internal elections.
The emotions about this are extremely strong and most Republicans have already noticed that they want to continue voting.
These things can't be returned," said Grant Raher, professor of politics at Maxwell University in Siracusa, in front of The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Rahir said he wondered whether the latest pressure of Senator Jeff Flek (R-Arizona) to investigate the FBI would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday – they won't forget it either tomorrow or November," said Karin Jean-Pierer, an senior adviser and national speaker for the progressive movementOn group on Friday, according to Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, protestors scheduled "November is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate corridor, as the Republicans controlling the judicial commission decided to continue with the appointment of Cavano despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Ford, told Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasts and motivations will be excluded," said news reporter Stu Rotenberg, a free political analyst.
"People say the problem is already serious; that's true.
But it can become even more serious, especially among electoral women in the front and younger voters, between 18 and 29 years, who often don't vote because they don't like the president."
Even before the public testimony of the Forum describing its sexual assault charges against the nominations of the Supreme Court, analysts assume that it may follow a response if the Republicans insist on confirming the application.
"This has turned into a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steel, former president of the National Committee of the Republican Party, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the vote of the committee, whether the final vote or whether Kavano is put on the scale. It is about how the Republicans deal with this and how they relate to it," said the press channel Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to choose democracy.
The Americans, however, seem to be divided in some way on who to believe as a result of the demonstrations of Ford and Cavano, a little more than a second.
A new sociological study by YouGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents believe in Ford's statements, and 35 per cent say that they believe in Cavano.
In addition, 38 per cent say that they think Cavano is probably lying or certainly lying during his show, while 30 per cent claim the same for Ford.
Following pressure from Fleck at the moment, the FBI is investigating the claims of Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Debra Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford's testimony under oath before the Senate's judicial commission that Kavano attacked her in a state of emergency when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed his genitals before her while they were at the party during her follow-up to Yale in the '80s.
The World Wide Web developer plans to launch a new Internet to attack Google and Facebook
The founder of the World Wide Web Team Burners-Ley is starting a initiative aimed at opposing Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend in the field of technologies, Inrupt, is a company that builds the platform with an open code of Burners-Ley Solid.
Solid allows consumers to choose where to store their data and people have access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company Burners-Ley, the purpose behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the beginning.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "on-line personal data" or POD.
It contains lists, lists of tasks, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available on every browser, and at the same time all of them are simultaneously.
The only thing that's unique in the online personal data store is that the user determines who's access to the information.
The company calls it "the right to personal data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the executive director of the company John Bruce, is the company to put resources, processes and appropriate skills in order to help Solid become accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Burners-Ley, Bruce, a security platform, a buy-in from IBM, several developers, concluded a project work contract, and a group of volunteers programmers.
This week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Ley said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change, or not when all their business models are fully renewed for one night.
"We don't want permission from them."
In a press release in Medium on Saturday Berners-Ley wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide trade and ecosystem energy to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the solid base.
In 1994, Berners-Ley transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technical Institute.
In recent months Berners-Ley has had a strong influence on the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Although running Inrupt, Burners-Ley will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era on the Internet," adds Burners-Ley.
Bernard Van: in the memory of a priest who was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I
100 years are marked in the home of the only English priest who has been awarded the Victoria Cross for his participation in war during World War I.
Colonel Bernard Van won the award on September 29, 1918 at the Bellenglesi and Lehacourt attack.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a rapist without knowing that he had been granted the highest military honours in Britain.
A remarkable monument was discovered on Saturday by his two grandsons, on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that it was "extremely symbolic" to be discovered exactly 100 years from his grandfather's work with metal.
According to London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van took his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very hostile and heavy shooting of artillery and cartels."
He later attacked the fireline and with “unbelievably bravely” carried the building forward before attacking the artillery army with one hand and killing three of the crew.
Colonel Van was killed by a German snowman on October 4, 1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions are "something I know I could never do, but it makes me calm."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, put a wedding after the council, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said it was "a great honor to participate in the parade" and added "the goodness of the real hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to see Bellator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine that all night you're waiting to see a full edition of Bellator 206 and finally you can't be witnesses to the main event.
San Jose's program contained 13 doubles, including six of the main cards, and was supposed to be released alive at night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., exactly when Gegard Mossi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the British observers remained shocked when the transfer changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after they had been built up by early hours, especially because of doubt.
Fen described on Twitter the turn of the child’s animation film as “some painful joke”.
"The government regulates that at 6 p.m. this content is not appropriate, so the programme has been changed by child transmission," said Dave Schwarz, senior marketing and communications vice president of Bellator, in response to the issue of abortion.
"Peppa poreste," yes."
The president of the company Bellator Scott Kokker said they would work on planning the meetings to include the British audiences in the future.
"I think that when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem," Koker said.
"There is, however, six mornings a week, and there is no way to plan things so that the event will take place on Sunday, and there will be Monday.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we got a lot of messages and not all were friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't that way, it was government.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We're going to stick to the inclusion of five two instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to give more to the fans, but we went too far.
This is an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt "lower" because of his sexuality
Olympian jumper in the water Tom Daily says he's grown up, feeling less than everyone else because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete claims that until he started high school, he didn't realize that "not all are like me."
In an interview on the first edition of the Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Lavern, he spoke of gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he started to be less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The permanent leader of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, is in hospitals for a few months.
In his first program of Lavern Daily, he said he felt "a little less" than all the others while he grew up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like girls and boys."
He said: “To this day the feeling of low self - worth and the fact that I am different from the others is, in fact, the things that give me energy and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove it was "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when he finally learned about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in LGBT's campaigns and used his participation in the British Community's current games in Australia to send a call to more countries to criminalize homosexuality.
He said he was doing this because he was happy that he could live openly, without consequences, and he wanted to inspire the “hope ” of others.
The three-time World Championship said that when he fell in love with a man – American director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, he was "extended."
Daily concluded a marriage with Oscar's carrier, who is 20 years older than him last year, but claims that the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you pass through so much while you're so young," he participates for the first time in the Olympic Games of 14 years, and his father died of cancer three years later, he said, "It's hard to find someone at your age who's had to live with such incomes and falls."
They both became parents in June and have a son, Robert Ray Black-Dley, and Dale says his "all-peace look" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I'd tell you that I'm just interested in winning a gold medal," he said.
"Do you know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was baptized to his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Dale told him that his father couldn't accept that he would die one of the last things he asked about was whether they already had tickets for the Olympic Games in London in 2012 – since he wanted to be first.
"I couldn't tell him "You won't be with me, Dad, nor at first," he said.
"I held his hand until I stopped breathing and at this point, when I realized he was dead, finally I realized that he was not vulnerable," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the Olympics in 2012 and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that I've been dreaming about it all my life – jumping the Olympic Games before the audience at home. There was no more fear," he said.
It also inspired the choice of his first song – “Proud” by Heder Smol – which was accompanied during his preparations for the Olympic Games and still makes him jump.
Desert Island Discs is released on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 p.m., British summer time.
The lost form of Michaelson remains on the "Rader Cup" scan on Saturday
American Phil Mikelson will put a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Radar Cup, but he will have to return his old form if he doesn't want his record to be linked to failure.
Michaelson, who participated in the two-year recording event for the 12th time, was left on the skimpy from Captain Jim Furic for "forball" and "forsom" games on Saturday.
Instead of being the main figure in the US team again, the fifth winner of large tournaments spent his day as a fan and training his attacks from distance with the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete who has never been among the most regular players in his career was not in an optimal form for Le Golf National’s hard game, where the long-term unequaled field usually condemns any wrong impact.
And if the game alone isn't worrying enough, in the ninth game on Monday, Mikelson will stand against the precise champion of the British Open French Molinarians, who is in a team with novelist Tommy Flytted and are trying to win all their four matches this week.
If the Americans who left four points before the 12th single match make a strong start, it may be that Michaelson's match is absolutely decisive.
Furic expressed confidence in his colleague, even though he could hardly say something much different.
"He fully understood his role today, he pushed me back, grabbed me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Furic said.
"He is confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Glory and has given as much as in the past and also this week.
I probably didn't imagine he was just playing in two games.
I was hoping he'd play more, but that's what he did, and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be at golf and play, just like everyone else."
Michaelson will improve Nick Faldo's record of most games in the "Rader Cup", played on Sunday.
This can put an end to his career in the Radar Cup, which has never been closer to his impressive individual achievements.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven matches, but Furic said his presence brings other benefits for a team that don't measure with numbers.
"He's funny, sarcastic, island, he likes to joke with people and he's a great man for every team," he explained.
"I think even younger players were having fun with him, especially this week.
He gives much more than that just to play."
Thomas Bourne, the captain of Europe, is aware that the great advantage can soon be achieved
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bourne, knows from personal experience that the great advantage, collected before the matches of a single match from the last day of the "Rader Cup", can be easily removed.
The date is due in the battle of Valderrama in 1997, when Captain Seve Balisteros' team took five points ahead of the Americans, but the final law was almost achieved and it was easy to maintain the victory with 141⁄2-131/2.
"You continue to remember that we had a great advantage for "Valderrama"; we had a great advantage and a Brookline where we lost, and Valderram we won, but very hard," said Bourne, after the 2018 European team won 5-3 sessions on Friday and yesterday, with 10-6 of "Le Golf National:.
So the story has to show me and everyone in the team that it's not over.
Get ready for the attack tomorrow.
Get out and do what you need.
Nothing's done until you see the final outcome of the table.
We have a goal, and it's to try to win this trophy, and that's exactly what we need to be focused on.
All the time, I repeated that I was thinking only of the 12 players in our team, but we are also aware of our opponents who are the biggest players in the world."
Comforted by the presentation of the players at a hard golf game, Bourne added: “I would never rush through the holidays.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow's ahead, the individual performances will come out and that's different.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but when you go out alone, you're gonna test your whole ability as a golf player.
This is the message that must reach players: tomorrow you must give your best.
Now you can turn your partner's back, as he has to go to the end."
Unlike Bourne, the opponent's captain Jim Furic will ask his players to present themselves better individually than partners, except Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who took three of the four possible points.
Furic himself was also from both sides of these great returns in the last day – he was part of the "Brockline" triumph, and then he was from the losing country when the Europeans performed the "Minah's Miracle".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to the question like Ben Krenshaw, the captain in 1999, led his players on the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but it would be good to do the same good start as you saw on Brooklyn, as well as on Medinah."
When the advantage passes from one direction to the other, these intermediate games are played under tremendous pressure.
That's why we formed our bodies and distributed our boys as we want to try to do the impossible tomorrow."
Tomas has the task of taking our counterattack and facing Rory Makillroy in the most important fight, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flyted and Jan Potter will meet with other Europeans in the upper half of the facility.
"I chose these players in this order because I think this gives us the greatest chance of success," Bourne said about his election for the Singles.
Germany renews the launch of a new warship
The latest brand of the German fleet was to be introduced into operation in 2014 to replace the old warships from the time of the Cold War, but this will not be achieved until the next year due to unjust systems and mainly rising costs reported by local media.
The entry into operation of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead vessel of the brand's new flag from the Baden-Wuertemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes an army speaker.
The shipping court had to join the military forces in 2014, but the problems arising after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Class Baden-Wuertemberg ships, ordered by the fleet in 2007, will replace the old class frigates Bremen.
We understand that they will have a powerful weapon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-shipment rockets, as well as some steel technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important characteristics include longer periods of maintenance – the latest brakes should be able to be used for up to two years before returning to the port of residence.
However, continuous entertainment means that the Hungarian military ships – for which it is said that they will allow Germany to demonstrate strength from the ocean – will already be old when they enter the operation, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 Corps entered the title last year when the German fleet officially refused to release the shipyard in operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipbuilding plant in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet returns the ship to the ship builder after delivery.
It is little known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of significant "software and hardware defects" that make the military ship useless if sent to a military mission.
The software deficiencies are particularly important, since the Baden-Wuertmberg class shipyards will be managed by a crew of about 120 seafarers – only half of the team of older frigates from Bremen class.
In addition, the ship has been significantly exceeded, which reduces its effectiveness and limits the possibility of military forces to add future attacks.
It is considered that the 7000-tonnes "Rheinland-Pfalz" are twice as heavy as ships from the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price of the whole project – including training of the team – is also becoming a problem.
It is believed that it reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion) – from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the latest brands are particularly important in the light of the fast warning that Germany's military forces are falling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Commission, admitted that the fleet was actually "dried from ships capable of carrying out missions".
The responsible person said that the problem had become bigger in time, as the old ships were driven by exploitation, but no new ones were provided.
He is complaining that not one class branch of Baden-Wuertemberg can be included in the fleet.
The National breast Follows the Secret Life of the Bees
A new study carried out in possession of the Scottish mountains aims to determine how birds use landscapes when hunting.
It is hoped that the discovery will shed new light on the behavior of unique flight crews and will help in managing future maintenance operations.
The study of students from Scotland’s National breast will often follow the catches, as well as the coffees of the Inverwe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations in the property to monitor the actions of the docks during the season.
NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using hand detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of the calls of the tapes, as well as the types that they issue.
They will then be prepared a map of the location and report to create a detailed landscape map of their behavior.
Rob Duar, a natural conservation consultant for NTSC, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of location are most important for attractiveness and how they are used in all kinds.
This information will help determine the benefits of the site management work, e.g. the creation of libads, as well as the best way to maintain the forest areas for carpets and other related species.
The populations of bees in Scotland and the United Kingdom as a whole have significantly decreased over the past century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their shelters and lead to the loss of habitats.
The risk to populations may be caused by wind turbines and lighting, flying equipment and some chemical processing of building materials as well as attacks by domestic catacombs.
In fact, the bees are not blind.
However, because of their hunting habits during the night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation techniques to catch the bugs and obstacles to their flight trajectory.
NTSC, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 buildings of great importance and 76 000 hectares of land in the country, takes the most serious approach.
The breast has trained experts who conduct regular studies, asylum inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even created the first reserve in Scotland and the only special reserve for trailers in the Dumfries and Galway property, which is home to eight of the 10 species in Scotland.
The owner of David Thompson's property says it's an ideal territory for them.
"But, in Threave, we have a great garden for the beads," he noted.
"We have old buildings, very old trees and complete suitable accommodation.
But there's a lot more about attractive things that are not known, so the work that we do here and in other property will help us understand better than they need to reproduce."
He stressed that it was important to check the presence of bees before carrying out property-supported activities, since it is possible to destroy a shelter to kill up to 400 women and young bees, as well as to destroy the entire local population.
The bees are a protected species and it is illegal to kill themselves, tortmosis, to disturb or destroy their refugees.
Elizabeth Ferl, a Scottish servant in the Trinity to protect the bees, encouraged the society to help.
She said: “I still have much to learn about our beautiful and many animal species, because we just don't know what's going on with their populations."
Ronaldo rejects the allegations of rape and his lawyers will judge a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo identified the allegations of rape against him as a "false news," saying that people "want to become famous", using his name.
His lawyers will judge the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which publishes these claims.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of rape by American Catherine Mayorga at a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He claims he paid her $375,000 to shut down the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a video in Instagram, turning to its 142 million followers, a few hours after the 33-year-old Ronaldo published the publication as a "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is false news," said the camera's fifth gold ball player.
"They want to become famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to collect popularity on my back, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the footballist smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are ready to judge Der Spiegel for the claims that they call "unacceptable publication of suspicions in the field of personal life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Shertz said the footballist would seek compensation for "moral fees in proportion to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
It is claimed that the incident took place in June 2009 in an apartment in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at night's club, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the football club room, where they claimed he raped her similarly, according to the documents submitted to the District Court of Clark in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees and told her he was a "good boy" of 99 percent, but in the case he just gave up on "one percent".
According to Ronaldo's documents, he confirmed that they were normal sex, but that's what happened with her consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken photos of her injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to an extravagance agreement because she felt "dangerous from punishment" and worried not to be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the agreement, as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident.
During the incident, Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid from Manchester, United States, and this summer was transferred to the Italian Grant Juventus for the sum of 100m euros.
Breszit: Britain "I'm sorry forever" that it lost its car manufacturers
Britain "yet regrets forever" if it loses its status as world leader in the production of cars after Breszite, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it's "responsive", that from Toyota UK they told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily stop its production in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," he said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of cutting off the border in the case of Breszite without trading could lead to loss of jobs.
In Bernaston – where Auris and Avensis models are produced – nearly 150 000 cars have been produced last year, 90% of which have been exported to the other countries of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if the UK comes out of the EU by the end of March, the production in our business will stop," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade would operate.
BMW, for example, say they're going to close their business for the Mini model in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main threats of car manufacturers are related to the risks of the risk of delivery in cases of Brekzit without trading.
Toyota’s production line is working on the "right time" principle, as the parts arrive at every 37 minutes from suppliers, both from Britain and the EU for cars developed by order.
If the UK leaves the EU without trading on 29 March, there may be problems at the border, which, according to the industry, may lead to some entertainment and lack of part.
For Toyota it would be impossible to wait more than one day to complete their venture in Darbisher, they said from the company, and therefore the production would stop.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa May's "schahematic plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks."
"We must have a deal. We want to conclude the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to be able to capture this opportunity," he said in BBC Radio's program 4's Today.
"After the claims not only to Toyota, but also to other producers, we are absolutely convinced that we should be able to continue to provide successful supply chains."
Toyota cannot say how long it will be to stop production, but in a longer-term plan they warn that additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the industry and ultimately lead to loss of jobs.
Peter Cavalaris, who has been a founder of the Union for 24 years, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “I feel that if these jobs go away, they will never come back.
The government speaker said: "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The meeting between Tromp and Rosenstein can be postponed again, says the White House
The extremely important meeting between Donald Tromp with Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein can be "deployed for another week", as he continues his campaign for the Supreme Court of Bret Kavano, reports the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian entry into the elections, relations between Tromp and Russia's assistants and the potential obstacle to justice by the president.
This is whether Trump will fire the deputy chief prosecutor, or not so will threaten Mueller's independence, for months he's been feeding his ears for Washington.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosentian denied this claim.
But last Monday he went to the White House after reports of leaving.
Instead, while Trump was in the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting with him was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "pretend not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the hearing before the Senate's legal commission, for which both Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment – Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation by the FBI of the complaints against Cavano, even more fun with the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's speaker, Sarah Sanders, appeared Sunday at Fox News.
When she was asked a question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “There is not yet a date for this, it may be this week, but by seeing all the other things that happen in the Supreme Court, I think it can be postponed for the next week.
But we'll see, and I always try to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would argue this claim: Sanders did not hold a press conference from the White House on 10 September.
The transmission leader Chris Wallace asked for the reason.
Sanders said that regular press conferences were not due to the "democracy behaviour" of television journalists, although he said, "I can't say I don't agree with the fact that they have a demonstration."
Then she pointed out that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president is conducting more sessions on questions and answers from each president before him," she said, adding, without citing the evidence: "We checked these statistics."
There will still be press conferences, continued Sanders, but "if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, this is far better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this often and you are witnesses to practice it quite often in the last few weeks, and this will replace the press conferences, after you have the opportunity to speak to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or preconventions with guests.
Possible preconventions are rare.
This week in New York, the president may show why, with his excentrative and strange behavior before the journalists gathered.
The Health Minister turned to EU staff in Scotland's National Health Service for Fears related to Brexit
The Health Minister turned to EU staff working in Scotland's National Health Service to express appreciation for the country and their desire to stay in their place after Brexit.
Jean Freyman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter to the remaining less than six months until Britain was released from the EU.
The Swedish government has already committed to the costs of the established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms. Fryman wrote: “In the summer negotiations between Britain and the EU on leaving continued, with decisions to be expected in this regard.
But the UK government is also making progress in its preparations for a possible scenario without transaction.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to remind you of the great value of the contribution of each servant, regardless of his nationality.
Fellows from across the EU and from it contribute valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which is of benefit to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we would like you to stay here."
Cristian Abercrombie suffers from a sudden operation after getting trauma on his head
Tenesi State Tigers, Krischen Abrkrombi, suffered a sudden operation after he got a headache during the meeting on Saturday, when his team lost Vanderbilt Comodores from 31-27, reported Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Senior trainer at Tennessee State, Rod Reed, shared with reporters that the trauma took place shortly before the mid-term.
"He went to the side line and somehow belonged there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel provided Abercrombie's oxygen on the side line before it was placed on the nose and brought into the eyelids for further examination.
A servant of Tennessee State confirmed before Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was released from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no details about the nature/seriousness of the trauma", as well as that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the trauma occurred.
Abrkromby, a college graduate, is for the first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday he made a total of five blocks before leaving the game, which makes 18 blocks for him during this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher mortgages when buying real estate in Great Britain
According to new conservative plans, foreign buyers will be paid a higher mortgage on buying real estate in Britain, with additional funds to help homeless people.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the Serbian tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The state house expects an increase of over 120 million British pounds per year, which will help homeless people
Teresa May will today announce the decision of foreign buyers to pay a higher mortgage on buying real estate in Britain, as additional income will go to help homeless people.
At this stage it will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young voters, promising more accessible housing and is directed towards people with high incomes.
The increase in the Serbian tax will affect individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain, and with additional revenues will help the government's efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The addition – which is an addition to the current Serbian tax, including higher levels introduced two years ago for second housing and property purchased for the purpose of granting – may amount to up to three per cent.
The state house expects the progress to be increased by up to 120 million British pounds per year.
About 13 per cent of the newly built buildings in London are purchased from citizens outside Britain, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for those who buy their first-time property to enter the property market.
Many of the rich areas – especially in the capital – have become “extraordinary cities” because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy appears only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the labor force to help more young people to own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices of property, stealing the land, but not using it, and asked Mrs. May to leave the quotas for accessible housing to fix the UK's "residence with housing".
Mr. Corbin announced an attractive series of housing reform proposals, including control over loans and the end of the "no wine".
He also wants to give the councils greater powers to build new houses.
Ms. May said: “For the past year, I shared that I would like to dedicate my time as prime minister to restoring the British dream – the life of every new generation to be better.
And that means we're gonna fix our housing market.
Great Britain will always be open doors for those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it's not fair people who don't live in Britain, as well as foreign companies, to buy as easy housing as hard workers in Britain.
For too many people the dream of owning their own home has gone too far in time, and the escape from sleep on the street remains too realistic."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to run a team in Scotland"
Sandrland manager Jack Ross said "the biggest ambition" in his career is to be the top trainer in Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish accepted the challenge of creating a club from northeastern England, which is currently located in the third position in the First League, at three points from the first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light this summer after the last season brought St. Miron back to the Scotland High League.
"I wanted to play for my family as a player.
I wrote a fight for the B team and that was all," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sports Sound.
"But I grew up with the game of Hempden, which we as a child looked at with my father, so the national team always attracted me.
"This opportunity, however, would only open if I had success at the club level."
Among the presidents of Ross as managers of the Sandrland are Dick Lawyers, David Mois, Sam Alderdas, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
Aloa Atletik's former teacher said he did not experience anxiety as a heir of such established names in a similar significant club, which he had previously rejected tenders from Barnes and Ipsuich Town.
"For me the success will now be measured with a positive answer to the question "Can I return this club to the High League?"
Because by structure, base and conditions it is undoubtedly at the level of the High League," he said.
"It won't be easy to get back to the highest level of football, but I'll accept that I've achieved success here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross is only a manager for three years, after spending some time as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months at Harts' training level.
Then he helped Aloa not to fall into the Third Division and turned St. Miron from a dropout team to a winner in Campionship in the following season.
Ross shares that he now feels more comfortable than during his football career in Clyde, Hartlipul, Volker, St. Miron and Hamilton Academy.
"I was really on the cross," he reminded me of the time when he ate Aloa.
"I really believed that being a manager is the best way for me, including before I was an active player.
It sounds strange because I did well, I made good money, and I had some significant success.
But sometimes it's hard to be a player.
There's a lot of things you need to deal with every week.
I'm still faced with the same levels of stress and stress at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now, when I'm really doing it, I've never felt more comfortable in my skin all my conscious life."

The ideal time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, discovers research
The summer heat increased the incomes of the combatants to survive British pubs, but increased stress for the faithful restaurants.
The pop and bar groups reported an increase in sales of 2.7 per cent in July, but the income in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, statistics show.
Peter Martin of the Business Consultant CGA, who compiled statistics, said: "For a long time and longer since England's expected participation in the World Cup, a similar model was followed in July when the fathers reported an increase of 2.8 per cent, but the restaurants received a stronger impact.
The loss of 1.8 per cent in the restaurant business in June is only deepening in July.
The beans and drinks bars reported the best results in their growth compared to the low movement of restaurants.
Food pumps also suffered from the sun's time, but not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink something.
In the pubs and bars the sale of drinks jumped by 6.6 per cent per month, while food was reduced by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, of RSM’s breath and entertainment analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we observed at the end of April.
Time and influence of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the services sector outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to suffer, although sales fall by 4.8 per cent of the annual basis may be particularly painful in addition to constant costs.
The long summer summer could not have been worse for the food companies' managers and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have examined in August will bring such a desired rest."
The overall increase in the sales of apples and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the entertainment in breaking up the brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, an analysis of sales in the cotton, bar and restaurants sector in Britain, collects and analyzes data on the implementation of 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of over 9 billion British pounds, and is a confirmed figure in the area.
One of five children hiding from their parents' secret profile on the social network.
One out of five children – some easily 11 – has a secret profile in a social network that hides from their parents and teachers, discovers research.
A study conducted among 20,000 high school students shows the growth of fake Insta pages
News has raised fears that material is published with sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they have a "principal" profile that shows their parents.
One out of five children – some of 11 – creates a profile in a social network that keeps it secret from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students shows growth in the fake Instagram accounts – a link to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news raised the fears that material was published with sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a clean "main" profile that shows their parents, and at the same time have secret profiles.
A mother who appeared on her 13-year-old daughter's secret site discovered a teenager who encouraged others to "strengthen him".
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC of independent schools revealed that 40 per cent of children between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, with half of them acknowledging that they keep their profiles secret.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: “It is sad that so many teenagers have been tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elyde Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" in Borda of the Light Atlantic in Scotland.
Elyde Doyle was elected to join the board of medical athletes in Scotland as director of the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful helicopter, and President Yon Byty has determined this course as a wonderful opportunity for these, leading in the sport, to benefit from her rich international experience over the last decade.
"Eilide is delighted with great respect for the Scottish, British and World Lectopatric Communities, and we are convinced that the cure in Scotland will benefit greatly from its appeal," Byti said.
Doyle said: "I want to be the voice of the athletes and I really hope I can contribute and help to promote sports in Scotland."
The American who won the finals of 200 and 400 metres of the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, adding to its four Olympic gold medals together, and is currently a regular commenter in BBC, lost the ability to walk after getting a transitional chemical approach.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I was hit.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time will show me how much I'm going to get back.
It was an exhilarating job, but I got a full recovery, I learned to walk again, and today I'm doing mobility training!
Thank you for the positive news."
Advertisement for a cream pump that compares cows' mothers to cows, share online views
The company producing cream pumps has shared online views with advertising that compares pregnant mothers with cows that come in.
In order to mark the release of the market of the expected "first wireless pump for cream in the world suitable for wear", Elvie’s consumer technology company released the shopping music-video advertising in order to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump provides to the Germans to show themselves.
Four real mothers dance in a kroosc, full of snow, on the background of a song with a text, including: "Yes, I come, but you don't see any struggle" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not wet, these are my ears."
The song continues: “Shut up, pump out, feed the babies with them, pump them, pump them out, bring their friends.”
However, the advertising, published on the company's Facebook page, causes online differences.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the clip received mixed reactions from viewers, as many say it reduces the "greasing" of the dairy industry.
"It is a very stupid decision to use cows for advertising on this product.
Like us, they should be pregnant and born to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after birth," someone wrote.

Another comment: “We fully understand that it is traumatic both for the mother and for the baby.
But, yes, why don't we use them for a mother-fucking pump that can keep their babies?"
Another added: "So inadequate advertising."
Others protected the advertising as a woman admitted that she considered the song "extremely fun".
"I think the idea is genius.
I'd buy it if I was still hungry.
The shock made me feel like a cow.
The advertising is a little expensive, but I accept it the way it is.
This product is genius," someone wrote.
Another comment: “This is a funny advertising directed at mothers who sit down (often at their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like “crowds. ”
This is not a advertising that promotes or condemns milk processing industry."
At the end of the clip, the women discovered that they were dancing with the discreet pumps placed in their purses.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many women who are pregnant feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely unspoiled, has no holes or holes and is gathered discreetly in the sense of cremation, which gives women the freedom to move, to keep their babies and even to get out while they get out.
Anna Balarin, partner and Executive Director at Mother, comments: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a courageous and provocative release on the market.
By drawing a parallel between the cream and milked cows, we wanted to focus on the melting of cream and all the challenges associated with it, at the same time showing at the same time the incredible feeling of freedom that will bring the new pump.
This isn't the first time Elvie pump fell in the leading news.
During the week of fashion in London, a mother of two children appeared on the floor for designer Martha Yakubovski using the product.
Hundreds of children of migrants have been sent secretly to the palace camp at the border with Texas
The number of children detained by migrants jumped sharply, although the monthly crossings of the border remained relatively unchanged, especially because the strict rhetoric and policy of the Tromp administration made it difficult for children to be raised with hostages.
Usually most citizens are immigrants without documents who fear that they will risk their stay in the country if they want to recognise children.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential beneficiaries and other elderly members of the family should provide fingerprints, such as the data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, high-ranking official in the Immigration and Military Service, testified before the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wanted to become hostages to unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no previous criminal records.
"About 80 per cent of the persons who are either tenants or members of the family of tenants live illegally in the country as most of them are foreign criminals.
So we'll continue to track these people," said Albens.
In order to deal more quickly with the registration of these children, the authorities imposed new rules that some of them require to appear before the court within a month of their detention, not after 60 days, as the previous rule was, according to officials in the favor.
Many appear in a video conference, not personally, to present their case for a legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are defined as inappropriate for authorisation will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer the children remain kept, the more likely they are to become depressed or depressed, which may lead to violent escapes or trials, according to reception officials and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers explained that this concern is growing in large facilities, such as in Tornilo, where the evidence that some children have problems is more likely to be ignored because of the size of the place.
They added that the movement of children in “the Palatine City” does not give them enough time to prepare for emotional or to get along with their friends, can ease the trauma that many already struggle with.
Syria urges the US, France and Turkey's "occupational forces" to be immediately released
Turning to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mulem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although civil war has continued for eight years.
Mualem, who also assumes the post of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign troops are illegally living in a Syrian country in the context of combating terrorism and "they will be taken into account".
"They must be downloaded immediately and without any conditions," he said to the congregation.
Mualem insisted that "war against terror is near its end" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been violently displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "to fight in this sacred battle until all Syrian countries are cleansed" both by terrorist organizations and by "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2000 military officers in Syria, who primarily train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian parties, against President Basar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 military personnel in the countries that have been left behind by the war.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said that the conditions are harsh and can turn back, accusing “some Western states that they are ‘inspired with unbridled fears,’ which motivate refugees to stand out.
"We have urged the international community and humanitarian organizations to cooperate on these returns," he said.
"They turn into a political issue which is a completely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be provided for the restoration of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to cease the war is reached.
UN diplomats stated that the rapid agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major strength of the rebels in Idlib provides an opportunity for progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces over the province where three million people live.
However, we stress that the agreement has "explain times" and expressed the hope that military actions will be directed towards the Jihadists, including combatants from Al-Qaida's front "Al Nusra", which "will still be destroyed".
UN envoy Stefan de Mistura is hoping to get the first meetings of the new committee, consisting of members of the government and opposition, to form a draft of Syria's next constitution and to proceed to elections.
Mualam presented the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee, stating that the work of the panel should be limited to "visiting the members of the present Constitution" and warned that there should be no involvement.
Why Tromp will win a second mandate?
According to this logic, Trump will win a re-election of the elections in 2020, unless, as many Liberians are likely to hope, his presidency will not be terminated in time due to impiechment and scandal.
This would undoubtedly be the most dramatic end of the presidency ever!
There's no sign of the death of the viewers right now.
From 2014 onwards, the prevalence of priytium increased by twice to 1.05 million at CNN and almost three times to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during primetime, compared to 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" of MSNBC is at the top of a cable TV rating, with up to 3.5 million viewers at evenings with big news.
"This is a fire that draws people because it's something we don't understand," says Neil Baer, an executive producer of the ABC drama "Last candidate", where he talks to the cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack against Capitolia.
Nell Scoll, who is a veteran-scanist of comedy and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club", has another theory.
She remembered driving in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, "Why?"
Mrs. Scowl told me that he answered her, "Because she's smiling at me."
There's a party in chaos.
Of course, unlike everything that is shown on television, Washington's history can determine the future of "Roo v. Wade", whether immigrant families can be reunited again, as well as the good state of the world economy.
Exclude is a luxury that can only allow the most privileged viewers.
However, the desire to inform a citizen does not correspond to this in six hours to see a group of experts discussing Bob Udurd, who uses "deep historical information" as a source for his book "Treaty"; Paul Manafort's pilot's coat of arse skin for $15,000 (“done filled with arogenity” according to Washington Post), and the disturbing descriptions of Stromi Daniels about Mr. Tromp's anatomy.
Especially will I never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"The part of what he does to make you feel like part of the real show is to give you at least every night," said Brent Montgomery, the chief executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator of Pawn Stars, regarding the changing participants and daily elections (interference with the National Football League, hosting Kim Chen Un).

When I got in touch with Mr. Fles this week, he was on the north coast of Kaway was sunrise, 80 degrees, but he was shut down at home to see MSNBC, at the same time recording CNN.
It could not be separated from television, especially when Bret Kavano had to stand before the Senate's legal commission, and this depended on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we once made all those strong translations and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fless shared in front of me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Investments are affected by the most delayed overhaul in early elections for a place in Congress
It is not surprising that the 17th round of Pennsylvania receives a flow of money, thanks to the reorganization of the Congress's rounds and from there two titles for the same place.
The split circle in Pittsburgh's premier points to Connor Lamb's conservative democracy, which won its place from another round of partial elections last summer.
Lamb stands against another writer, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently represented by the old 12th round of Pennsylvania, which is significantly affected by the new 17th.
The cards were re-designed after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania announced in January that the old circles were anti-constitutionally manipulated for the benefit of the republics.
The debate in the new 17th round has created a financial dispute between the main funding institutions of the parties, the DCCC and the NRCC.
Lamb goes to Pennsylvania after the difficult victory in the widely discussed partial elections in March for the 18th convention round of Pennsylvania.
The position was taken by the Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won a round of 20 points.
Political experts believe that democracy has an easy advantage.
The United States considered the imposition of sanctions on El Salvador for his support for China, after which he withdrew
The diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Tromp had a hearty meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017, and he also owned a hotel in Panama until partners fired the management team from the Trump Organization.
The representatives of the State Department decided to address the leaders of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, because of "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore", said earlier this month, Heather Naurt, speaker of the Department.
But sanctions were imposed only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received approximately 140 million US dollars' assistance in combating drugs, with a view to development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, including the imposition of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be punishable by the state of Central America with its unemployment and the percentage of murders.
In advance of the internal meetings, officials from North and Central America held a high-level conference aimed at security and economic well-being, which served to continue such a gathering last year, viewed as a step forward in the efforts to prevent the flow of migrants to the United States.
But in mid-September, the high-level executives pointed out that their desire to attend the conference was so effective that they stopped any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Now Vice-President Mike Pens said he will participate in the conference planned for the mid-October, as a sign of the importance that the administration gives to the assembly, diplomats say.
The three American envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
The spokesman for the White House for Mr Bolton rejected a comment on the details of the discussion described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, wanted to remain anonymous who agreed to participate in the internal discussions.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyser, close to the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History of the Study
The next step may be the report of Special Adviser Robert Muller on the possible obstacle to the justice of Mr Tromp, as the report is currently a significant evidence in the public register.
It is claimed that Mr. Muller is directing his investigation and that Mr. Tromp has spoken with Russia during his campaign against our elections.
If the leadership of the Congress changes, it will be shown that Mr. Tromp will have to be considered before this body, just when he is ready to speak before the voters, as well as perhaps before the judges of his colleagues.
There is a lot of strangers here and I do not insist that Mr. Tromp's fall is inevitable – neither is this the case with those of him in Europe.
All of us, from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, have to make these choices that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to perform a coup against Hitler, and the West was charged with supporting the Czechs in Munich.
We broke down and missed the opportunity to avoid the years that followed.
The course of history depends on such occasions, and the unimposed march of democracy speeds up or fun.
At the moment, Americans have been set up before a few such incidents.
What would we do if Mr. Tromp fired Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds in his hands the fate of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenta's comments have been made since this journalist reported that last year he had proposed to write a secret note to the president and expressed his opinion that it was not appropriate for the post.
Mr Rosenstein said the history of Times was incorrect.
"How will we react if the new investigation against Brett Kavano, required by the FBI, is not complete or fair – or if it is approved for the Supreme Court in spite of sexual harassment and lying?
And most importantly, will we vote in the morning elections for Congress if this will force Mr. Tromp to take responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy waits for a long winter.
But I believe we won't fail because I took a lesson from Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz from the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my missionary home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to burn the saints for Shabat on that table with a swastika.
With inheritances like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorans from Rangers is an optimist for the crash with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers are the domains of Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians after the impressive equality in Spain against Villaral earlier this month will give them a significant chance to move forward from the G Group of the League of Europe.
Contusion in the coronation did not allow Lieutenant Graham Dorans to play his first game for the season before the issue equality 2-2 with Villaral, but he believes that for Rangers this result can turn into a triumphal triumph for larger achievements.
"We have won an important point because Villaral is a good opponent," said 31-year-old footballist.
"We went into the game with hope that we could win something and we left the point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the game, but the whole equation seems fair.
They were better in the first half, and we were the second.
We've taken a look at Thursday, another big night from our games in Europe.
I hope we can fight for three points, this will be a hard fight because they have achieved a good outcome in the past meeting, but I'm sure with the support of our public we can give everything ourselves and achieve a good outcome.
The last year was definitely hard after everything that happened around my circumstances and changes in the club, but now things seem to have gone in the direction.
The team is good and the boys are really having fun, the exercises are useful.
I hope that we will be able to exert ourselves to forget the past season and achieve the desired achievements."
Women are worried about fear of their pensions
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear picture of what concerns they would like to receive, few people discuss this with family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationalwide study said they had discussed with their wives the long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent talked to their children about this.
"Hours want family members to take care of them, but they have not taken steps to conduct this conversation," said Holly Snaider, vice-president of the National Biospatial Activities Sector.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your wife and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t declare your wishes beforehand.
Together with your consultant and your family, discuss where and how you want to be concerned, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining costs.
Include your financial adviser: Your advisor can also help you with the idea of how to pay these costs.
Your decisions when you choose a financial institution for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with a cash value to help cover these costs or insurance with your means – if you have the money resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with legal battles in the beginning.
Appoint a health care provider, so that you have a certain creditor who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes, if you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, the idea of a financier on financial matters.
You can choose a trusted person who will take the financial decisions from your name and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your aging parent needs urgent medical care and is traveling to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergic reactions?
Show these details in writing so you can be prepared.
"It's not just about the financial aspect, but about what doctors will be," Martin asked.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Set up your plan."
A man was shot several times with an air gun in Ilfracomb.
A man was shot several times with an air gun while he was home at night out.
The victim, about 40 years old, was located in Oxford Grove, Ilfracomb, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
The police describe the shooting that took place about 02:30 p.m. in the British summer, as a "consequent act".
The victim couldn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are trying to attract witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities announced that the number of dead was expected to grow.
Due to the delayed communications, support organisations cannot obtain information from Dongala Regent, a region north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of earthquakes with magnitude of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated to Palo after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala that are located on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulavesi, located at the end of a quiet beach overlooking the west coast of the island of Sulavesi, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Dongala is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) across the coast of the island of Sulavesi.
The Administrative Region, which is less than a province, is a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis for the economy of the province's central Sulawesi province, particularly in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel's gains are also of importance to the province, but is concentrated mainly in Moroval, on the opposite side of Sulavesi.
Palo and Dongala have been excavated several times by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to data from the Indonesian disaster recovery agency.
In 1938, tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
The tsunami hit the western part of Dongala and in 1996 when nine people were killed.
Indonesia is located on the seismic "Theookaan fire ring" and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and wave tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong storm of 26 December on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra activates wave tsunamis, which hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Naas, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Cross with magnitude 6.8 percussion of the largest population of the island in Indonesia, Java, activates tsunamis that split the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude earthquake 7.5 hits one of the Isle of Mantawa and activates 10-metre wave tsunamis that destroyed ten villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A sudden earthquake struck the Pidi Jaya Regency in Aceh as a result of destruction and panic, as people remembered the losses of deadly earthquakes and tsunamis in 2004.
This time, tsunamis don't activate, but more than 100 people were killed by crowded buildings.
2018: Strong storms swept the tourist island of Lombok into Indonesia, killed more than 500 people, most of them from the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily homeless.
Sara Pailin's eldest son is arrested for charges of domestic violence
Trak Peelin, the son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sara Peelin, was arrested for charges of violence.
Pailin, aged 29, from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicions of domestic violence, involvement in domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report of the state police in Alaska, published on Saturday.
According to a police report, when she was known by the police to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she took the phone.
Pailin is kept in the pre-containment building Mat-Su and under an unsecured guarantee of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself “unsuspectively, ” when he was asked to plead, reports the media.
Pailin is threatened by a three-fold punishment of Class A, which means that it can be deprived of liberty for a year and pay a global amount of $250,000.
He is also accused of a simple class B, which is punished one day in jail and a $2,000.
This isn't the first time the charges against Pailin are filed.
In December 2017 he was accused of an attack on his father, Todd Pailin.
His mother, Sara Pailin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently under consideration by the Court of the Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, involvement in the reporting of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of contaminants in connection with the incident.
His friend claims he hit her with a fist in his face.
Sarah Pailin was criticized by a group of veterans in 2016 when he associated his son's aggressive behavior with post-traumatic stress arising from his service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds died
At least 384 people were killed by earthquakes that swept the Indonesian island of Slavage on Friday.
The quake with magnitude 7.5 caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication network is interrupted, expecting the number of the dead to grow in the near days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeastern of the capital of Indonesia – Jakarta.
In the social networks, the clips show the moment of collapse.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in Palu when the wave of tsunamis flew over the coast.
Federal prosecutors want a series of death sentences for suspects in a terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors from New York want a death penalty for Saifulo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York where eight people were killed – rarely met by a penalty that was not executed in the federal criminal state since 1953.
It is claimed that Saipov, a 30-year-old, used a truck hired by Home Depot to run the attack in October on the bike near the West Side Master's Valley in the Manhattan Valley, gas stations and passengers on his way.
In order to justify the death sentence, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov has killed eight victims "inspired" and "inspired" has caused serious physical damage, according to the memorial notice regarding the death penalty application in South York.
According to the court document and the two charges may be brought to an end by a death sentence.
Seven weeks after the attack, an enlarged federal court body sent Saipov a 22-point indictment, including eight murder charges, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as a prosecution of violence and destruction of the IPS.
The attack required "serious planning and intentional", the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov was executed as "serious, cruel and disgusting".
"Syifulo Habibulajevic Saipov caused trauma, injury and loss of families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Lori Dekad, Darn Drake, Ariel Erley, Ernan Felluchi and Alejandro Damyan Panuko," the report says.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since New York's last South region was looking for death penalty.
The accused, Halid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was subsequently sentenced to a life sentence in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was executed in New York, it was in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a family couple who were executed after a trial for conspiracy and execution of the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed at the power plant on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show a feeling of disappointment during the days and months after the attack, according to the judicial documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about the side, says the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to do the attack, after watching the clips of the IDIL on his phone, the prosecutor said.
He also asked in his hospital room to set up the IDIL signal, shared by the police.
He was indicted by the prosecution act, consisting of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that "they are obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death sentence instead of a death sentence for a criminal and life imprisonment without the possibility of early release will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events on all concerned," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutor not to ask for a death sentence.
Member of Parliament of the Conservatives says NAYJEL FARAZ should lead the negotiations for Brexit
Nigel Faraj has been called to "mobileize the army of the people" today during a protest at the Conservative Conference.
The former leader of the British Party of Independence said politicians should "take pressure" – as one of Teresa May's own party's members proposed that he conduct negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bonn, a member of the Conservatives, said in March in Birmingham that the UK "had yet gone", if Mr. Faraj was a secretary of the British affairs.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to agree with the deeply divided order of the party was stressed by conservatives supporting the stay that joined to a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to preserve its compromise plan "Checkers", despite attacks by the supporters of the Brigade, the supporters of the remaining EU.
The Unions insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite the hostile reactions and urge the Eurosceptics and librarians to choose between its package and the chaos.
Mr. Bonn said before the protesters with the logo "Exit means going out" in Solihol that he wanted to "break up the Chequers".
He said that Mr. Faraj should have participated equally with the others and that he should have been responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were the beginning, we would've left so far," he said.
The Member of Wenningbrow added: "I support Brexit, but we must close the "Checkers" plan.
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in the world wars to become slaves.
We want to create our laws in our own country."
Mr. Bonn rejected the claim that the public opinion had changed from the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their opinion and they want to stay is completely false."
Conservative representative Andrea Jenkins also participates in the rally, sharing before the reporters: “I just say, Mr. Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Checkers" is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for him, he is not popular in our party and our activists who actually went out on the street and actually helped us to be elected.
Please cut "Checkers" and start listening."
In an open letter to Mrs. May, she added: “Premiers keep their position when they keep their promises.”
Mr Faraj said at the outset that politicians should "get pressure" if they consider changing the decision taken after the referendum in 2016.
"Now it's about trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to change Brexit and we're gathered here today to say "We won't let you go."
Turning to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to change Brazil, feel pressure.
"We mobilize the army of the people of this country, which has helped us to win at Brexit, and we will never stop until we become independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, the supportive stay passed through Birmingham before two hours of migrating in the city center.
Top activists have raised flags with "Conservatives against Breczit", after the group's launch this weekend.
The librarian Lord Adonis is playing with the conservators on the safety of the party's application when it comes to the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology of Canada and still, for the safe crossing of borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a whole fascist.
There's no such thing as good Bresit," he added.
Warren said he'd "think seriously" his candidate for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would "think seriously about the possibility of candidates for president" after the elections in November.
Boston Globe reported that the representative of the democracys of Massachusetts spoke about his future during the city council in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a constant critic of President Donald Trump, will be candidates for a re-election in November against the Republicans' representative Jeff Dale, who was co-chaired by the Tromp campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
She's in the center of speculation that she can take the post of Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Hollywood was her 36th meeting with electors in the mayor's building after Tromp's entry into office.
One of the guests asked her if she was planning to apply for president.
Warren said it was finally time for "the women to go to Washington and repair our damaged government, including women on top."
He's been arrested for the death of Sims by LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that there was a suspect in the shooting on Friday, when basketballist Wade Sims was killed by the LSU.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of Dayton Simpson, a 20-year-old, during a press conference at 11:00 a.m. east time.
They published a video from the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying a man who was seen on the frames.
Sims, a 20-year-old, was shot and killed near the South University area early Friday morning.
"Weid Sims is shot in the head, which ultimately leads to his death," reported police chief Murphy J. Paul before the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade's set up to protect his friend and he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted he was at the crime scene, had a gun, and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without trial and held in custody of the community's East Baton Rouge police department.
A youth with a rise of 6′6′′ grew up in Baton Rouge – Sims participated in 32 matches with 10 exits as a titler last season and recorded an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 matches.
Gran At Russia: Luis Hamilton is even closer to the world title after his team's instructions helped him win Sebastian Fetel
More from the moment Walter Botas is ranked ahead of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the instructions of the Mercedes team will play an important role in the competition.
Botas made a good start from the first position and seriously worried Hamilton while protecting his position in the first two races, which enabled Fetel to attack his cousin.
Fetel first made a pit stop and let Hamilton deal with the traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be a decisive way to get out of the competition.
The mercedes also made a pist-stop of the next round and went out after Fetel, but Hamilton managed to break him after a stroke and drive a "gum to rubber", which forced Ferrari's pilot to release the inner part of the track to avoid punishment for extra time after he had already closed his opponent's path with a dangerous double-protective manoeuvre on the third floor.
I set up my 21st birthday, Max Versapen, started from the back rows of the start row and was seven after the end of the first round.
After that, he even led over a long period of competition, since he had decided to change his tires later than the others, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the contest and possibly defeat Kimi Reaconen in the battle for the fourth position.
Finally, he entered the Pit-stop in the 44th round, but he couldn't pay enough in the next eight rounds, and in the final account, Raykonen completed four.
It was a hard day, since Walter was doing a great job all week, and he showed up as a real gentleman when he let me defend him.
The team has done an extraordinary job to win the first two positions on the floor," Hamilton said.
This was really a bad language of the body.
President Donald Tromp has argued with Senator Diana Fynstein on the rally on Saturday because of her claim that she has not circulated the letter from Christine Blaise Ford, who accuses the president of Supreme Court Bret Kavano in a sexual visit.
During a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the demonstrations given by the Forum before the Senate's Legal Commission, but rather commented on how what happened in the Senate shows that people are "bad and disgusting and undisclosed".
"What can happen also the good that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry people and wicked people, and disgusting and dishonest people," he said.
"When you look at publications and distribution, they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Fynstein, are you spreading?
Do you remember her answer... did you leave the document - "Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't spread."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we spread... no, we didn't spread," he added, imitating the senator.
Fignenstein sent the letter with details of the allegations against Cavano still in July, and it was distributed earlier in September – but Fignenstein denied that the distribution had happened by her office.
"I didn't cover Ford's claims, I didn't spread her story," Feinstein told the Commission, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep my trust, and I kept my trust as she wanted."
But the rejection of her was not well received by the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday evening: “I will tell you that this was a very bad language of the body.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst language I've ever seen."
Continuing to protect the High Court prosecutor charged with sexual crimes against three women, the president said that the Democrats used their own claims for their own purposes.
"They are determined to return their power with all possible means.
Look at the disrespect, shamelessness, they don't care who they're gonna hurt who they're going to get over to get their power and control back," said the president in Mediaite.
Elite League: Dondy Stars 5-3 Belfast Janets
Patrick Duyer noticed two holes for Janets against Dondy.
Dondy Stars returned for the fifth loss in Elit League against Belfast Janets, winning a row in Dondy with 5-3 on Saturday.
Janets was in a fight with two naked men after a hit by Patrick Duyer and Francis Bovilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kauni were equal to the housekeepers before Duyer restored Janet's forehead.
Francoa Bushhar is equal to Dondy before Lucas Lundwald Nilsen's two goals confirm their victory.
This is the third victory in the Elit League for Adam Kiff's boys who got out of the bottom to win Dondy in Belfast at 2-1 p.m.
That was the fourth break between the opponents of this season, as Janets won the previous three matches.
The hit with which Duyer discovered the result came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with Kendall McFoul's assistance, and then David Rutherford doubled his advance as assistant to Bovilier four minutes later.
It was the forced start, Sullivan returned the homes back to the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped to compare with Kauni's help at 15:16.
Duyer was trying to take Janets before the first break, marking the second round for the evening at the end of the first half.
The housekeepers regrouped and Bushhar re-emerged the chances of a powerful blow in the door at 27:37.
Kauni and Charles Corcoran have combined efforts to help Nilsen give Dondy the prize for the first time this match at the end of the second half, as he gave everything himself and confirmed the win of the team with the fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
Janets, who lost the last four matches of a total of five meetings, met as Dominion Milton Kins for his next match on Friday.
The flight guide is dead to make sure that hundreds of lives on board the plane can escape earthquakes
The flight manager in Indonesia is commended as a hero, after he died, guaranteeing that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board has managed to fly safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are unconscious in a powerful earthquake that struck the island of Slavazi on Friday, triggering wave tsunamis.
Strong secondary storms continued to affect the area, and many were caught in a trap from the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues had fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the third control tower at Mutirara Sis Al-Jufri Airport.
He stayed on the spot to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the track at that time, would be able to fly safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he decided he was moving.
He died in the hospital later.
The air control speaker, Indonesia, Johannes Siritt, said that this decision may have saved hundreds of lives reported by ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands, after the disaster response agency in the country announced that access to the cities of Dongala, Siggi and Butong is limited.
"We assume that the number of deaths will increase, as many bodies are still under the cracks, and so many people can't reach," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The waves, which reached six feet [6 m], left the Palu, where there was a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry supplies and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, shared before Sky News: "Every minute the line is still dead.
There's a lack of clean water.
There's nightmares everywhere in the minimarkets."
Jan Helfand, president of the International Movement of the Red Cross in Indonesia, said before CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is struggling to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widado arrived in Palu on Sunday and turned to the country’s army: “I ask you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year Indonesia was buried by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane Disaster in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini reports that one person is unconscious after an aircraft crash in the Laguna
The plane that flew with a plane that crashed into the Thai ocean now reports that one man has been declared missing since earlier said that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the landing plane.
In a press release Air Niugini said they can't contact a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airlines added that they work with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their attempts to find a man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details for passengers, such as age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue passengers and crew, after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, the authorities reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The plane reported that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, as everyone was in a stable condition.
They leave no clear reason for the disaster and the exact sequence of the event.
Both the U.S. military forces, both the airlines, said that the plane had crashed into the plane just before the track.
Some of the witnesses thought that the plane was underway.
American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, says the plane's gone very low.
"This is extremely good," says Janes.
Jens says he and the others have managed to cross the deep into the water line to get to the emergency exits of the crashing plane.
He said that the studs fell into panic and screamed, as well as that he suffered from mild headaches.
The U.S. military forces say that mariners remounting the port near have also helped in the rescue operation using an overhaul boat to cross people to the shore before the plane falls to the depths of about 30 meters (100 feet).
The data from the Air Safety Network suggest that 111 people have died during the last two decades in flights with planes registered to PNG, but Air Niugini has not been included in any case.
Analyzing presents the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor concluded with her statement on the case this week in the retrial against a man who was accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Roulette from the U.S. Ministry of Justice has been bearing witness for hours as an expert witness in the field of awareness analysis.
He told the jury how he used phone records to record the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinn Telis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Roylet said he got data on the location of several mobile phones showing that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers by the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to ask Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court on Saturday and evidence that he was out of town this day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Telis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck the same night, Sanford said that "this is a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding is that Telis said he knew Chambers two weeks before her death.
The phone records say they've known each other for just a week.
Roylet found out that shortly after the death of Chambers Telis, he deleted her text messages, calls and contact information on his phone.
"He left her alive," said Hail.
It's planned to start protection with its closing instructions on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be presented before the judges later the same day.

The next blackmail?!
A bride from New York judges a couple after firing for a "racist" message
A bride from New York judge twice for a divorce because of discrimination after she got the wrong message from her mother, who complains she's "an ordinary blacksmith".
The two refuse to be racists, calling out the demand for "extreme".
Linzi Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was smiling when she realized that the new nurse, Jisel Morris, was a blacksmith when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"I DON'T KNOW, THE FRENCH QUEEN," wrote in a text message Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, and that's twice.
After realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, pointing out that the former African-American grandmother had not done the job well and that she was expecting a Filipino, reports New York Post.
Mrs. Morris received a reward for a working day after she was sent home with a cab.
Now Morris judges the double compensation for the fire, demanding the amount of $350 a day for the six-month contract for which she was originally hired, although she did not have a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't have to do that," she said before Post Friday, adding, "I'm sure this is discrimination."
In response to the request, the couple claimed that they were not racists, adding that the termination of Morris' employment was the reasonable act, since they feared that they would not be able to trust her after they tried.
"My wife sent something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said Mr. Joel Plasco in front of Post's husband.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you tried, even if it was a mistake?
You're a newborn?
Think about it."
Comparing the demand for “difficulty”, Plasco says that his wife was born just two months ago and settled in “a very difficult situation”.
“Are you going to attack someone in this state?
This is not particularly nice," the investment banker added.
While the case is still under review, the public opinion quickly condemns the couple on social networks, questioning their conduct and logic.
Podington's publishers were afraid readers would not feel a connection with the talking sword, discovering a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Yankel, was born shortly after the book was accepted from the public, says of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
Now it's very fun, after we know about the great success of Padington."
She explained that her father, who worked as an operator for BBC before he was inspired to write the child book on a small game game, would feel optimistic about the possible rejection of the book, adding that he was presenting the 60th year of publication of the book "with mixed feelings" after his death last year.
With regard to Padington, whom she describes as “an important member of our family”, she added that her father suddenly felt proud of the ultimate success.
"He was a very modest man and was not self-appreciative," she said.
"But since Paddington felt so real, it's just like having a child that's got something: you're proud of him, even though it's not your job.
I think you've somehow taken Padington's success this way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always recorded the benefits of Padington's own."
My daughter was dying, and I was supposed to meet her on the phone.
After her daughter was shot, she was rushed to the hospital in Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors had fought hard to save her life.
"He kept calling to say that the situation was really bad that he didn't expect to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz.
"Then Nad called me to say he's gonna die in two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, “Dad, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
I'll come with you.
The medications given to her by the doctors to maintain her heart slowly stop functioning and leave the system.
She's gone for a while before this and that's how it's all over.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that all of this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
It was supposed to be a trap."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who still cares about her daughter's loss, is riding on the plane with other passengers who have no idea of the test she's going through.
"No one understood," she shared.
"I was wearing my head, and all the time my tears fell.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I've experienced this profound feeling of participation with Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Scurrying women set up cards to prevent suicides from the bridge
Two women, who lost their loved ones because of suicide, are trying to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphris put on a bridge in Wells with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old from Lidney, says her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by the smile.
They've always said that his smile burns every room."
However, he gave up his job before leaving and found himself in “the real darkness. ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm always worried that this will have some effect."
Mrs. Davis creates the cards, “to know people have someone to go and talk to, even to be a friend.
Do not keep silence, you must speak."
Mrs. Humphris, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her partner in life for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He did not share that he felt depressed or depressed or anything else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his country.
He came to the bottom of Christmas, when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look at them, nor did he look at them."
She explained that this was a terrible tragedy for them, but they had to do: “This opens the door to a family meal.
We're breaking up.
But we have to go ahead and fight."

Bret Kavano's future is at stake after the FBI's investigation begins.
I wondered if we could really achieve what he wanted – a limited length and limited scope research – maybe we could combine our efforts," Mr. Fleck said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the Commission would "disappear" in spite of the party blockade.
Why did Mr. Kavano and his supporters not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their lack is due to the moment themselves.
The early elections are only after five weeks, on 6 November – if the Republicans are expected to be not well represented, they will seriously harm their attempts to be elected their representative in the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called the senators, urging them to support Mr. Kavano, who works for Mr. Bush at the White House and with his help he met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has prepared its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are present.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavano can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pens to declare equality and confirm his candidate for the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea "major" at Kim
South Korean legislator claims that the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Chen Unu came to power seven years ago.
Park Bieong Sug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of the Union, said there were 1127 refugees last year, compared to 2011 they were 2706.
According to Mr. Park, the more stringent border control between North Korea and China, as well as the higher sums required by human contractors, are the key factors.
There's no official comment from Phenyan.
Most Northese refugees finally get citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have passed the illegal border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and passes easier than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) that divides the two roots.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, as being often forced to repatriate them.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still in war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month the heads of State of the two countries met in Phenyan for talks focused on the stand in the negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after a historic meeting between US President Donald Tromp and Kim Chen Unu in Singapore, where they agreed in general to work on the Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho accused the US of lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will not be confident in our national security and in these circumstances there is no first way to be alarmed unilaterally," Mr. Rey said in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Cavano "extreme" and said it was not suitable for service in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority at Congress Nancy Pelosi called the candidate for Supreme Court Bret Cavano "extremely" and said he was too uneven to serve in the Supreme Court .
Pelosi commented on this during an interview this week at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"There was no way to think that if a woman had responded in this way, they would call her "extremely," Pelosi said about her reaction to the witness testimony of Kawano before the Senate's legal commission on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally rejected the allegations that he had made a sexual visit to Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when both were teenagers.
During his introduction, Cavano was very emotional, at moments he almost cried and felt as he discussed his family and school years.
He also categorically condemned the democracies in the Commission, calling the allegations against him "a gross and coordinated attack on personality", organised by liberals, who are dissatisfied that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi concluded that according to Cavano's testimony, he is not able to work in the Supreme Court, since it has become clear that he has been warned about democracy.
"I think he himself is disqualified by these claims and by the way he pursues the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi rejected her when they asked if she would try to discredit Cavano if he was appointed and if the Democrats were to receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so - if he does not tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he is not only in the Supreme Court but also in the court in which he is now," Pelosi said.
At present, Cavano is a judge at the Appeals Court in Washington.
Pelosi added that she was concerned at the quality of the democracy about the Kawano's potential decisions concerning the Law on access to health care or the "Roo v. Wade" case, since it is considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kavano had avoided questions about whether he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for a great, prudent man to enter the court and wait for us to say, "is it not wonderful," Pelosi concluded.
And women have to rule themselves.
It's a basic criticism, after months and years of bursting of anger, and she can't accept it without crying.
"I cry when we're angry," said Mrs. Steinom 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I received great help from a woman who was an executive director somewhere who shared that she cried when she was mad, but she developed her technique, thanks to which when she was mad and crying, she said to her relative, "You might think I'm sad because she cried.
I'm mad."
And then it's just going on.
I've decided that's great."
The wounds are allowed to express anger, often because they are misunderstood at first.
One of the clearest memories I have of my previous job, in office primarily with a man, is how once I was caught by unexplained anger, an older woman grabbed me by the door – a stinking guide from which I was always a little scared – and she attracted me to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and they'll be enough that they've caused it."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship with the horse called "Monkey Business", and withdrew from the contest, Mrs. Shrøder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why he would not consider the idea of candidates for the president himself.
"It wasn't a good idea," she told me 30 years later, laughing.
"There were already seven other candidates in the contest and the last thing they wanted to do was to show up another one.
Someone called the "Snejanka" situation and sevenjujets.
Since she is later involved in the campaign, she is leaving with the fund-raising and decides that she will not stay in the deal if she fails to collect $2 million.
The battle has been foretold for failure.
She realizes that some of her supporters, who give $1,000 to men, would just give $250 to her.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
During her speech, in which she claims that she will not continue with an official campaign, she is overwhelmed by so many feelings – gratitude to the people who have supported her, discontent against the system, which makes it so difficult to collect money and you can turn to the voters, not to the delegates, as well as angry against the sexists that she felt.
"A man may think I've got a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Shrøder as the media responded.
"Someone might think Kleneex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what would be written on my grave plate?
"She's crying?"
How the US-China Trade War Can Serve in Beijing
The first shots in the US-China trade war were disgusting and, as the battle narrows its pace, a division between the two countries will benefit Beijing in a long-term plan, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, shot the first warning blow this year, putting on taxes key elements of China's export, including solar panels, stone and aluminium.
The biggest increase in pressure came this week with the new myths, which relate to production of 200 billion US dollars (150 billion British pounds) with an effective tax burden of half of all goods imported into the United States of China.
Each time Beijing turned against new targets with five to ten percent of US dollars' worth of $60 billion.
China has been called back on every US hit and soon the second world economy is not expected to deny it.
To force Washington to give up means to submit to demands, but to surrender his head publicly before Washington will be too ashamed of Si Djin, China's president.
And yet, experts say, if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure from the US trade war can help China's long-term plan to reduce mutual dependence on both economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington and Beijing can create conditions for economic crisis in some of the two countries is actually more dangerous than observers had recognized before," said Abigail Grace, a scholar on issues related to Asia's expert group Centre for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, the Foreign Minister said
Syria said it was ready for the voluntary return of refugees and prayers for assistance in the restoration of the war-free country for more than seven years.
Turning to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mulam said that conditions in the country improved.
"Today's position is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress we have in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas left by terrorists to restore them to their normal state.
Now there are all conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country that were forced to leave because of terrorism and the foreign economic measures that affected their daily life and food.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who still live there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mulalem said that the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in restoring the abandoned country.
But he stressed that there would be no conditional support or assistance from the countries that had financed the rebels.
Europe Wins a Radar Cup in Paris
The European team won the "Rayer Cup" for 2018, with the US final result of 16.5 to 10.5 of "Le Golf National" in the suburbs of Paris, France.
This is how the United States has six regular losses on European countries and has not won the "Rader Cup" in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the champion crown to the tournament, after the team led by the Danish captain Thomas Bourne reached the necessary 14.5 points that guaranteed the victory over the United States.
The U.S. star, Phil Michaelson, who was weak in most of the tournaments, sent his first hit on the 16th floor (with "pair") in the water with which he lost his sword against the French Molinarians.
The Italian golfer Molinari was well presented in all rounds, becoming one of the four players in the history of the tournament, reaching a balance 5-0-0 since the contest took place in the current form after 1979.
American Jordan Spit lost a category of 5&4 players in the European team, located at the lowest point in the ranking – Torbourn Olesen from Denmark.
World ranking leader Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 of Yon Poulter from England, for whom this is probably the last part of the "Rader Cup".
Spanish Serhio Garcia, a veteran with eight participants in the "Rader Cup", has become a European with the most winning points in the tournament for all time, increasing its activity to 25.5 points this year.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't keep myself.
It was a hard year.
I'm extremely grateful to Thomas for calling and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can lift the purchase again.
Above all, the team is the most important and I am happy that I was able to help," said the excited Garcia after Europe's victory.
He's giving his cousin John Ram's chair, who won the American legend Tiger Woods with 2&1 on Sundays.
"I'm incredibly proud that I won Tiger Woods, but I grew up while I watched him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all his four swords in France, and his total balance of Rayder Cup is already 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the biggest players for all time have won 14 big titles – a indicator that only leaves Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team was experiencing difficulties throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Ryde, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed a high-class golf every day from the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furic shared after the disappointment of the team: “I was proud of these guys, they fought.
Once this morning, we pressed the European team.
There was a battle.
I'm taking Thomas' hat off.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players presented themselves very well.
We will regroup, discuss important issues with the U.S. Professional Golf Association and our Radar Cup Committee, and we will only look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
There's no way you can get your opponent's hat off.
We were just playing."
New red tide: Concentrations reduce in Pinellas, Manuti and Sarasota
The latest report of the Committee on Fisheries and Wild Animals in Florida shows a major reduction in the concentrations of redfish in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the Committee, there are reports on conditions for the decline of growth in the areas of the Pinellas, Manuti, Sarasota, Charlotte and Koller – this shows a reduction in concentrations.
Water stations with a supercolored red tide are distributed to approximately 130 miles across the coast, from the northern region of Pinellas to the southern region of Lee.
Participants with hydrogens can be seen 10 miles from the coast of Hillsbury, but they are less than last week.
Red tide is also observed in the area of Pasco.
Over the past week there are data on moderate concentrations in the coastal area or a little more in the area of Pinella, low to high concentrations in the vicinity of Hillsburro, high concentrations in the area of Manuti, high concentrations in the coast or in the area of Sarasota, moderate concentrations in the circle of Charlotte, high concentrations in the coast or below in the area of Lea and low concentrations in the area of Collier.
There is still information about the explosions of the respiratory pathways in the Pinellas, Manuti, Sarasota, Lee and Koller districts.
There have been no reports of respiratory seizures in North-West Florida last week.
