Semilars v. Prosecutors: The Cassation of the former Vice-President of Tartu will be held on 4 August
This means that a decision on it will be made, at least at the beginning of September.
The courts of the first two institutions rejected the application of Semilarski, but in April its appeal was filed by the State Court.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complainant ' s complaint, since it did not enter into his jurisdiction as an administrative court.
The court ' s decision indicated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damage caused during criminal proceedings.
“Resolved such matters should be procurator and court,” explained the ERR press secretary of the Tartu Court, Anett Creetsmann.
In her statement, Valvo Semilarski appealed to the District Court, which did not change the decision of the Court of First Instance on 5 February.
Now you have to tell Gossud.
According to the lawyer of Semilarski, a lawyer, Olivier Nyes, his client had been unjustly suspected of having been involved for about two years.
He now calls on the prosecutor to refute false claims in his address and to replace him with moral damage.
The reason for the complaint in court was the prosecutor's statement on the special cases of the Lebanese District Prosecutor Margus Grossa, made in October 2017 when Semilarski, together with others at the time, was detained by the Deputy mayor Tartu Artem Suvorov, for questioning several crimes.
"I remember that when I was arrested, the police immediately organized a press conference and informed the whole Estonian Republic that the leaders of Tartu, one of the most influential local self-government authorities, were selling.
These aired public suspicions followed me for about two years.
And now that these claims and suspicions have been false, the prosecutor does not want to say anything about them," Semilarski commented early in August 2019.
According to Olivier Ness, the prosecutor rose to the press conference within the legal framework in which the prosecutor was to act.
"The claim of loans and sales has been false, but this is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its resolutions on Russia and Lithuania that the State representatives should be careful when choosing words not to be represented as suspects before the execution of the sentence.
The prosecutor also demands the assumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not respected in this case against Valvo Semilarski," said Nees.
“The public representation of Semilarski as a serious offender and a hostage in circumstances where facts on the basis of suspicion are still made clear that it is not acceptable to contradict the notion of innocence and injustice against the complainant,” the lawyer added.
As ruse.err.ee wrote, former Vice-President Tartu Valvo Semilarski would not be able to draw on the responsibility of charges of detention - the criminal case against him in July was partially closed.
At the same time, the former officer was accused of knowingly violating anti-corruption law in the conduct of transactions in a particularly large amount.
According to the charge, from 2015 to 2017, the former Deputy Mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in city administration meetings in making decisions relating to companies operating in Tartu, with the owners or managers of which Semilarski was actively engaged at the external level.
According to Grossa, in all these cases, Semilarski had personal interests and therefore had to refrain from taking part in the decision-making process.
Previously, as he wrote rus.err.ee, the prosecutor had expressed doubts about the acquisition and violation of anti-corruption legislation in the conduct of transactions in particular large amounts.
This occurred in October 2016 when he was detained along with another deputy, Mr. Artem Suvorov (Central Party).
The Attorney General and the Security Police then stated that there was strong evidence against both Vice-Presidents.
After that, both officers were fired.
The case of Suvorov was later brought to court, which had completely justified the policy.
The case of Valvo Semilarski is still pending.

How the decision of the CB to reduce the key rate affects the economy
The Bank of Russia is waiting again to reduce the key rate.
It was still down to 0.25 per cent, up to 4.25 per cent of the year - formally limited historical minimum.
The regulator will consider the economic prospects more optimistic than ever before when it comes to the return of a short reduction of the rate, as well as the tone of CB declarations and updated forecasts for the Russian economy.
This means that the current cycle of monetary and credit policy mitigation can be stopped soon.
"We have continued to mitigate monetary and credit policy, firstly taking into account that the risk of inflation remains low from 4 per cent in 2021," reported the head of the Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullin.
They are linked to a significant reduction in economic activity, domestic and external demand.
The recovery of the economy, Nabiullin said, would take more than half a year.
She noted that following the removal of the restrictions on the pandemic, economic processes were alive: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand, construction and output of consumer goods had been restored, the annual rates of reduction in transport, production had been reduced.
According to the CB's clear forecast, the economic downturn in 2020 is 4.5-5.5 per cent (expected 4-6 per cent) and the economic recovery growth in 2021 is 3.5 to 4.5 per cent, and 2.5 to 3.5 per cent in 2022.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the annual oil prices forecast to $38 and $40 for the Urals barrier in 2020 and 2021 respectively.
Previously, the CB had expected $27 and $35 for the barrel.
Finally, the 2020 inflation forecast of the Russian Bank was 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The outlook of the Bank of Russia on the economic situation is more optimistic, which draws us closer to the end of the drying cycle, the economists of Russia and the SNG Reness Capital, Sofia Donez and Andrey Melaštenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has consistently reduced the key rate for more than a year, and since the beginning of last summer, it has already dropped to 3.5 per cent.
At the last meeting in June, the CB suddenly reduced it to one percentage point due to low inflation due to the demand for demand and the need to stimulate the slowdown due to the pandemic and the economic constraints associated with it.
The opportunities for monetary and credit policy are maintained (at the next meeting on 18 September and by the end of the year), but the main analysis of Rosbank Evgen Košelev has been agreed.
The pool of inflational risks also indicates the proximity of a break in the mitigation of a per cent policy - broken supply chains, the possible increase in costs due to measures to prevent the epidemic and faster (as expected) recovery of demand, he says.
The following activities of the Bank of Russia require greater attention to the inflation process during the harvest season, as well as to the external wave of geopolitical conflicts, which has increased in the background of the conflict, as indicated by Košelev.
Otherwise, lowering the key rate will lead to further lowering rates for the most reliable employees, as well as possibly, the senior analyst of the bank's analytical management, Max Petronević, says.
The correction of the rate would be less pronounced than the reduction of the rate.
Consumer credit rates may fall to another 0.3-0.6 percentage point during the second half of the year, mortgage rates may end year in the range of 6.2-7 per cent, except for BCS Prime Minister Anton Pokatovic.
The average contribution rates, he believes, will also fall - in the coming months they may fall to 4.2 to 4.5 per cent (now barely more than 4.5 per cent).

The Podmosk authorities have spoken about the fate of closed doors
In the Netherlands, solid home wastes continue to be closed.
This year the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing clusteres are modernized in modern mousroso-operating complexes.
But this may not be the case for every polygon - many of them have grown a flat roof.
After the polygonal is closed, it is formed into a reculpture, and the polignon is covered with roots, the degasation system and the infiltration of the infiltrate are installed.
This enables the chemical processes to be stopped inside the shells so that it does not break, it does not cause harm, it does not drain soil and groundwater.
And then the ex-shirt remains a useless dog in the midst of its living nest.
Why don't you do something useful from her?
For example, in Russia, where the cultivation of the "Annino" mill has been literally completed in days, the authorities are considering the option of making a mountain floor from a cave.
This polygon, operating from 1976 to 2016, is growing beyond the boundaries of the land under it.
Therefore, it was necessary to purchase neighbouring sites, which had been already lost by the musher.
"Sometime it's going to happen, the pole will "sit down," it's gonna get stronger, and we'll think that we can do what it can to get started.
It's going straight into the eye, it's a mountain resort," told the journalists of the Russian district head Nikolai Parfenov.
Two polygons will become areas for renewable energy sources

"Timhovo" will produce 72.5 million hours of time and will continue to work as a mousrooperating complex.

This is the opinion of British MIDA Toinby, who believes that it is embarrassing to think so.
And those who believe all over the place of prayer.

The actor of the Russian series responded to charges of "promotion of LGBT and feminism"
The actor of the Russian Chiki series, who was accused of “proclaiming LGBT and feminism”, responded to the film’s claim.
The authors "considered the burden of the subjects raised and did not want to offend anyone," American Steven Thomas Oxner said in a paper entitled "Go".
"I think it's a story of the strength and general aspects of human life.
It's nothing about LGBT and feminism," said an actor playing the father of a boy who moved into a woman's clothes.
He stressed that he was proud of his work and that he did not consider it a propaganda.
At the same time, an American added, he was afraid of the reaction of some people to a series line: for example, when "a man in deep sleep shot a single square and said it was all wrong."
"There were a couple of cases when we met people who didn't understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so the people who started coming with the claims began to help us," he said.
