At the end of the exchanges, the Prague Bascula exchange in the negative
After the fall tomorrow morning, Prague's bourse rectifies its losses.
Transactions with ČEZ actions reach almost half the usual daily exchanges.
Tuesday, from the start of the exchanges, Prague's boutique refurbishes with its downside of the guard, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the drop is due to the drop of actions in Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the US Chamber of Representatives, which refuses to adopt the US financial sector stabilisation plan, is also understandable to us.
Action cuts in Asia
Asian bourgeoises are experiencing a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even if the indicators succeed in removing part of the losses during the day.
Hong Kong's Hong Kong Bourse index is four percent lost during the exchanges, but later it removes some of the losses and reduces the drop to almost 2.5 percent.
The Hong Seng China Enterprises, following the move of the Chinese operations of the Hong Kong branch, lost 3.8 per cent, the markets were closed in Shanghai.
The actions of Sydney's boutique were more than five per cent, but finally we managed to reduce the losses to 4.3 per cent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Forum lost 3.6 percent.
"The harassment of the rescue action in the United States will affect the financial markets around the world," observed Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, he has established his own monetary policy, that is, independently of the Chinese Central Bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong have the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the financial system support proposal.
Otherwise, other countries would risk being affected.
The Blood Bay of American Actions
Monday, the House of American Representatives rejected the financial system support project, which it had to spend up to $700 billion (about 12 billion in Kč).
The legislators are thus calling for the support of President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should address the main causes of the financial crisis and help to stabilize the whole economy.
American actions live, Monday, a blood bath, and the main indicators of action are the biggest drop in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index was lost almost seven percent, having experienced a fall in such a cave for the last time in 1987.
The index was already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was free of charge.
Congress passed: U.S. government can inject $700 billion in banks
The heads of file of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of financial assistance agreement to the American financial system.
He will be voting in the beginning of next week.
American legislators conducted a decisive turnout in discussions on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial aid amounting to $700 billion (about 12 billion) provided to the US financial system.
Success is not so sure.
In fact, before the final version of the law can be published and voted, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The support plan for the financial system will be discussed Monday at the Chamber of Representatives.
He said Sunday to Reuters Barney Frank, chairman of the Board's banking and financial regulation committee.
According to sources, early Wednesday should be the first to be submitted to the Senate vote.
According to the economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be the first major psychological factor to weaken the financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which market aid can be effective, it will follow a "disillusion".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent opinions about the form of the package of measures for market stabilization," Commissioner Nancy Pelosi told the Bloomberg Agency.
According to it, the final vote could be taken on Sunday.
On Saturday evening at Sunday afternoon, representatives of the legislators met with the Minister of American Finance Henry Paulson to give the Government a final form.
The latter should purchase, to financial companies, the immovable property assets that lead financial enterprises to significant losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are on the point of agreeing on a plan that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
We still need to continue this market recovery plan, but I think we are," said Paulson.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a considerable impact on the markets of actions that fall.
According to the Democrat Senator Harry Reid, the legislators make it possible for Congress to conclude a final agreement on Sunday.
They therefore want to calm the investors before the start of trade in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the decision of the Congress could have an impact on Monday's trade.
But, for the moment, it is impossible to specify with certainty when the two Members of the American Congress will proceed to the vote, even if negotiations are not likely to be blocked, at the last moment, by such a problem or problem.
The legislators expect it to be adopted in the coming days.
However, the law is still subject to changes.
The total amount allocated to the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
However, if Congress will have the impression that the programme does not fulfil its function, it is possible to block the grant of the remaining amount, following two steps: firstly, $100 billion additional, then, to conclude, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush sells progress in negotiations
Although the President may put his will to that decision, the Congress has the opportunity to put him in the minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the programme, which was to obtain funding for the capture of the bad real estate securities, including the value of the loss, was that hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages.
"All the work is done.
The Chamber of Representatives should be able to proceed on Sunday in the voting of the law, and the Senate Monday," said the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President George Bush himself enjoys progress in negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Mr. Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the shared effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Delimitation of sweet oranges
The President of the Banking Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, a negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of contributors against losses, the agreement of deterioration, the implementation of the plan on the axis of time.
The new Act also provides for the limitation of payrolls for directors of companies participating in the programme and for the establishment of a committee, which will ensure the supervision of the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on the issue and made significant progress towards an agreement that will go forward and be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also provides for assistance for real estate owners, who have problems to pay.
The Government should negotiate new accounts in the event of mortgages it will buy, while reducing the monthlyities of the debtor and allowing the latter to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological Aid
According to Patria Finance Chief, David Marek's proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that we are unaware of what the mechanism and the price of asset recovery will be.
This will be determined to cut off the share of losses between the financial sector and the government," says Marek, this week, to the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan is now adopted, or at the beginning of next week, it is not, according to Marek, as important as that.
"It is much more important that Congressmen agree this week to support this plan and that they will devote it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, is most important at this time," Marek points out.
An extreme struggle: MP3 players against mobiles.
We'll advise you how to choose
While practically all mobiles can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
It seems clear that it is best to buy only one phone.
It does not prevent there are enough reasons to search for an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a high-level gramophone to set up the new album by Maxim Turbulenc.
On the other hand, such music products do not appear on a glass disc, and, in terms of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
But if there's in your walls of vinyl discs stretched, with rock art, jazz or blues, you probably dream of a gramophone like that.
The same is true of music during the movements, namely compressed music, to say in a simple way - music in MP3.
There are also categories of price and quality.
For one thing, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, in the same way that a Pink Floyd fan would have the wrong to support customers bought for twenty crowns in the market.
There are two extremes, among which there is enough space for the whole world.
The choice is wide.
Battery life is also critical
Some high-level music readers are capable of much more than a simple music reader, but there are unknown functions of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as your phone.
With the first functions, the phone calls and the sending of SMS, it is able to read music and movies, to record these last ones, it has a camera of variable quality, and it can, for example, be used for navigation.
And if you take the smartphones and the comms into account, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator knows the meat's throat and no TV will take pictures, we actually attend a miracle.
But the universal character of the mobile is not inconceivable.
The greater the number of functions you use, the more the range between two recharges will be reduced.
And music reading is one of the most important energy sinks.
The mobiles that are able to read music for 10 to 12 hours are rare, in most cases, this number is quite low.
In this regard, music (especially the most rudimentary) players are much more effective.
In the case of well-marketed mobiles, be sure they'll only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you are able to call time in time, find out, to be up, a second recharge for work - which is even valid for the most expensive devices.
This problem will not happen to MP3 readers, who are able, following a recharge, to continue functioning at least 9 hours, including the least performance.
Another problem arises when music is recorded in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, so much more that not all can be directly connected to the computer without a special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to take it without reducing it, given the minor sizes of memory cards used in mobiles.
As for readers, you do not need any software except iPod.
It's enough to complete the music device from the computer through the USB connector.
Most mobiles and readers will create themselves a media library classified by the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the style, or then by the user's judgment.
Some devices show that a tree structure index, like Windows Explorer, is capable of two (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobiles have more know-how
In selecting a specific device, you are particularly interested in the life of the accumulator, the memory capacity, the quality and type of output of the device and, of course, the ease of the command.
If music is for you, essentially, a sound of the background and if in the day you are going to hear that for a limited period of time, for example by taking the tram, you have enough of any mobile reading MP3.
Virtually all mobile phones are now capable.
You have not even had to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or the reader is able to read.
All arrive to read the MP3s and the large majority of music that will reach until you have this format.
It is part of the most advanced formats, and besides it, the vast majority of the devices are also reading WMA format music.
The AAC (format used by Apple firm and its iPods), as far as it is concerned, is less current.
High-range mobiles also allow, for example, online music purchase.
It is enough to visit the operator’s (or other supplier’s) website from the mobile phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason for seeking a musical mobile.
The offer of operators is unfortunate and it limits, in most cases, to radio tubes quickly made.
Prices are no longer lower.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether via GSM, internet, wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their own mobile.
Every time you wanted to hear something, you just got out of your pocket's cell phone, while you forgot your MP3 player at home.
But it is also important if you always have audiences or a hand-free with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use integrated inputs, which have practically all mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 readers.
For many, the main benefit of musical furniture is their price.
The lowest rates usually cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three and four thousand crowns, a walkman can already be very convenient.
Or, in most cases, you will be limited by lack of output for ordinary audiences.
The price of the best telephones and the best outlets, as well as an entry for ordinary audiences, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
The readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy command.
Surely no one who comes to ensure the order of the most rude readers - who do not necessarily correspond to the least loved ones (see our choice).
A minimum function; and the comparison of the order with that of a tape item, used in the past, or a gramophone, is evident.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mobile internet branched by Hasard, followed by an enormous data transmission factor.
Which device to choose
Even the most expensive mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you are not going to exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models support in principle only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most dear ones come out with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and you want to buy a good MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or a well iriver.
Depending on capacity (max. 2 GB), you must not spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are part of the most demanding audiences, choose specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent command clicks for MP3, and this is how the layout of the command is closer to that of an independent MP3 reader.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that is the farest away in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a life span of the accumulator (usually 15 hours up to 35 hours) above, is secured by a MP3 reader produced by one of the above brands.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Other
The mobile market in Czechia is relatively advanced, our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, we still lack the same thing - a virtual operator, who would force classic operators to lower prices.
He may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned, at times, on Mobile.cz the fact that Czech operators are part of the most expensive in Europe.
The ČTÜ (Techéque des Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of a SMS was higher in us than in the rest of the Union, has also confirmed it.
This is why, following the recent failure of the European Commission in the area of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to arise - SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of Czech mobile operators less expensive than in the country.
How is it possible to maintain prices in Czechia so high, compared with Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really want to get into the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, since we have even three mobile networks and a penetration exceeding 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this connection, Pavel Dvorák, President of the Czech Telecommunications Office (CHT), stated several times that there was no room for another operator in Chequia, made a mess with the operators.
It is probably true that a classic operator with his own network does not appear to have more chance (and, at the present time, he would only find the frequencies difficult).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is just the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that has led to a considerable drop in prices, which should therefore also be the reaction of the classic operators.
However, even before the entry of parties such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, voices similar to those we hear today were allowed to be heard in Great Britain.
However, it appears that he was left of the place for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We are no longer obliged to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch, in Poland, of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In six months alone, this operator has succeeded in gaining over 100 thousand customers and becoming the fifth operator of the country.
We add that behind the Mobilking, there is the Penta financial group, which is also owned by the U:fon in Czechia.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more specific target group.
In order to be effective, they need much less customers than a classic operator.
In fact, they are relatively high without cost of construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
This is also the case in the world, virtual operators define themselves as low-cost operators - they offer high-market calls and SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMSs at least twice as expensive as its competitors in Great Britain.
But, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, working on an unusual target group can also be a good part of advertising.
In fact, this operator specifically refers to men.
"The real men choose Mobileking - an operator that they like and they can trust," said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept could be possible to walk with us as well.
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone's spokesman, is undoubtedly: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmentary approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
It is more than relatively satisfied with the point of view of the provision of services."
In Czech, no chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in Czechia, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this project successfully, but negotiations in Czechia are not very encouraging.
The launch of Mobilking will rather take place in other countries in our area," said Jana Studničková, the spokesman of the Penta financial group.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in Czechia were not, in any case, in favour of this idea.
Instead, they tried to do their best so that a potential competitor could not appear.
The GTS Novera group, which wanted to launch a new step to become a real Telephonika competitor in the field of business customers, has not been hiding its intention for a long time to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We have much to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services but also mobile ones.
And sooner or later it'll be the best.
We have already held negotiations on this possibility several times with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have made progress in the negotiations," said Paul Kaidl's group spokesman.
So maybe the future is promising.
According to informal information, it seems that we might be able to welcome the first virtual operator already at the end of the year.
But for the moment, his creation is accompanied by total silence.
"At this moment, we do not think there is any place on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is comparable to other very specific ones.
For the moment, no subject of a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," Vlastimil Sršeň of the Telefonika O2 Press Department, in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also relate to the specificity of the Czech market.
The T-Mobile spokesman Martina Kemrová says in a rare agreement with the O2: "We have not registered for a viable and bilateral advantage project, which could serve as a basis."
She added: "It is practically excluded that a virtual operator appears in the T-Mobile network at the end of the year.
In order to operate in a limited period of time, we should now have a specific agreement."
Vodafone rather focuses on meeting requests to obtain its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says in this regard: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructures.
That's what we think means most of our customers' views.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to put in place a common network for a fast mobile Internet."
Responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The trend of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a lower price and therefore a lower benefit.
What, then, is to facilitate the development of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, operators know how to run in the field. The Chinese accompanying the creation of the U:phone also testifies.
The biggest pressure on the ČTú, when the U:fon was created, was exercised by T-Mobile company.
It provides information available to the public on ČTÜ websites.
But today, the U:fon is ready to serve as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted on this subject: "The competition on the mobile market has been, moreover, recently expanded by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of an additional player would subject him, and especially his services, to high requirements."
However, given the attitude of mobile operators here, the lack of Czech regulatory bodies seems to be disinclined.
However, it is not only the ČTÜ's attitude, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, does not unfortunately have the power to intervene in economic competition in Chechnya.
It belongs exclusively to the Agency for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
But the latter adopts, in the face of this problem, its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator concerned regarding the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No agreement of this type has been concluded for the moment, since the offer of potential stakeholders has not given sufficient priority to the classic operators," Kristian Chalupa of the UOHS Department of External Relations answered our question.
A statement thus made would not surprise the representatives of the operators.
However, on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among others, take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, such a statement is more than just misleading.
More than Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the outside, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be noted that their entry into the market has contributed to a low price of mobile telephone services."
However, pressure in terms of fair market functioning and low prices does not appear to be part of the interests of the UOHS.
What is actually shocking is almost the agreement of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question is, if it's really a Hasard, it's all natural.
Similarly, a price of strictly identical essence to all service stations is certainly due to the Hasard and the difficulty in combating competition.
"The Office has therefore not identified signs of anti-competitive behaviour, therefore it has no reason to intervene in any way or other.
None of the operators have a dominant position, no one is therefore responsible for increasing their market behaviour.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably missing even the telecommunications regulator," said Chaloupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many points of dispute.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the ČTÜ, which provides telecommunications, from the point of view of economic competition, one market.
None of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
However, some legal experts offer another vision of things: in order for a virtual operator to be created, the consent of the network operator must be obtained at each time.
And the mobile operator logically has the monopoly on his network.
That is how he must play a dominant role in a certain segment of his activity.
However, even without this argument, it should be at least worrying about the UOHS that three mobile operators appear to be in a similar way.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including GTS Novera, mentioned above) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Responsibilities on the ČTú are a fairly current tour in the communications, through which the ÜOHS washes the hands of the case.
We have already met this kind of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, there has been no success in the revising of the Telecommunication Act, recently adopted, an increase in the power of the TEC in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists had promised to improve the situation.
This is what the representatives of the WHO should know very well, but their interests are obviously on the other side.
When no one looks at it, it can walk
That said, the operation of a variety of virtual pseudo operators, several in Czech mobile networks, remains undiscovered.
This is about companies publishing their own mobile telephone service price list, but these are only partially published.
In most cases, it is a question of firms dealing with multi-level marketing.
Specialized mobile telephone services are thus proposed by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms are generally available only for elections.
The magic tour consists of the fact that the company works in front of the operator is a classic company, which controls a large number of SIM cards.
As an important customer, it receives special prices (and other) offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a return.
"If it were what you're talking about, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions we're considering and could result in an end to collaboration with the company in question," answered our question on this issue, Martina Kemrová.
However, it is unlikely that a result of such activity would not have been achieved until the mobile operators were responsible.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, it can be made up of thousands of customers.
No operator shall, however, object to such procedure.
In fact, the activities of these firms bring non-illegal benefits, and at the same time, contrary to the real virtual operators, they do not threaten them at all with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are only used by a percentage of non-legislable customers.
In addition, they are obliged to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot have it in full, as ordinary clients of mobile operators."
But that is exactly what should appear strange in ČTú.
In addition, there is another question to the UOHS.
If operators are finally moving their eyes on such a procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the OOHS has relatively broad powers to enable it to launch such activities, and if it does not wish to satisfy the explanations of operators, who claim to have no idea what would happen, their contractual conditions prevent it.
When we won't be the dearest country
As we have mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market has resulted in a considerable decline in the price of services.
However, in almost all countries where virtual operators appeared, the classic operators were increasingly forced to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a very small market, too much content, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it is precisely at this level that, in developed countries, regulatory agencies, which did not defend the interests of mobile operators, but those of their clients, were involved.
Both by formal measures and by informal pressure, they have achieved the creation of a first virtual operator followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities deal with this issue in the form of a hot soil pump which is released by transmitting it to a nearby target.
Based on the experiences we have, we cannot escape the impression that confusion in competences is more beneficial in these cases than useful.
But we don't miss after the wedding.
If the coulisse information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear in our home, the Czech mobile market may be back in motion.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the UOHS will be able only to remain insensitive to the rejection (to discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may have stopped calling more than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymne has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech National Hymme.
Sunday, on the occasion of the Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek suddenly presented the new registrations of my national host Kde domov (Where is my homeland?).
The Himmne was again registered by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bélohlávek.
We have four versions - with a single male or female song, an interpretation with a heart and an instrument version.
The song is secured by Katerín Knížinková et Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the immune arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bélohlävek considers the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As already entrusted to Český rrhlas (Czech public radio), he has chosen for the interpretation of single versions of the singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that the two singers, as well as the heart, had a good speech, so that we could understand the words, that they sing simultaneously," he explained.
The Czech national ceremony, next year, is 175th anniversary.
The song Kde dodomov was first held in 1834 on the pianos of Stavovské divadlo (the Theatre of the States) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des savetiers), the original Czech piece of Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of Frantisek Škroup.
It has become popular and people have been able to do it spontaneously.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couple naturally became an integral part of the National Hymme.
It will remain one of the seven national symbols even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
How to use the "new" theme
Common transports (MHDs) will introduce, Wednesday, dust in their ticket system.
Wednesday, 1 October 2008 will be included in the history of Pražský Doravní polnik (the Agency for Transport) as the date on which the first passengers will be shown in the subway, trams and buses, which, instead of having a ticket on paper, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, the latest is available for nearly a hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard Puzzle Card.
The passengers can buy a 30-day or 90-day coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both register on their passports in the information points and offices of the Dovratní businessnik (the Transport Agency), located at the Metro Museum, Móstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Andël, Roztyly, Lettíny, Kobylisy, Rajská Zahrad, Kacherov and Luka.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility of buying coupons online on the Web pages of the Transport Company: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people took advantage of the service during the morning.
Those who start using the online store can definitely forget cookies in the metro stations, where they should still have empathy in long queues in order to get tickets in paper.
In fact, they will buy their coupon online and we will record it on their card Opencard in one of the thirty Mästská knjiovna (municipal libraries).
"In these points of contact, passengers have a cookie with a trained staff, which will help those interested in buying online and, in addition, record the coupon they bought on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrní.
With the libraries, it will also be possible to record electronic coupons on the Opencard in automatic distributors installed in several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, reminding machines to compose tickets and passengers may already have been noted at Roztyly, Budéjoviká, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, it should have four-thirty," adds Opatrní.
An automatic control of the cap at the position of the driver
Automs that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
It's enough to enter the opencard card and the previously purchased coupon will be registered on the card itself.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the surrounding city.
It is known in the periurban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the central Boheme communities to access the capital.
"In the integrated trains in Pražská integrovaná transporta (integrated transport from Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, using which they establish temporary and territorial validity of the coupons," explained the control of the Filip Drapal tickets of the Ropid organization, which includes the hours of common freight.
Periurban buses are equipped with integrated card readers at the driver's box.
It is therefore necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to place the Opencard at the place indicated on the side of the box.
This is how the driver controls the validity of registered coupons.
"Where the passenger would need to verify the validity of registered couples, there is nothing more simple than to ask the driver for this information," Drapal adds.
Passengers who do not take the bus bus and will not remember the date on which their partner’s validity is expressed may re-connect automatic distributors, initially used to record the coupons on the card.
This is where, on the screen of the device, information about the validity of their document will be displayed.
The Soviets claimed a referendum in the United States
In 1945, the Germans of the Sudan demanded that Shuumava be integrated into the United States.
This comes from a letter deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vedeká kníovna (The Scientific Library of the South Boheme).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the U.S. patronage.
In 1945, some groups from Germany of the Sudan addressed the President of the United States with such a wish.
This comes from another letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská védeká knyovna.
The Germans of Český Krumlov point out in the letter that the American President should not allow "shuumavská zupa" (South Bohem forest region) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We well understand the situation and want to be sure that the words proclaim that the American troops are coming to the German territory, not against the oppressors and enemies, but against the liberators," is written in the letter, "People whose fate is in the heart of the Shumava".
Since the relationship with Czechoslovakia is not supposed to be promising - being aware of the Czech national character - but of brutality, indifference, incompetence, oppression and service, the authors of the letter urge the American President to take into his hands the protection of Šumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you will give this territory to a foreign State to us, which will stop and destroy minorities and which has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of the quarter of millions of people," the letter says.
The reason for which the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge by the "Czech printers".
If the President of the United States had doubts about the opinion of the Germans of Šumava, he would have to organize a referendum in the region to determine whether his people wanted to become part of the United States, or to live under the United States patronage.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given the current knowledge of post-war history, appears somewhat naïve, according to some survivors, it well illustrates the expectations of the Germans of the Soviet times.
While the Czech Germans had to at least intervene that the issue of their expulsion from the Republic would be raised, very few of them would have been able to do so.
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would obtain some sort of autonomy for the Soviets.
Others thought they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, not in České Budéjovice, confirmed it.
During the war, he was, as was Germany of České Budéjovice, engaged in the sea in the Baltic States.
At the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the Holstein capture camp, and dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him to learn the Czech language.
"They believed that once they returned home, their Czech would be profitable," said Chalupa.
None of the Germans captured who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, he said, would have been expelled from the Republic following the Beneš Decrees.
You don't think - your countries!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
One way to characterize the emotional media campaign is to launch, Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
The office of Minister Aleš Rébíček believes that it will discourage drivers of dangerous behaviour by flying.
This campaign costing 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on tracts.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and alcohol.
But also remind them to take the seat before starting.
In particular, she wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, modems, pets, without forgetting professional drivers.
What's going to appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
In the witness also the slogan "sangling" of the entire campaign:
You don't think - your countries!
The phrase "You don't reflect" is inserted in upper case on the registration plate.
Then, in a blood bottle, there's the phrase "Your money."
What must symbolize that we can pay attention to life.
The spots will "hand" the viewers until 2010.
The ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can be seen jointly with tragic images of victims of accidents.
It is estimated that this will result in a decrease in the rate of accidents and deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The sugar and lead strategy against drivers
"What goes with drivers is the system of sugar and lead.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by making time when they cry a red fire.
The bullet, it's the threat of an attack or an accident.
The risks must be reminded to drivers," says Martin Kořán, the psychologist for the transport of the Na Homolce hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, which is based on psychology.
Panels indicating the danger to drivers are, according to him, already less effective.
"When a static panel protecting against a danger is installed, it will probably soon merge with the environment and drivers will not notice it anymore," Kořán reports.
Olmert would bring peace to almost all occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the President of the Israeli Provisional Government, announced the return of practically all the territories occupied in 1967, including the Jordan, East Jerusalem and the heights of the Golan, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in a published interview on Monday by Jedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all the territories (occupied), to want them all," Olmert said every day.
"We will maintain a certain percentage of the territory, but we must give the Palestinians an equal percentage (from the Israeli territory), because without it, peace will not be done," he added.
He admits that the possible restoration would mean East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem, and especially does not want any traitors and bulldozers to break his feet, as this has happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up to the parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noted by giving a speech to the two attacks in the city in July, when several people were killed and dozens of wounded.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historical places" located inside the Old City.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't go," he then pointed to it.
Golan height reduction
Olmert also claims that Israel's withdrawal from the Golan heights is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of a withdrawal of the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up in order to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (majorative movement); they will have to give up their constant support for Hamas (major movements) and Al-Qaïda (terrorist network), as well as for Jihad (health war) in Iraq," the Prime Minister specified.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are the Stewarts in the car illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance car is prohibited
In the context of the tragic accident of the Autocar of the Student Agency near Padue, Italy, the question arises as to whether drivers and passengers can move inside the car during the journey.
"If the law was to be strictly and formally respected, the activity of a Stewart is contrary to the road traffic law," said the spokesman of the Department of Transport Karel Hanselka.
The accident, during which a 22-year-old guest died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the road of the car.
The young girl was at this point unfortunately sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats.
However, the driver may have an accident, he wishes to freeze in a harsh manner, also at the time when the Stewart serves coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the auto car is based on its technical file equipped with top-level spaces or not.
If this space equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The long distance cars Student Agency do not have any destinations; what was confirmed in Aktualnë.cz by the company director Radim Jançura.
"It is a question which we have dealt with with with the department and at first it prohibits any movement of passengers.
Then they cancelled it and we found that passengers could go to the toilets during the journey, provided they had their own seat," he explained his position.
The law ignores the Stewart
"There is no uniform legal interpretation of Stewart's role - no legal requirement is involved in this role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement no longer prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transport Act is only known as the vehicle receiver's term; it does not define its rights and duties," adds Hanselka's portal with more ambiguity.
Josef Pokorný, director of the Department of Road Traffic, on the contrary, considers that the law is sufficiently addressing the problem.
"All depends on the fact that if the car is approved, it will be allowed to offer the first place.
Everyone lives here," he said.
Cars are divided into urban areas, where there are limited parking spaces and maximum speed, interurbans with high parking places and a higher authorised speed and in long distances without parking with the highest authorised maximum speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
Like in the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Horín, an expert in BESSIP (the safety of road traffic) safely in transport, does not see the movement of stairs on board as a major problem.
"In a regular movement, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of the service in the aircraft.
Besides, it's not sure when a turbulence occurs and the air's host can be identified."
"Or, in the case where the car would be frozen in a harsh manner, the laws of physics would be clearly valid.
In the same way as in a urban bus or tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of the Stewarts by internal requirements," he said, and he also considers that the problem is not solved from the legal point of view.
Jančura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only car carrier to offer Stewards services.
He owes it two hundred.
Even after this incident, the Director does not consider them to be a risk measure.
"However, as soon as I have the impression that this is a threat measure, I will remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and magazine on board.
It would also reduce costs," he said.
Security concerns are the reason why the absence of Stewarts in his vehicles is given to Asiaan director Alexei Lithuania, who ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We don't have hosts. We've been against them since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end with a fatal accident," he said, a year ago, at Týden.cz.
An immense tragedy has occurred
A young guest in the Plzeň region, who has been working for society for two years, died in an accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck has probably left the emergency stop band without using clichés and has blocked the road to the car.
The driver of the latter to try to avoid him by means of a dirty manoeuvre, but he did it by his right hand.
Jančura refuses that the two seats reserved for the chairs were sold.
"In the case of long lines, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked."
The company has to file a complaint against the driver of the truck.
For the destruction of the family of the young girl, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but in the case of financial compensation, it will also rely on the offender.
A change of law?
No view
An amendment to the law, which has been drawn up for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide details on the movement of drivers on the road.
"Or, she has not reached any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she is not too interested in buses, but rather to the point system, to the maximum speed on the highway and to the use of the laptop on the flight," said expert Horín.
"The Department of Transport does not consider the activities of the Stewarts to be a fundamental threat to passengers' safety," concludes the Hanselka spokesman, stating that road safety control is under the authority of the police and the work security office.
The hope of the Düsseldorfois rests on Frankfurt.
The great words were not missing in the letter addressed by the WestLB Steering Committee to the household staff.
From one of the entities of Düsseldorf's financial institution with the Deka-Bank de Frankfurt, "the central financial market institution of the financial group of the Sparkasse" could be established according to the public performance email Monday.
WestLB would bring a double "competence block" of sustainable productivity in such a case.
However, such a relationship could be the cut-off of sending to other concentrations in the banking sector of the Landers.
This is similar when a Steering Committee intends to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because WestLB, injured, is always under strong pressure.
This is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, which has only recently made it clear to the Government of Northern Rhine-Westphalia that time was involved in researching a future solution.
However, it has been a long time since - also from the side of Frankfurt - has been a relationship between the Deka bank, which was known to the customers of the Sparkasse by their investment funds, and WestLB.
Some of the leaders of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas reported that during the final session of the semester, he saw no meaning in the merger of the house of Mainzer Landstrasse with a bank of Land, whether Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, each half of which is supported by the banks of the Landers and by the Group of Stock Exchanges, has been responsible for conducting talks with WestLB for joint commercial activities.
It could then be the debt of the financial market, or part of it.
The speakers, however, come only to start, said in the financial place.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, with its 3,000 employees, accounts for one of the most important employees on the financial scene in Frankfurt, in the event of the consolidation of the savings sector.
In 2003 it was believed that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Bank of the State of Rhine-Palatinate and Halbab.
There's nothing, however, from this earthly hole.
The plans were, however, publicized that the Government of the Hesse Land was against any participation of Hellaba in them.
As a result, the other two houses were no longer united.
The Bank of the Land of Rhenanie Palatinat was attached to the Bank of Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new treatments on the deka-Bank grouping with Länder banks.
Finally, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Steering Committee of Hellaba, was, however, against any commercial merger strategy with its bank.
Regardless of this, the feeling seems to spread that the grouping of the different public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Parliament of the State of Bavaria has passed, a BayernLB union with the Bank of the State of Bade-Wuttenberg could be established first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure required for new mergers had to be increased, the potential partners would have to get away with it a little.
In the South, she would now be a young partner, although she was even better able to resist the crisis than the Munich and Stuttgart banks.
Hesse-Thuringe's savings and operations group, which has 85 percent of Helaba's capital, has, in turn, taken a widow at the beginning of the year on the whole union with WestLB.
He'd stay at the NorthLB.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one of the faces.
Another faces the question of how the different commercial models of each of these banks can be arranged.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive issue, which is the commercial model of the future capacity of the banks of the Netherlands, had not been resolved until it was resolved by the German group of savings and operations.
In the end, a WestLb pressure may have a position, a pressure which is obviously not desired here.
This is also the case in the letter of the Committee of Directors in place: in any case, there would be a 'global solution' for the establishment.
How all of this will be put in the same panel with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanied her as a little friend, and so nothing is the same, he said.
Behind them, close to a five litre of beer from the Kaiser brand, there is a well built barbu that shows about 200 visitors to the beer festival whose deep sound his master can produce.
Elena knocks first Luca, then hugs her.
From Bologna, they've come to Verone.
From there, from the train station near the new Porta train station, four buses take off this evening at 23h45, `destinazione Monaco, festival della Birra', arrive at 6h30.
Three buses are primarily reserved for Italians, in one of the buses traveling exclusively from Brazil.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sing of gold and already next to their flock, they have already celebrated the last night.
And also funny, Marco Guarda explains, it's not for Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, which carries a long double handle of falsified fur and moons on large silver mountains.
For five years, they've been going to the beer party, three more viruses than this year.
They go out there at night, stay the day at the party, and return at 2:30 a.m.
And spending the night would mean unnecessary expenses, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome port with a Kaiser beer, broken in accordance with the Bavarian cleanup law, sickness insurance and a German-speaking group member - Marco has conducted a language course in Frankfurt.
And the buses are already running at night on the highway direction 'Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Soon, everything gets quiet in the bus, the passengers sleep.
It's better, they'll still need their strength.
There will be breaks in Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian registration plates make another break before Munich, on the 8th highway.
In the early morning, Marco's group finally arrived at six o'clock as planned on the parking near Thérèse, about 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathered, Marco has a final speech, explains the attack plan.
Firstly: it covers the small yellow cassette.
The following is written on the left 'Birth Festival', in Gothic, and on the internet address of Marco's travel agency `conoscersiggiado.it".
Second: 'When the doors of the bed' are open, we're short, Marco cries in the morning.
'Run!' Run and reserve the places at the bottom of the tent.
'Not before, we're not blocking, and not all the yellow caskets on the same banks, they need to be distributed in the room!'
The chop, calls Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the meaning!
"Show the security agents that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your places, they're gone!'
Thirdly: 'At night, come back here at ten and a half hours!'
And that's it, it's part of the beer party.
On the way, some new yellow caskets to the trees to find the way, the panels and even an electoral display of a large part of the Bavarois population.
We have to be ready for the return.
It is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the 'week-end of the Italians'.
There are no specific figures; it is said that 50,000 people are on their way through the Alps and are buried in the beer kitchen, 10 percent of visitors would have come from Italy this weekend.
The municipal police are reinforced by seven South Tyrol police officers, Italian volunteers supporting the Bavarosian Red Cross, which carry out statistics on the countries where Italians take the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
What is especially appreciated by Italians is the Hofbräu Brasserie.
Insomnia Nights for Hypo Real Estate shareholders
The German banking system was relatively stable, and the Federal Minister of Finance insisted that only a few weeks ago.
What a chance it would be for the politicians to use the word 'relatively' and that the German banking sector would not be separated by crisis movements.
It's actually over this weekend.
The real estate funder Hippo Real Estate (HRE), next to DAX, receives a fund from the German banking firm for a billion to protect from market disturbances.
A person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters Monday that the aid appropriations were delivered up to EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
Money comes from both private banks and public law banks.
In the background, it's the Defa girl company that supports the losses.
The state finance was, according to a newspaper article, refinanced very short-term for long-term projects for which it had borrowed money - which is no longer possible since the fact that it is not fair to the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, and the own capital rate had also decreased slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
The current and net benefits from financial transactions were, compared to the same period of the previous year, falling to zero, the benefits resulting from the allocation of determined credit and securities and the disposal of funds in credit operations were more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
And it is only thanks to the important benefits from the reimbursement of the low cost of accounting from the restructuring of the former Defa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for the companies of the Group that the deficit of approximately 16 per cent has been moderated.
After privatization in 1990, the former state financial system had at first miscellaneous industrial loans, which were then co-financed at the Aareal Bank.
Since the funding of classical state was not profitable enough, the Defa was then committed more intensively in infrastructure projects and in the financing of projects among private and State private investors (Privacy-Privacy, PPP) and internationally differentiated projects.
In terms of the value of the company, the Real Estate Hypo has to deal with amortisations that should have an essential material effect that remains at the same time a sufficient flow.
The fact is, the dividends were shot.
Already for 2007, they had been arrested at two thirds.
The Real Estate Hypo is a very important investor of state and infrastructure since the Defa strike.
It is stronger than other institutions that rely on refinancing on the interbank market because it has no customer deposit.
With the failure of the Lehman Brothers Investment Bank two weeks ago, the allocation of loans between banks was again considerably higher, the banks that have accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs an annual part - about 50 billion euros - of the entire Defa's credit for a short-term refinancing.
According to a statement from the Hypo Real Estate, the group's funding needs are covered by the medium-term credit and the company protected from the impact of international financial markets widely outside the current market.
Other sources say that the refinancing would be ensured through the funds by the end of 2009.
The Chairman of HRE Directorial Committee Georg Funke explained otherwise that the Hypo Real State Group should no longer be involved in financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Office for the Monitoring of Financial Services (Bafin) are starting from the principle that the capacity of the Hypo Real group on the market is now ensured.
The bank's shareholders and creditors are just waiting for it.
However, in view of the dynamics and impoverishableness of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is also not indispensable that it does not fail to make use of funding throughout its scope.
But the contrary can no longer be separated.
Following the fact that the bank, according to the latest communications, is still at the door of insolvency at the end of the evening, this rescue for the least temporary will not be possible to satisfy the spirits no longer.
The course of action rose from 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
The courses of obligations, however, are particularly good.
While debt to the first boss is being reduced to fines, the rates of the second plan loans fluctuate.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former Württemberg Hypo company and the well-known ones who have a lifetime beyond 2009.
The liabilities of the Hypo Real State bank seemed to be an alternative investment, but their value must now be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net collapse of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution that has caused the crisis in the establishment of the Depfa bank.
As the emission institutions, less affected governments and commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that arrangements can be withdrawn in time.
Or it will happen what no one can expect at this time - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed noises of partial nationalization, the likelihood of approaching luck today has become a simple basis for hope.
This should provide sleepless nights primarily for long-term creditors on the decision to know whether they should separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use what they have drawn up to constitute a report of losses for the next few years on the next tax on income from automatic cash gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the boat in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, aged 16, has to be present for the first day at the Tachibana High School, the girls start to smile: Germany is so "kawaii!"
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knew this word through the Mangas - in her new trade log, she speaks from Japan.
"The first day of the course in Japan.
That's what I was excited about.
I was already on my way to school. I was scared.
I live in Tokyo's pilgrimage to Kawasaki and take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I've got to find the way all alone, I'm glad I'm not lost.
The start of the courses does not seem to be as strict as that of us in Basse-Saxe.
The students appear after each other from eight hours, until nine o'clock at least twenty, a table tour begins with the teacher, the "human room".
But before the course started, I had to introduce myself.
I'm not of all sorts to talk to people, especially to a class of 40 students.
As I had not yet had the uniform at school, I put an old janitor from my mother's home, as well as a shirt, blue mount shoes and black leather shoes.
In this context, I was presented to the bishop, and I tried to say the right thing: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - I'm called Sylvana, I'm from Germany, and my birthday is in a week.
At the time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class did all the low-school shows, smiles and signs, and I heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him because of my hands.
It belongs to the vocabulary that is essential to the survival of Japanese ados and means "minignon, chou".
Then I'm quickly taken to my place.
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, she found that it was an honor that the appropriate should sit next to her.
The rest of the time was quite calm, but when the gong was removed, I was relieved in the rules.
Everyone talked to who was the best, who could laugh and ask many questions - in this case, it is quite difficult to understand English.
During the break, they all left their Bento.
My host mother had also done this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something more than German mercy.
I had rice for aromatic herbs, little sauces, a condom salad and algae, fruit and a kind of meat around Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat right here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What's sure is that everything's really good.
All right, except maybe the trusted jumps, brrrrrrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and is therefore particularly prepared - in the hope of making the boy know a little bit better during the break.
I read that in my pants.
I'm curious if I could see it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
Then I always answered:
"Because it makes me happy, what"
After all, reading about manganese is what I've been preferring for years.
And in order to understand better the manganese and culture that is, at one time, I also began to learn Japanese.
For me, it was quite clear that I had to travel one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, we give them a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the most recent technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is harsh, disciplined and traditional.
And as it is well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
The rats also have feelings
A rat or a horse was in danger, does that mean he's also feeling scared?
The neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
But how can we make sure that he tries the same thing when he behaves the same way we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for many years by prominent scientists.
SPiegel Online presents in a series of articles of answers to the question "What do you think you can be real without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other consciousness states without me or anyone else until now can prove it as much as we can't prove that other human beings have a conscience.
But in this case, we can at least expect all human brains to present the same configuration.
As long as we turn to other species and deal with matters of consciousness or in general conscience, we will be in difficultly practical lands because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: he makes death, was or was attacked.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists reduce a comparable subjective life.
However, I don't think so.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transition of our subjective life to that of difficult animals.
One of the aspects is that the circuits associated almost always with human consciousness include the Frontal Frontal Cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and in the management and execution functions).
This vast region is much more developed in human beings than in other primates and seems to be completely absent in other beings.
At least, therefore, for these aspects of our consciousness that depends on the pre-frontal cortex, including the consciousness of whom we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that human beings are even different from other primates.
Another significant particularity could exist in the language of the human being: a large part of his existence is related to language, which often means that his conscience is dependent on him.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness should not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal conscience, whatever the way it is produced, would be very different from most of our consciousness.
That's why it's also difficult to determine what conscience can be like in other animals.
If that, internal and subjective, is not to be measured or measured by the fact that this particular hardware is being analysed by based on our own experience, then its observation poses serious problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of consciousness, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientificly.
The awareness processes of animals could be examined without taking into account their content, and that is exactly what happened in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nerve correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the pre-frontal cortex's weight in the performance of the visualization.
But what is the result of emotion?
I conclude that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in a brain is aware of its own activity.
So what we refer to as "peur" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) falls within the living memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to the cortex regions that characterize primates and especially the Human.
Subtiles of feeling, associated with our vol volable nature, fail, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impose them on others than ourselves.
On the contrary, Antonio Damasio believes, for example, that feelings arising from primitive activities arise in the regions of Cortex's body sensation and the brain trunk, as well as Jaak Pankseep who focuses more on the brain.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could actually participate in all kinds of transversal feelings.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I can't contradict it, but I believe it is inconsistency.
Pankseep argues that what is like fear in men and in rats is probably as sensitive as it is in both cases: how can we still verify whether rats and men feel the same thing when they behave similarly?
A coward was in danger, but what if he feels scared?
In my view, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical vicuities.
Of course, nervous comparison helps: rats and men have similar brains, cafares do not even have a brain.
But is the brain trunk the source of feelings?
And even if we could prove this to the Human: how could we show it in the rats?
I think the rats and other mammals, maybe even the cafards (who knows?) have feelings.
But I wouldn't be able to prove it.
And since their feelings are probably completely different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behaviour than the emotional feelings of the rats.
In all cases, progress is being made on the nerve level as the same thing happens in rats and humans.
As I don't explore language and consciousness in rats, or feelings, I don't know if they exist.
It could be judged as a short term, but I prefer to go ahead rather than constantly getting to know me against a wall.
I'm actually a pragmatic emotional.
Platini, President of the UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The Government considers the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the European champions," Wasjunik announced.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun, and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the calendar of construction or destruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hotels run after the deadlines.
The number of courses for the European Championship could be reduced by eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at the maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis.
"The U.F.A. has been constantly looking at us."
A more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Football League PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The Commission met at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that PZPN will not be able to act in the rules," Drzewiecki of the Polish press agency PAP said.
"We made sure in an e-mail to the President of the UEFA that the preparations of the 2012 European Championship were not suffering."
Several members of the First Division League have already been sentenced in the previous season for the manipulation of compulsory relegation; in the end, the League has even been detached in the last minute.
Dennis Quaid Against Attack
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about her private life in an interview - and now she's embarrassed with her ex: the Hollywood star Meg Ryan raised the street on her ex-adult Dennis Quaid.
The Ecumen - and counter-attack.
A war of late Roses for ex-husbands Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, two Hollywood actors come to a horrible battle - face and face all over the world.
Last week, Meg Ryan expressed himself in an interview for the American InStyle newspaper on the causes of marital failure: "Dennis has been me for a long time unfaithful, and it was very painful."
She would've been aware of the extent of the fraud only after the divorce.
The reason for this strip of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - the story of an adult is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his unfaithful husband's qualifications is clear: this would be "Monstraeus", he said to New York Daily News, 54 years old, that "I will re-examine our relationship and manipulative history."
It would be more "recordible", which would be "the pain and the problems that make a divorce for each child to be relived in public" for their 16-year-old son, Jack."
While Ryan lives alone since the divorce, Quaid has recovered and will soon become his adoptive father.
So it was her answer to the flu: "In any case, my life continues.
I love having a wonderful family that goes better."
Air ticket prices and hotel prices fall
In the first half of 2008, hotel flights and nights were less expensive than last year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be even reduced to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would be beneficial - this is the result of a study by the provider of financial services and American Express travel.
The company analysed its reservation data in the first half of 2008 and established, after a price increase in the first quarter, a net down of profits in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market increased over the years, hotel nights have already been reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities still under review by 6.9 per cent on average compared with 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities under review.
From April to June, however, prices were 3.6 per cent lower than the previous year.
The trend was particularly clear in Paris and Rome, where passengers were to pay from 30 to 37 per cent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all of this would be for American Express in the low dollar course, which led to a "missing of American tourists".
Financial sites such as Frankfurt or London would also be affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanovre, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are rising by 26.3 percent, the record in Europe.
Also in the price of flights, the trend was to rise in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of kerosene, the economic class passengers paid an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-time flights, very fuel consumers, have even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, prices for tickets in economic class dropped by 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, in class and in first class, the price changes were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices were even more important than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had increased by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter, by 23.6 per cent.
German internal flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this drop in prices would be a flexible economic growth, explains the firm.
The application would fall from the ground in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure on competition from the "Open Sky" Treaty, which liberalises the air traffic between the United States and Europe.
A sign of the situation is the removal by airlines of non-permanent routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have deposited the balance during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies only in Europe.
One HSV Gladbach 1:0
With a simple purpose and method, the Hamburg SV becomes the first of the classification.
In Borusia, Luhuka has not always managed to find a functional eleven.
From Kristoffer Klein. Agrandir. Disaster attack for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player will only be in the game later, and his shot was hidden from the target frame.
His message was accurately formulated, it was from his lips in a persuasive manner.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," says Hermann Rieger in the shade of Hamburg's air clothing.
It wasn't a big thing in the clothes, the middle time was over and most were raced to their place.
Rieger has been the HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades, and he enjoys a great reputation as well as the former protagonists.
And that's why his application was received at strategic locations.
The assistant coach Cornelius Jol obtained and raised his voice to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the coach chief of Hamburg Martin Jol.
Which orders seem to have been similar: and what this means for this second purpose!
The application was missing.
"It wasn't very nice to see you today," said Marcel Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhard would have "sudacity also be more inhibited."
At 1:0 (1:0 in the mid-term), the Hamburg team had to hit the head by Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak Gladbach players could not harm Hamburg's weak players.
"It was a victory hall," said Marin Jol.
Hamburg's SV will celebrate this Monday for 121 years.
Already Saturday after noon, the supporters celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the screen, and the provisional classification tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first of the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to take back," said Marcell Jansen.
There is no doubt that the intermediate outcome of the table reflects more than the unpredictable character of the first League than the rule of its HSV.
The team with its late arrivals - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, Petric's goal guard as well as Jansen from the FC Bayern - is kind enough, but it does not shine yet.
"We need more charm and more drives," demanded Joel.
After the vote
At Wall Street, the fear of the circle.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan has temporarily cut down the Dow Jones 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day of history.
Later, the Dow Jones got a little bit stuck.
By 20h30, the world's largest bourgeoisie index was 10.579 points with a drop of 5 percent.
The Nasdaq technology exchange index was 1548 points with a drop of more than seven points.
The most lost of the Dow Jones was the American Express, which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could report any more benefits.
Bank Goldman Sachs' actions claimed a down of almost 10 percent.
A few days ago, the big investor Warren Buffet was associated with the company.
In the framework of the rescue plan, the means must be mobilized for the purchase of what is called broken hypothetical paper.
However, the sum must not be paid at once, but gradually.
On the other hand, the State should regain options on the actions of the financial company that could be re-examined in parallel to the evolution of the course in order to reduce the burden on the Public Treasury.
Courses of action in the tournament in Europe and the United States
Billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States are not due to investor concerns.
The course of the action of the large German bank Hippo Real Estate expands and takes the Dax to the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones index continues despite the saving of the financial market envisaged by the State.
The German index (Dax) has led to a deep deficit of the Hypo Real Estate and Commercial Bank.
In spite of the federal government's rescue operation and private banks, the Bavarois real estate fund has currently lost three quarters of its value, and the Commercialbank has charged more than 20 per cent.
The Dax was clearly below the important psychological barrier of 6,000 points and was 5,839 points with a 3.7 per cent deficit.
In the world, the market for action has fallen to the ground.
In New York, Wall Street would open with sensitive losses.
Investors were afraid that the US Government's $700 billion saving plan could not be sufficient to restore the financial markets.
The Dow Jones 10,809.25 points were lost in the first hour of opening 334 points or 3.3 per cent.
The House of Representatives of the United States intended to vote on the salvation plan, and the vote at the Senate should be held on 1 October.
Other European exchanges have also known only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 has been charged with a decrease of 3.2 per cent, the CAC 40 in Paris has lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the main Japanese index Nikkei fell to 11.743,61 points after an increase of 1.26 percent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index dropped from 2.1 per cent to 18.286.90 points.
In India, the main index of Sensex lost 506,43 points to 3.9 percent and closed to 12,595.75 points.
In the MDAX, Arcandor's actions fell after a capital increase was announced.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed 23 million new operations.
The multinational trade and tourism has further indicated that action will not be sold in Thomas Cook.
The shadow material influences the flight of space probes
Over the years, a mysterious phenomenon leaves researchers with perplexity: the matter of shadow influences the speed of space sounds during what is called gravitational support manuals.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has gone into space.
As soon as fuel drives are frozen, the death of the brain threatens.
Over the years, a mystery phenomenon has been a cause of development among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
The gravitational support is a manoeuvre of space probes, by which they obtain an additional element in the gravitational field of a heavenly body, the Earth, for example.
Thus, the sounds can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physics as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
This is what surprises researchers from other countries over the years: flying objects do not always behave as 100 percent of the way they are expected to be according to the verifiable laws of gravity.
Moreover, irregularities occur at the level of speed.
The probes become more unexpected or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They baptized him in the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that the theory of Albert Einstein's general relativity, which described the force of attraction of the matter of the fact of the space core, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study still believes that Einstein was not mistaken and tried to explain the anomaly of gravitational support through what is called the black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"The black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also near the Earth," he wrote.
Space researchers have only known the existence of black matter for about ten years.
It appears to be an attraction force whose effect is observed on other heavenly bodies.
On the contrary, it is completely invisible, that is, it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientific calculations, the black matter would also represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists taken to Egypt are free
Ten days after the hands of their rapists, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt should be released and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs confirmed.
Sudanese rapists had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the fusion prior to release, six hostages would have been killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were removed.
The negotiations for the ransom would be already under way.
The Germans are without a stop in the colimator of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE refers to the most important cases.
European tourists trapped in Sahara are apparently free.
This is what has been announced by concerts of Egypt's TV, Al-Arabia's Arab TV channel and Italian media.
Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian television channel booklet Sky TG 24: "Our concitizens and other hostages were released.
We're checking their health status," Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and Romanians as well as their eight Egyptian escorts are well and safe, the Egyptian national television announced.
The 19 participants in the wilderness should already be on the road to Cairo.
The circumstances around a fuse before the release of hostages remained afloat: thus, the kidnappers would have been nearing a deadline for the removal, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without calling the station.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," said the agent.
There was nothing left but gathering the otags, when the sodain, "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers had beaten this morning six of the rapists in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and two of them had been arrested.
The arresters had demanded from Germany a sum of six million euros; the money had to be paid by the German woman of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" said that, according to a German mediator, the release of hostages was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid for their safety.
According to the article, rapists wanted to release female hostages after payment of the ransom.
Men had to be held until the robbers had found a safe way to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this report.
Abuse of a beautiful father who's going to murder."
A court was informed that years of abuse imposed by her father had led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, from St. Stephens, in the Cornouilles, was imprisoned for six years after he had admitted eight charges for false facts.
The High Court of Truro mentioned that he regularly read his daughter, Stéphanie Randle, from 5 to 7 years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession letter: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court was informed that Melle Randle, aged 34, had been murdered at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
When she was a child in Conventry, Trerise had attached her to her before she was forced to commit sexual acts, while her mother was working in the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he will return to life in the Cornouilles.
His beautiful daughter's going to Plymouth.
However, the court was informed that Melle Randle, a volunteer of National Trust, had been subjected to abuse twice a week.
The Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told me that Melle Randle, who was a good survivor and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "he had lost all hope in life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terrence Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she was murdered by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faces the beautiful father of his daughter, who had also written a confession letter, which ends with: "I join the gang regularly".
"I didn't abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You're really weird as a fetish, your victim must have been a terrorist, especially at the age of 7.
"This exhilarating saga ended with the victim's suicide.
And what's even more surprising is that if she hadn't committed this act, her story would never have ended in court."
He added: "I stress in particular, as his father and mother describe it, the effects of your crime on Stéphanie for years.
"Without them, she would certainly be a happy, promising young woman today."
Impediment for loss of official data.
The Office of the Cabinet, which had forgotten the above-secret documents, in June on a train, will be condemned by the Office of Secrets Act, to the BBC.
The man from the Ministry of Defence was moving when he forgot two highly classified documents on a train headed by Waterloo.
The documents were passed in the hands of the BBC before being delivered to the police.
This is the most serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
The BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They would have thought that this case would remain between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of violating section 8.1 of the Act, i.e. the key to the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the Ministerial Officer be placed under the auspices of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Joint Committee on Secret Services.
The missing documents contained appreciation for Al-Qaeda as well as for the security forces ' resources in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision, Monday morning and was then taken from his home to a secret place.
Building companies face bill B & B.
The British construction companies could have to pay a bill of more than $80 million to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The Government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million brands from Bradford & Bingleys.
Interests in this loan will be paid by all companies that collect savings, including 59 companies in the building.
The Director General of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles stated that he is "excited" to know that the companies and their members should pay for the losses...
The £14 billion loan will be reimbursed when Bradford & Bingley's mortgages will be dropped.
But the interest that will increase at the same time will be charged, each year, to 700 financial companies that collect deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 companies of the building are included in this list.
It's scary to see that institutions that had a good attitude... now have to pay some of the bills of institutions that were much wiser.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is announced that each company has to pay a proportional sum to the deposits it holds, and that intermediate companies have to pay about 18 per cent of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest in the loan will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will need to find £81 million in order to address the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Commercial Committee of Construction Companies, told the BBC that this decision seemed unjust to him.
It's "irreprehensible" to see that institutions that have had a prudent behaviour during the recovery of the real estate market have now to pay for much wiser institutions.
According to BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first years.
"We must examine all aspects of this matter for the next few weeks, to assess the options to be taken to avoid the fact that construction companies and their members pay this paid bill," said Mr. Cole.
Interests for 2009 cover seven months, end September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will need to be paid for the entire year, which could also be doubled.
As construction companies are non- action organizations, their members end up paying the bill either by higher charges or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases up to five pennys per letter
Jersey's people have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that she would increase the price of her milk, five pennys per litre, from Monday.
This is the second increase in the price resulting from an increase in two pennies in February, followed by a research carried out by a consulting company.
Salesmen in detail must decide if they go to their tour, increase the price to consumers.
. Before the increase in February, the high price of Jersey milk had been varied for the last time in 2002.
An ex-Pm from Bangladesh has refused the bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected an appeal to the former PM Sheikh Hasina, who was thus at risk of being arrested on his return to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him his defence because of his trial for having beaten a man in case, 50 million Taka ($729,0000) when it was PM.
This case is one of the many charges against him.
Khaleda Zia, the Sheikh Hasina's constant rival, was released in prison earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina should return to Bangladesh a few weeks ago, but her part, the League of Awani, demanded that the provisional military government of the country first grant her full freedom.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of her release were contradictory because if she was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they did not see why she could not remain free from her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers announced that she would now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request saying that she did not need any protection because she had been allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will submit an appeal against the Supreme Court's order"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this protection to return to the country in order to prepare the elections in December
Sheikh Hasina should return after 17 October, said an old leader of the Awami party.
She was detained last year after the military interim government took over, but she was released in June to care for abroad.
Sheikh Hasina, like Zhaleda Zia, is not the charges they make.
Concerns about the Afghan antipolio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have lost the recent anti-polio immunization campaign, due to Taliban-related violence, said the United Nations.
The United Nations carried out a vaccination campaign last week in the six provinces.
However, it states that it is not possible to contact children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located in the south.
A United Nations spokesman stated that this has happened despite the Taliban's promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB lost the ITV judicial battle
BSkyB lost its process following the competition Commission's verdict, which would require it to reduce its participation in its ITV rival transmission.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares by 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that, in the past, the participation of MSkyB had prevented competition and had allowed it to influence ITV incorrectly.
BSkyB purchased its shares in 2006 following an agreement to prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Bureau reported that the purchase by BSkyB, of the ITV parties, had raised doubts about the effective independence of ITV, which therefore encouraged the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin's boss, Richard Branson, a group of consumers and the Offcom regulator were all opposed to this purchase.
BSkyB recalled that the force to reduce its VAT shares would not be reasonable and, on the contrary, it was excessive – especially since BSkyB had just relinquished its voting rights.
New investigation in the case of U.S. prosecutors.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to verify the issue of the license of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
All was born in the case of the Chief Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of certain ministerial officers.
The report was critical of the officers of the White House, the legislators and the former Attorney General, Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the subject of lawyers who claim that their licensing is due to political causes.
The Special Prosecutor, Nora Dannehy, will now investigate whether the officials questioned during the investigation lied to the investigators, thus imprisoning justice.
" Serious allegations of potentially criminal conduct, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor capable of forceing witnesses to deposit was one of his greatest recommendations.
The debate began with the release in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors by the Department of Justice.
At the time, the Department had stated that the prosecutors were licensed for medical benefits.
However, it would then arise that licensed prosecutors were no longer critical to their other colleagues, which would encourage some observers to assign a political connotation to these licences.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republicans of the Congress, while others would have refused to investigate false accusations against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and continuing judicial proceedings for the government.
It is certain that they can be licensed at any time, but they cannot be for political reasons.
The Chief of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, has been charged with being involved in this licensing case and has finally been released.
A number of ministerial officials in the Department of Justice have also given them their resignation.
The report of the Inspector-General was very critical to Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he would consider him "first responsible" of these licences, and ended with "abbicur" his lead role, "notably successful not being involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including former Bush collaborator Karl Rove, were criticized for failing to cooperate during the investigation.
The people of Meat Loaf will have to be honored.
The Rock star Meat Loaf, must be honored at Q Awards for his epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an oscar at the ceremony in London next week, declared to be "honored" to gain this recognition.
The nine-minute song was the title of the 1977 Meat Loaf album.
The award night is presented by Coldplay, with this year, with a limited selection of four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that cross things like time and kind, and Bat Out Of Hell is actually part of it.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a big voice like that of Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental section that takes almost two minutes.
The song was put on sale in the United Kingdom, as single in 1979, at the fifteenth place.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in English classes, and it was sold to over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, from his real name, has suffered health problems in recent years, even leading to an operation to cure his heart beat became irregular after he was exposed to scene in 2003.
In 2007, a strong Langigite forced him to cancel concerts.
Then we find him a kiss in the vocal cords.
A Rue Sombre in the City, Often Forgotten, and Can Be Welcome to Sale.
New York has hundreds of adventures, bulevards, street and other parallel routes, some famous, others only functional.
. And even some Veterans taxes as well as long-term local residents cannot give instructions to return to Extra Place because they have never heard of them.
The street is located in the East Village and is located in the north of First Street- not to confuse with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide for 120 long, it resembles a dusty alley rather than an active artery.
. No panels indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard Atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the newly built luxury furniture on First Street.
He would like to repair Extra Place, and create a more fluid passage to stores and shops, which should open in new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-term neighbors, have declared to be charmed by this resort simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets in the courtyard of houses.
But the Department of Conservation and Immobilier Development of the city that manages the street has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of neighbouring committees, representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay have issued a proposal allowing the real estate manufacturer to buy the street.
However, the Committee prefers that the street remain in the city's hands, and called for a new proposal to be submitted the next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No.3.
"There are only a few spaces in the city, and we would like the city to keep Extra Place," she said.
"They could suggest that he be released and managed, what other Avalon could do, but we want to keep him public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to repair the small street and install seats there, some would also be used by a coffee to which the manufacturer would grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, the port of Avalon Bay, said that while the company wants to operate the street, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to be the owner.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to relocate this abandoned drive, and make it public," she said, stressing that this was the city to suggest the sale."
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Immobilier Preservation, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, stressing further that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to his more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical impression.
Some believe that Extra Place bears this name since 1802, when the legacy of the great farm of many children by Philip Minthorne was divided, leaving behind this small drop of land, which remains after being abandoned.
The following entry of the CBGB, a stone rock monument closed in 2006, opened in Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to Ramones' cover album "Rocket to Russia"
"this place was wonderful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
She was full of ferries, haillons, barrels, posters, leaves and strings."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the evolution to the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rare feature - a virtually identical fragment in the city that should be placed in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subscribed "The Book of Contestations: A Look Ameregique Nostalgic on a City in the Extinction Process"), relates the history of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small black-and-white doll, shaded day and night, and delimited by the doors of a rolled iron warehouse and the hundreds of people, full of newspapers last week that are going along the gouts."
With few exceptions close, the street always has the same distance.
A short-acted rat at the bottom of the wheel, near a door that kept the CBGB locked, which is now the seat of a small dress store.
graffiti on the walls, a bottle of 22 empty onions, is on the side of newspapers that are just being thrown.
Some historians have stated that they do not think only of Extra Place, and suggested that it be valued.
Mr. Field, on his side, said that some undertook to consider the attraction of the street in his current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "have been carried out in dark, wet and boring places."
The Bilingual Debate: Emersion in English
In this part of the Education Supervision Programme, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, former member of studies in California, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not well that you don't think about it. Why middle classes must choose their school."
To attack the interests of Spanish voters is a complex business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Mr. Obama's campaign emphasizes that "American and Latin students are less likely to graduate than white students." It is a fact.
In order to combat these differences, Mr Obama's education programme supports in particular, among other subjects, "transitional bilingual education" for those who learn English.
The question for Obama, however, is whether his desire to achieve bilingual education that protects instruction in language classes other than English, will add to his interest in eradicating differences.
Take, for example, Six Street Prep, an elementary school in the east of the Los Angeles county.
Students in this school are mostly Spanish, and from low income.
More than a third of the students, composed of many new arrivals, study English.
Among CM1 students, 100 per cent have passed the 2008 State of Maths, expert level.
Similarly, nearly 93% of students have conducted an examination of English-language and art-languages.
This amazing success was achieved through another ingredient than that promoted by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street has established an ongoing capacity assessment and an exemplary attitude on analyses, practice.
In addition, and here's an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, head of the Sixth Street, this school introduced the instruction of the English language "full immersion".
The total English-language approach focused on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Melle Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, said, "We had a great success with a student who was coming from Mexico 12 months later, if you were to leave without his class, you wouldn't have been able to identify it."
"That's the way it goes, it's the way it's gone for us."
Mr. Obama should not take an example of the Six Street Prep and repeat it in other schools composed of most Spanish students learning English.
The excellent results of this school speak of themselves; but the policies on education within its part (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education, obscure the forecast of the response of Mr. Obama.
Although it is favourable to the fact that immigrants learn English, Mr Obama has recently considered this question insignificant, when he declares that we must all stop complaining about the bill in English.
"On the contrary, he said, "You must make sure your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should carefully consider the models of education that are working, rather than deduce them or consider them as insignificant.
Cute Net of Petrole followed by New Concerns of the World of Economy
Petroleum prices fell dramatically Monday, as people fear that the saving plan for financial markets will not be able to restore life to the economy.
The crude oil operations fell by 7 percent to $99.80 the barrel. New York Mercantile Exchange, at the sales of this morning.
Prices fell more than $20 in April last Monday.
In the past two weeks, the first material markets have been dried up by Wall Street's financial gain, as well as by two hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After it was announced in July, an increase of $145.29 in the barrel, prices fell to nearly $90 this month, before reimbursing in view of the deep uncertainties of the financial markets.
This Monday, investors are again concerned despite the rescue agreement, the largest of the history, concluded this weekend by Congress leaders.
The news has been raised by recent concerns that the crisis would be long-term.
In the last episode of this financial disaster," City Group will buy the Wachovia Corporation bank operations, the government announced this Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have in part nationalised the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
The analysts of Barclays Capital said that this weekend's sudden negotiations, concluded with the rescue agreement, seem to have failed to relive the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, should slow down.
"the prospect of global equity, interest rate and market exchange has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank's analysts wrote in a letter to their investors."
"we believe that the first materials will not escape this contamination.
"As far as the first material is concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand where the American virus would spread globally and particularly in China."
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for the next year, given the drop in oil consumption due to slowing economic growth, so they were obliged to reduce 20 percent, oil and gas prices forecast for 2009.
The Second Determining Time Festival for the Improvement of Team Record.
After spending the last eight months, more time than anyone in the uniform of the Shaun Ellis Jets, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He looked at the second time, when the Jets transformed a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like this," said Ellis.
The second time began after Jets and Arizona Cardinals also played under cloud clouds.
Then the fourth back Brett Favre managed to take a walk in Laveranues Coles allowing a 12-yard touchdown, signaling a pre-signor of a post-midi during which their relationship made a bond in advance.
Favre found Cole for two more touchdowns, the first time a corner back fell and the second, at 10 seconds of the middle time.
"I'm not out of my area" Fabre declared all his steps to Cole.
"it's a mediocre player."
"We communicate very well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Cole were playing the cat, the defense fought the fourth back of Cardinals, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards up to touchdown.
Eric Smith took another step and intercepted him.
Linebacker, David Bowens lets himself escape the balloon because of Warner.
The last change, the loss of Bowens balloon, could well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this property for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the balloon, Jay Feely made a 20 yard goal with an advantage from 34 to 0.
That was the best Jets could've had in a while.
"The Jets train, Eric Mangini, to whom we were asked to describe this leaflet, said "the second time or the third time?"
When he was told, the two Jets left 21 points undisputable in the third time, Mangini said, "I can tell you that I appreciated the second time more than the third time.
"Many points have been marked in a short time."
Gbrssellassie restated, over his world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopian, has again proved worthy of being the best runner of the century, after having beat his own record of the world to Berlin's marathon on Sunday, thus becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a 2 :03 :59 victory of a relaxing course on the beach, Gebrsellassie beat his record of 2 :04:26 last year in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his great career, during which he won the world champion or world record for any distance of 1600 metres from the marathon.
The last month, Gebrselassie had lost Beijing's Olympic Marathon, fearing that today's eyes might be exaggerated, - that air pollution does not increase its asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promises to run to Berlin.
Under almost perfect-time isolation conditions, 48 degrees at the start, 55 at the arrival-Gebrselassia has gained Sunday, now an impressive average of one thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
The track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, turned into deep runners, have contributed to the decrease in the marathon record for more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa wins in Berlin at 2:06:05 .
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselasie told the reporters that he had suffered seizures at the mill two weeks ago, and that he had been out of training for a week.
Clearly, his rest allowed him to remain bright, but not redened.
"I'm so happy," he told the reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I was sent back last week, and today I have doubts; but in the end, everything has gone for the best."
In Kenya, especially, the rival is African from Ethiopia, to have too much orchestrate his courses, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, counting on books as if they were in a track competition, and considering world records more than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not reduce the size of Gebrselassie's capabilities as a core runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. in my way.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrsellasie after the file heads disappeared.
After a little more than three miles of arrival, Gebrselassia made its final remount to detach from Kwambai, which ends at 2:05:36, improving its best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis arrived the third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year with the seventh time of 2:19:19.
The English Paula Radcliffe has the world record at 2:15:25.
The last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko, surprised everyone who won London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She can't participate in Beijing games because of a bad double hypothesis, but she promises to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record for almost five minutes.
It runs through a well-known strategy, allowing the group of Ethiopian runners and canyans to take a good advantage, then more than 18 miles 1⁄2 after.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia arrived second at 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyan, finished third at 2:25:01.
In a City of Part, the Orgueil and the Trials of the Black Road
Hidden in the development of its vast park, a few miles away from the island, the brilliant and the giant Orlando, there is a quiet little town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first completely black city to integrate, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make of our days." The city is in five lakes, three shorts of croquet, 300 skin covered, 300 good nags, full of goyaves, two schools and no prison."
She has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival each year in Eatonville to honor Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city described has become a tourist by its inclusion in Florida's tourist guide edited by The Depression- era Federal Writers' Project- remains a separate place.
She is also independent, honorable, and private that she was not already in the 30s, when Hurston reported that the black rural population of Florida was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who "we know so little, doesn't know what he's missing."
Even though it is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also called for an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain cautious of the view of foreigners.
"we are very careful about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, who has always lived in Paris and the oldest Parisian city.
"it needs to be consistent with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and battle.
It is both a historical model of black power and a community of nearly 2400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a central point, but also an example of a black South-South rural culture - sometimes detached, sometimes accladed - that reminds the birth of American slavery.
What would explain why the residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville was born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
It presents its birth city throughout the world through sincere books, full of dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes We Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed this city, located just at the exit of Route 17, a road that goes through the center of Florida, often forgotten, which is covered in the chapter of the black history and the human drama.
Audacity such as a large box in life as in literature, Hurston led the readers to the property store of the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parts.
"passed the road on the left," she wrote, "you will find the modern public school marron and white, with its gardens and these well preserved games areas where Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells all kinds of drinks as well as all that can be used for people passing through.
So, in spite of hundreds of words, Hurston associated Eatonville with a car government but also with analphabetization, rehabilitation, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't like that.
It wasn't actually a portrait that everyone appreciated.
Zora described the reality "did Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's young daughters who died, citing the colourless songs, interpreted by men who praised their beauty."
She adds: "Some people have not appreciated it."
We always remember Hurston as a living and eccentric person, who often returned after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, recalls that Hurston came from a town without warning, along with a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing pants here, even today, is proud of traditional customs.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told me, while many were laughing at her.
"the people were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he added, balanceing himself in his chair of the post-patio that he gave on Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she had never stayed too long."
At the death of Hurston in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was hit by a star of literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman in the Barnard College of the 20s, she was buried in a grave somewhere in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no big memory, no record for the big audience.
I don't think they included the contribution or inheritance it offers to the world " said Valérie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a Houston biography published in 2003.
A crucial moment takes place in the 1980s.
Public officials from Orange County wanted to take a road to five streets in town to replace Boulevard Kennedy, the main street on two roads in the community.
The development of Orlando has already moved Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville just gave up a difficult period of history.
Strong integration, among other things, has led to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the debate on the mix of races has led to hatred at the gates of the community.
"At that time, a band of white young people had come to launch oranges or objects against people sitting on the side," said Franklin.
"a lady is even dead."
They run a pasta from their car."
In a 1955 letter addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for a forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education" an insult rather than the glorification of my race."
Residents now declare that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has weakened Eatonville's cohesion and has weakened the confidence of young people.
"The black children had the habit of being pregnant - I remember it well - our master would wake up in the morning, and in the evening too," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, and director of the Eatonville Community Security Guard, a non-profit group.
This lasted until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You wouldn't wear your white teacher because he's white - I mean there's a cultural demarcation line," Melle Nathiri said.
Civil rights, on the other hand, have created space for other black writers Zora Neale Hurston -- actors and artists who have gone beyond the injury, such as her, armed with a happy confidence and conduct lines such as: "How can they be deprived of the pleasure of my company?"
It's over me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went back to the anonymous tomb of Hurston and began to fight for her reputation.
Five years later, an abbreviated biography on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, re-entered the American cannons.
The highway project arrived just when Eatonville's most famous daughter had found her attraction.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors considered her a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to show the catastrophic consequences of this road.
Hundreds of boys came to the opening of the festival two years later, and many come back in January to celebrate it.
After many years, the county rejected the proposal of the highway.
"The car taxi on five roads, extremely fast, a real civil pride," said Melle. Nathiri.
Melle Boyd sums up the statement "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the autoroute project enabled him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been frequenting our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been a historic city since 1998.
A mono-theme library (also known as Hurston) opened in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, reopened.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: at six miles from Orlando, it can at any time be regarded as a rear road on a summer rain day, as small as when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today accounts for 90 per cent of blacks)
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, their reason for being, are still treated with caution.
It is necessary to request permission for most interviews, and some things - such as the walls of the old Eatonville church, painted by the white man, depicting black men in the camps - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Melle Jones, a courageous teacher who has a weakness for the living red, are always afraid that their island community is not well understood.
However, in view of the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain local pride level is rising.
Young people in particular tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston's whole race: beautiful, problem and everything, not better or worse, but also proud, creative, bossive, popular and mixed than other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is good for civil affection to be heard in the voice of the 18-year-old nephew of Mr Franklin, Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or the police forces, who need additional strength.
And even for the younger ones, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon of the 11th year of Winter Park, they seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
"Most of the people who go into this area will think, "Oh, this city has nothing compared to others." Alondra Kenon said after the last Sunday.
But if you stop and take time to track the story, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, everyone's talking financially.
In spite of everything, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the kitchen and the green TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think that in the wine and snow offices above their head, the bankers and fund managers who monopolize New York, have been spending the worst "working day at the office" since the 1929 crack.
The bookstores continue to stand on the trottoirs, with their carrots and muffin plates for their daily meetings.
The Latinos are always trained among the residential buildings, carrying, like women, a hundred luxurious shirts attached to a jig on their shoulders.
Office employees continue to make the queue to buy their morning sandwich to the ambulances, and it is always impossible to find a taxi between 16 and 19h per week.
I didn't feel the crisis despite the completely pessimistic reports until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I was planning to work late afternoon, as I found out at my local JP Morgan Chase office, a dozen people who were doing the cooking.
Not in front of the cashier's tickets, nor in order to remove the species or make a payment, but in front of the customer's service ticket, where regular customers ordered their tickets, tourists asked for guidance for the Macy store, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I'd learn from Starr, my authorized personal banker, all of them were making the same cause as me.
Not in the same way, because they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, such as those of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from the accounts of so-called truffles (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings caches and their branches that operate only in a state, who say to treat customers as their family.
In the past, 15 of these banks have failed.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank in the capital of $327, made use of the bankruptcy union, and while New Yorkers went home for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, to savings accounts of $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to save.
The office and the store staff who are in front of me, disappointed by another potential drawback, transferred their money to a bank that they seem reliable, or the one who makes the most of the rescue in Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the financial world in recent weeks.
"I heard a lady at my Chinese local supermarket talking on the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bank that failed, and her major director General Dick Full, with the same familiarity she could have to criticize a colleague.
And Lynn, the concierge in the uniform form of my furniture, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my fruit and vegetables.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "I put all my savings in the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take risks."
Muslim tombs buried while Austria oscillates to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who left the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and , Filip Dewinter from the right Belgian Vlaams Belang, participates in a demonstration to present the "Chiefs Against Islam" in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They carry road panels depicting red-ray masks.
The Police accuses extremists of having won an Austrian Muslim summit, the weekend of the victory of the political parties of extreme rights to the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at Traun's cemetery, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning, according to the police, of an organized action.
Criminals have painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; detectives believe that this could have been done to dispel the feeling of hatred of extremists against Muslim immigrants.
This accident could be in some way related to the elections.
A voice from the Islamic local community declared to be "prolongedly shocked" at the announcement of this profanation, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan, which affects its end.
Austria seriously thinks of finding her courage, following her oscillation to the right in parliamentary elections yesterday.
The two sides of the right-wing party, which highlighted almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, have carried out an anti-immigrant campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, as xenophobes.
Heinz-Christian Strache, head of the Freedom Party, who won more than 18 percent of the votes, took his campaign against the port of the follard and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to the alaha food.
During his final course in Vienna, he spoke of "a European fraternity" to avoid the mountains of Islam.
The two parties tried to prevent the construction of museums and mines, claiming that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamicization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out just after the elections have defined the extreme right as the strongest political block in the country, which is shown by the majority of young voters who have made the difference because they are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter was forbidden to travel abroad.
The courts prohibited the rock star glamour, Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, exploitation in France and Spain.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after expressing his intention to return to Spain through France.
The Kent Police had granted this ban to travel last Thursday after proving Glitter's guilt for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing of Ashford's limited court, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said "on Thursday 25 September at Ashford's court, Kent's police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd wasn't here then."
Glitter, 64 years old, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, not to be listed in the lists of sexual abuses.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police seven days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he may be punished for up to five years of imprisonment.
Kent's police said that it would not discuss particular cases or potential Glitter movements in the county.
"Kent's police will do whatever it takes to protect our children as aliens.
"in our opinion, it is easier to monitor someone who lives in the United Kingdom because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, in a much more effective way.
"protecting Kent's residents is the most expensive intention of the Kent Police, and we will closely monitor the conduct of those who are accused of sexual abuse in the region, in order to minimize the potential risks for the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after having spent 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls, respectively, aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he had to sail for a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him in passport control, and finally he leaves Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities denied him entry into their territory and therefore had to leave Bangkok; the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 of Heathrow Airport on August 22, and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the limited court of Uxbridge, West London, for him to be registered in the list of persons charged with sexual abuse, as requested by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had been sentenced to four months in the United Kingdom for child abuse.
One source of the Ministry of the Interior stated that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was satisfied and happy to know that Glitter had been banned from moving to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master outside the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photograph
We're not naked, we're not wearing extra clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, free of all tensions to obtain the perceived aspect of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in the privacy, at these times unknown to the general public, where we discover hidden gestures and glances from artists who are not interested in mounting on stage.
German Günther Bauer blends in "Flamenco - people" the theatre of some scenes with singers, dancers and guitarists with this least known side of artists.
In this project, the photographer repeats the special iconography of flamenco under different English.
Even in the programming of the month of the Flamande Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who explains that "Flamenco - people" "may be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that this is not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of passing on stage of passion, sadness, joy ... arresting the public.
To capture the moments of the personality of these artists, there is no need to take photos on stage.
They have a personality and a pure character.
What was interesting to me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera photos of the character moments of the stars of the flamenco."
With the festival "The Popular Chant of Mines", Bauer started a long trip to photograph the singers, guitarists or dancers with a camera camera in 1997.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of photo and material, remember classical photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and stands out every day".
It is not about the dance or song itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captures the audience with his art.
The search for essentials and magic was the constant work that these days are presented at the El Fotomata gallery.
Flamenco views such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about sixty-ten photographers.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a collection book of portraits exposed to the gallery.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Old Sports Portraits" ("SportARTProject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph the portrait of people, to know them and to be able to enter into their lives for a longer time or less.
I think in photography the portrait is the most difficult kind.
You're facing people, people you don't know or who just leave you a few minutes to make a photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people", is presented at the El Fotomata Gallery, located at the 20th Street of the Mata (pair parallel to the People's Republic of Hercule) which will be opened until 16 October next.
Vargas Llosa admits that the novel he wrote is "true audacity"
The novel is held in places where no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once more, Mario Vargas Llosa is very determined to advance the new project on which he works, a novel that has a leading character Roger Casmant, an Irish nationalist who has lived in Congo for twenty years and has been through the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize in Literature admitted yesterday at Hay Festival Segovia that the novel that currently deals with it "is a true virtue" and that "all prove that it should not be written".
"If I were reasonable, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the exchange of ideas and thoughts that he had seen in the city of Aqueduct for four days to see hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most expected person of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the award of the Hay Festival to the majority of the voices of the participants, made a meeting with the theatre Juan Bravo.
The representative of the Festival, Félix Romeo, came face-to-face with a fascinate audience who had not seen the past time during which Peru, with a prodigious memory and a great dose of humor, delayed the birth of its literary vocation, which is due to "a dream to read" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote of a "very methodical way" thanks to an intense work of documentation, correcting and rewriting part of the text to face his "inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas influenced his speech and how his memories inspire his novels.
The Hispano-American novelist recognized that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change lives. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure taste, ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "is looking for the least-like people", because it was asked the writers "do not let go to frivolity" and take their vocation.
The worst time to catch Pozoblanco's fire
The flagship party that ended the Pozoblanco fire tower race was suspended yesterday, after the horse-riders had verified that the air was improbable.
In this way, the organizational committee, in accordance with Fermín Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the tour course.
The worst time was spent on this fair, because at last two parties on three could not have been held.
Saturday is the rain that prevented the celebration of the second stage of planned drums.
On the show, there was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who had to face in the castle of Castilblanco.
So only Friday's party took place
Friday, the winner was Daniel Luce who cut three ears and was brought to triumph, after having made hand movements to the tower with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the bottom of the tower and a cut ear that the discovered stairs praised more than his fight himself with the tower.
More for El Juli, who entered the streets of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his fight with the second tower, after a much better fight, he became famous by most of the public.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilograms of hachisch found
At least five o'clock in the morning.
Control of the movement of the police of Euskadi (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Commune d'Armiñón (Alava).
Police officers stop two officers from a van and these two are running away.
Their charge, more than two tons of hamish, is to stop them.
The police continued and arrested one of the two employees, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A.J., according to information published by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual was accused of drug trafficking and falsification of documents.
The incident took place when various officers of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out vehicle control on the N-1 at the border of the Armión Community.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, crashed, and began control.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two miles further on the low-cost, where the two employees were down to escape in a wooded area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two employees and took the 2,178 kilograms of hachisch they transported and found after inspecting the supply chain, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hachisch ballots. Afterward, they moved to a police post for extensive inspection and to weigh the drug.
In addition, the officials found that the registration plate had been "false" since it did not match that letter on the grey paper of the supplier, that is why they also charged the prisoner with a falsification of documents.
Ertzaintza continues its investigation to stop the other suspect, who has managed to recover and determine the source of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old prisoner, A. A. J., was taken into custody to complete the different stages and will be judged within the following hours.
Actress Heather Locklaar is arrested for driving under the influence of a medicine
The actress Heather Locklaar, the famous Amanda of the Melrose Place TV series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of a medicine.
A witness saw him perform foreign maneuvers trying to get out of his garage in Montecito, after a spokesman from the California police patrol opened up to the People magazine.
The witness explained that at 6:30 p.m., Locklear "supported the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get out of the garage car, and going back several times, she rolled on her sunglasses."
Not long after, the witness, who at first did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stopped in the middle of the car and left his vehicle.
This person, right now, called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"It had a deorientated air," which is why the agents led it to the drug and alcohol centre to carry out a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress showed cooperativeness and alcohol abuse has been separated since the beginning, although "according to the observation of police officers at first sight, we think Locklear was under the influence of a medicine".
Locklear was arrested suspected of being driving under the influence of a substance that was not specified and was imprisoned at 19 a.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was out of Arizona's clinic where she was in to take care of a nervous depression.
Callers asked the Union Left's Andalustic Federation to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The General Coordinator and Member of the Union, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to take a decision on the case of the former counsellor of the Youth and Sports of the City of Séville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who was released last week after being accused of having been accused of having been treated in favour of members of his family.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and this will be the Andalian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said regarding the political party's behaviour that he will have to adopt within the Séville municipal council.
However, the Head of the Union Left asked that the investigations prove "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The Union Left has always defended this kind of business so they have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party had "very strict ethical codes for all officials".
"Sangre de Mayo", Garci's osé
In inspiration of the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci celebrated the famous Spanish battle against the French in "Sangre de Mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his film with almost 15 million euros of budget.
The film tried to "scan the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous Romance, he explained today during the film presentation, with Kim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film of more than two and a half hours, "Sangre de Mayo" will make its appearance in the next Friday cinema halls, which will then become a television series for Telemedrid for more than four hours.
The great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci, ensures that he has made with this tournament "a dream of a child" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who, three years ago, turned a memorial film for the two hundred years of May 2, which he always accepted when the story took place in the national historical facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Madrid Community constitute a "only opportunity" for Garci to reproduce the environment of "a Spanish who was deceived by the struggle for independence, because the struggle for independence led the people to rebel under the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said.
But the cinematist regrets that he had not received funding as for the films "Captain Alatriste" or "Goya's ghosts" - more than twice as much as "Mayo Blood" - because he could not turn some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, who worked with him during almost all his career.
The "Restart" movie has influenced its usual way of working, on the stage of actors, with whom it has the habit of repeating before the turn and to whom it does not throw, because it seems to him "humbled" and considers that "the role of cinema is to go to theater and cinema to keep himself informed".
Many actors in "Mayo Sangre" repeat themselves in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Gillén Cuervo.
Four times a candidate to Oscar (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidates who represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Sangre de Mayo", "Seven French billboards" and finally the winner, "The blind tournaments", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which should be better known," he said.
With this film Garci doesn't expect a price.
"At first you believe that you work for the posterity, then you realize that your work is only for the prosperity, and now you're happy to do more film," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón is put in the skin of the seville dancer Tortola Valencia
A sevilllian dancer will give tribute to a sevilllian dancer as well.
Carmen Törtola Valencia, the daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Törtola Ferrer) and an Andalous Mother (Georrina Valencia Valencia Valencia), was born in the Triana neighborhood and who, at the age of three, was going to live in London with his family.
It was a dance of free and professional dances of Oriental dances.
She was a passionist, pioneer of the release of the woman, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and pleda for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of the dance in Europe of the two-year-olds has fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, and this last one offered me to interpret the sevilllian dance of Tortola Valencia and that seemed incredible to me."
According to the dance, "we do not try to tell his life but to translate his way of thinking.
His dance titles made me think of flamenco.
Thus, "the dance of the papillo" made me think of a popular Cuban dance and "the dance of the snake" to some tangos.
His dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was identical to the stage," she said.
The scene was made with two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabela again in one of his shows, as he had done at "The Open Door", and that of Professor Matilda Coral, who was extremely interested in working with the student.
"Matilde transforms Tortola into a mature person.
I am happy that she has agreed to play a role in my work and that I am honored."
The scene was also staged by the musical composition and the guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Ariaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the persecutions of El Pájaro, and the violence of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were considered to be divines".
This work also relates, in some ways, the life of this woman who has been living in places as far away, especially for the time being, such as India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, as she normally lived in London.
"I wanted to remember it because I think these are women who have a tremendous influence in their time and now no one knows and appreciates their work," said Bayón.
The show will begin at 20 a.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre
The publication of "Journal of a recently married poem" concludes on Wednesday
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a recently married poem" in the church of Saint Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalousie to celebrate the "Treennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón " (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and their deaths.
Thus, the "Treennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón " comes to its end with the re-examination of this work, the International Congress that took place in New York, the restoration of the Nobel Museum, and the tourist exhibition " Juan Ramón Jiménez: This light people" which was opened in May and who, after travelling in the different Andalu provinces, went to New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalousie purchased eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a recently married poet", edited by Pedro Tabernerro and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Encisso, to continue the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America Prays Less Without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was a party."
This phrase is from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in the "Absence of Malice," and well illustrates the despair of American cinema, and of all America, in front of the amazing idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
I've been hard to get an Oscar
He hasn't been back since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard time for everyone.
"Sometimes a feeling goes beyond all expression, and now I have lost a big friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were the best thanks to his existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
One of the fathers of cinema and patriots died during a particularly dark period, where terrorists and bourgeois markets are alarmed, the US's appreciation is low, desperate for reasons of dignity.
When times are so hard and there is no reason to live, it remains to be human beings but admire and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It was an ideal of beauty and truth for everyone.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and vaccinated causes, such as the foundation for the anti-drug fight created in the honour of his uncle who died after a overdose and the creation of his own bio-food brand.
It was a victory for a country who had the pressure to fight a suicide food culture.
This huge wave of admiration was called Hollywood without paying attention to nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another English poet, Sam Mendes, said working with Newman marked the summit of his career.
The bad guy from Australia, Russell Crowe, was able to call Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He put us in the high bar," said George Clooney, who may be the only one today who is trying to track the screen as Paul Newman did: by being very honest and having a serious private life and far from goals.
This is not always easy or possible in the media jungle of our day.
But there is someone who is trying, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who was faithful even though his opportunities did not miss him to be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger outside my house, if I have a biffet in my refrigerator?" he had the habit of enjoying it.
In heaven, he is proud to meet his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles that he has played, he has never been as proud as the devoted husband, loving father, caring father and philanthrope," he says.
Madrid at the 2016 Olympics event
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize Olympic Games, after the fall in 2012, that could happen in 2016.
But you're asking me if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's course: we're not!
They call it the perfect course, but I think it was the best course I've ever attended.
If they had taken into account all the errors made during the course, they would have been the subject of an all-emergency note.
But let's look at everything in detail and from the beginning.
Errors start with withdrawal of dosards, which requires you to move forward.
That's not bad, but if they move you, it would be better for them to give you everything (including the electronic tip for the courses).
And it's not.
They only made you go down there to take the dosard (first mistake, move only for it) and (after a long wait) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the maillet (second error, because I need an XL size)
In what world are we living?
Is it because of the crisis that they have decided to buy only small-scale e-mails with less fabric and less expensive cuts?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that you need to go there very quickly to remove the electronic beam, the wait file is 15 minutes and, moreover, you need to leave your bag at two at the entrance.
The waiting lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible as 11,000 people are expected for these courses.
Since there was a long waiting file, the competitions started and we had not yet left our bag twice to the entrance, although once in fact, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the waiting for more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and massacres took place.
I think about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me will not even be in the classification with the right time, because of the noise they gave me who, I think, did not correctly mark the departure.
Of course, if they asked me to quote an example of a perfect course, that would not come to my mind.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the J.O. 2016.
Microsoft searches for a receptionist (virtual)
At the Microsoft MIT Emergency Technologies Conference, a new system of human image recognition and interaction was presented, a species of Artificial Intelligence has little intelligence but is able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in Microsoft case, a ship to move into the company's field) in response to what was asked of it during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a face recognition system, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, which they are - including remembering what jobs they are dealing with - and listening and listening to the key words of their conversations.
But also group them by conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person, but she realizes that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asked him if she was here to visit someone and she told him she'd answer him in a few moments.
All of this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course that represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we discussed more than a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be easier and it will no longer have any programs associated with it.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were sold with the unusable instead of useless applications, they would be five times faster.
This is a discovery because Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding functions and extras to Windows.
The change of the strategy is welcome.
Microsoft's reason, its operating system has lost its importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that Google Chrome is the first turn of Google to compete with Windows.
A number of people have pointed out that an Internet browser is not a operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary as it is the necessary basis for the information material and software to be understood.
It's the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's true.
He will never disappear, but he must see the "death" of the operating system, not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
That week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system but more to the Internet browser.
The computer is turned only to turn Firefox, Explore or Chrome and people spend more time each day browsing the Internet than crossing windows.
Who serves half of the applications provided with the system?
The least one can do.
And Windows 7 should contain less applications, much less Vista.
Less heavy, less comfortable, less complex.
For the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they can finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need that, in fact, and I show you an example.
The photo presented in this article was taken early this month in one of the spare rooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the wine distributor, a display shows them asking to use their own research tool - "Your research. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not appear at the beginning of 2009 but until the end of 2009 or see 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, looks more like a computer.
But the launch of Android is delayed and iPhone is already on the market, which will cost them money.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso brought him to the Azur County, Leonardo di Caprio, and brought him one into Edward Zwick ' s Blood Diamond, as well as Al Pacino in the 'The Parrain ' of Francis Ford Coppola, and became part of the association of the muscles.
And if we were to enumerate all its appearances, we could also mention this muustachu suit that raised weights in an ambulance circuit.
It's not just a mere human body meal in cotton, mouling and with no stains.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel de Bruxelles distinguishes from all others.
First of all, by his flamboyant name - although known under the name of Marcel ' - he has to see the sport as he takes the name, according to legend, of the poet Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
' Marcel ' distinguishes others by his excellent cotton, by his unisex cut, by his distinctive logo, and by the small Belgian cloth (recognisable punished) that the most well-known corpses have in the neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not produce only tanks tops.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxings, cassette cards, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Habits designed for the comfort of clothes.
Even if it's harmful to wear them just like clothes.
They've got too much charm.
"I want to become a young mother; the candidate doesn't bother me"
His enormous comparison with his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, sisters Cruz take very seriously their new activity in fashion.
According to Monica, they are only beautiful and famous girls who give their names.
It was presented to the promotion of Mango brand in Paris at its new social headquarters but also to the presentation of the most important prices in the way the Spanish home sponsors.
Monica's hot and scared.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to introduce the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have even created for Mango for the new summer season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of Mango Fashion Awards and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
A very intense day, but, at the same time, exciting, awaits us.
On what basis is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The 50s and 60s film fills us and inspires us very much for our collections.
I love to dance in town and watch women see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do so often.
Dance, actress and designer, you're a very popular woman, aren't you?
I think it is, but in the end, everything is getting together and these activities have a lot of things in common.
Since I was very young, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my mother's house to look at my aunt's wardrobes and to see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the attraction park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my way of getting dressed.
Dancers love to dress well for courses and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you wear clothes is at this moment that you really put yourself in the person's skin.
At least it's all connected.
You haven't been 30 years, has that been hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30 years are happy.
I find that the woman is more mature, more experienced and more able to enjoy life with less problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done everything I've ever wanted to do since I was little, and that has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So you think you're going to be mom?
Of course, I want to become a mother because my body is asking me to, and I also want to be a young mother; I don't want to lose that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I don't care.
What I would do is give my son a lot of pleasure and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movie, you expect the different movies you've turned last year to come out.
It's true, I hate them to leave.
I'm a woman out of the theater, I'm very patient and worried, I'd like to have everything now, but of course that's not possible.
I've had a lot of stories about the films 'The Last Time' and 'A Search for the tomb of Christ'.
To see what you're thinking...
A few days ago you started on the walker with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I'm not up on the stairs to make the mangoin.
Simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I know her from time to time, to invite me to participate in London to a charity benefit for her association in favour of the support of women and the clothing we show - I showed two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold to collect money for Naomi's NGO.
The people Naomi is a person in the heart of the tent.
They say so many things about her, I know it, many things are not true.
Moreover, what's so good about Naomi makes me look good.
She asked me to stand up for a cause so noble, but if she asked me to be poor, I would have done it at any time.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Alcohol recidists on the flight will have to install the 'alcolock' system.
The Minister of the Interior wants that the driver who has had more than three administrative sanctions for alcohol should install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from running in the state of circulation, or if he does not breathe.
The initiative was already announced in the last month of June and now appears in the State Minister's report in which this initiative is considered to be a pilot project that will last for a year.
Its purpose is to re-enter the driver by proposing road retraining courses.
The Ministry of State responsible for road safety but also the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Institute of Technology for the Safety of Vehicles will participate in this initiative.
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of the car drivers arrested for driving more than once in the state of emergency are in the car.
This would be avoided because it is a vehicle-based system that measures the level of alcohol in the hall and prevents the vehicle from being started if the driver does not suffer before; or when the driver's alcohol rate is higher than the authorised one.
Its cost is above EUR 1,000 and is in charge of the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in 2007 in the United States showed that vehicles equipped with this device would reduce to 65 per cent of the offences during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save life to 115 people every year.
This measure takes into account only administrative sanctions for two reasons: face these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And facilitating its implementation, as legal reform may be done by ordinary means, but reform by criminal means requires reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have an experimental name.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote in favour of the Spanish Socialist Party, which proposes to install this system in schools as did in France.
In Mexico no 'peep-toes'
At 7:40 p.m., the planned official hour, the plane of the Spanish Air Force in which the Asturias princesses traveled to the Presidential Hungary of the airport Benito Juárez of Mexico DF.
The sun was watching to fall, but its rays were still forced to put their hands in a mirror so that they could see the royal couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours ago, I asked in the street, at the taxi driver, if it was the time the Spanish princess visited the city to finish their official trip.
- Ah, very well, we can't go to the airport to take customers at this hour... are you here or...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I've lived here for two years thinking.
- Oh, very well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who are the Princesses of Asturias and knows the importance of travel.
They are several waiting in the airport hangar near the red tapes and a military range composed of 27 marine soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in sea blue, the Princess, when she, with her hair in the wind, is dressed too much and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a prayer was dangerous.
They make a brief stop with photographers before passing into the room where the official cortége awaits them.
At the hotel door where they live, one of the four biggest hotels in the city, a regular Mexican television journalist awaits them.
The highest price of the mode
There must be no more suitable place in the world to present a price of fashion than Paris and there must be no designer living more extraordinary and good than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded with a price of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her models in Mango wine at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she was almost excited.
Of course, it is the second largest brand store in Europe that has just been opened with 1.335 square meters of surface.
The first store is in London.
The events, as well as the wish to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the competition board, made us find ourselves in a good breakfast at the opera Garnier de Paris.
With the next table of the Chagals, the presidential table prepared by Mango, it seemed even more spectacular.
Having a big heart and doing against bad luck, because of his brother's recent death, Nati put on Mango's clothes and some pairs of ELAH, who cut the breath, and arms, arms down with his son Luis - a beautiful man almost two meters high - she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as the Rochil Baron had finished the night without clothing because they had made it to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who was present at the store with a pants and shirt - from her own collection - and who, for dinner, metemorphosed in wearing a long and black dress, was excited when during the night visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the bathroom of ballet rehearsals and reminded us of the good old time, took one of the bars and had a big shower.
Ines Sastre is not left for the visit of the palace's independence, but she showed us earlier on her mobile phone pictures of her son.
The next morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another nice man moving in a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his troops, his servants and asking the predecessor, that there was no honor in his room.
From the stars under the stars of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, anti-stress number
There are only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of daily life.
And to cover everything, they are all repertoired in a book that will give the library a break on September 30th.
The morning morning wakes us almost every morning at 7 o'clock, but it's even worse when we think of the rhythmic activity that imposes on us the present life.
The office is synonymous of tension and the computer of pain at two.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no two ways to combat daily fatigue and the problems associated with the world of work.
But 1001, not one more or less.
In addition to yoga positions, classical massage or 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of a book all a 'menu' of methods suitable for taste and time.
The anti-stressed work is entitled '1001 ways of stopping ' and will arrive directly at the libraries of editors Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone believes that it is impossible to find peace in places such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' tends to be such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural revenues that help you to stop.
If the adrenaline is not short in your veins to restore the balance of your body and if the stress becomes a problem, it is time to sit in the canal, decompose its mind and concentrate on reading.
Talk to me when you're asleep
Some kids talk during the night.
I do not report to those who wake up very wake up telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who speak during their sleep.
The first time this happens may surprise you, but it doesn't really matter.
It's a blessed alternative to sleep called sleepy.
It's quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course there's more than one talking during the night.
This phenomenon may appear very sporadic (one time in life, for example, associated with a severe fever episode), or more periodicly (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child is no longer remembered.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance
They are often related to other changes in sleep patterns, such as nightmares, nightmares, night sweats, or somnobulism, but this is not always the case.
As we have already said, they can also be associated with very strong fevers, stressful situations or superheated situations.
Anyway, it's a little study phenomenon.
The intensity with which it is produced is also very variable.
He may speak with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, mumbles or, contrary to crises, tears, long speeches ...
In the case where sleep is very frequent, it would be fair to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes much anxiety and to get an explanation of the problem.
We said it's a blessing alternative, so there's no treatment, unless it's related to another sleep alteration that can be treated (for example, if it's related to a sleep appetizer or stress).
What we can do is take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to exaggerate the child before going to bed.
Therefore, seek quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who are suffering from dementia, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down inside.
This will allow the child to have a more patient smile.
As soon as dreams appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless for the child and that the next day he will not remember anything more than what happened.
Practical advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'll wake him up.
Even if he's talking, he's right.
Remember that if it appears very anxious several times, it is recommended to consult a doctor or to check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not normal), do not try to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because when you're sleeping, it's not conscious to be able to organize your mind.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, from the time you pay attention to how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can ask him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even crying.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts just a few minutes.

Illhaeusern finally found the path of victory on his ground after a long period of distemperation.
Without a big match, the Jaunes and Noirs created the largest number of opportunities and succeeded in transforming one for the win of the match.
The pace was not very supported during this meeting where the attackers had the wrong to express themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann who smelled the lucarne on a long drive, Illhaeusern would easily take the elevator and turn around the long Fenderflick, then with Hirn above, Romain of the foot or yet Diebold came to chat about Dannemarie's defense.
In front, there was a block in the middle of the ground and Rihai was just left to return to the point of attack.
The beginning of the second half-time was to be decided with the first two signs of Rihai and Temporal for Denmark, and shortly after the opening of the score for the Illhousians by Marais, well placed to take a ball on a first attempt by Diebold (53e').
But the Illhousians butler will not be able to enjoy his long-term happiness and will be forced to rehabilitate the clothingers for a dozen minutes later and leave his crew in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of and will not pose serious problems to an Illhosian One who just picked up a bit to "compact" his defense, hormis in all the last seconds of the game where, after a big casing, the ball went very close to the transversal.
Sarkozy to meet the angry fishermen
Before he leaves for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will travel to Britain.
In view of the demonstration of the strength of fishermen who were strongly disturbed by the access of several brown and normative ports, the President of the Republic decided to return to the port of Guilvinec in the Finistrere to meet their representatives there.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and expect him to "come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as the General Assembly of the "Crescent Committee" created by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures to deal with the cost of gas, which has reached a record of more than €1.14 per litre per litre.
According to Elysian spokesman David Martin, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses find competitiveness and to ensure conditions of employment and compensation for seafarers".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand by fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out unloading operations in Morbihan and Calvados, with about 10 km of mouth.
The happy port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the links to Belle Island did not stop.
A filtering barrier was launched on the island of Quiberon.
The seamen have already shown their determination to burn, from the bottom, pines and pallets in front of the warehouses of Brest's ports, and Lorient, while the demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic and the Manche, such as the Olonne Sabels, in Vendée, where the chautiers remained at quai, or in the Havre, where twenty ships blocked the movement of commercial ships.
The fishermen from La Turballe and the Croisic, in Loire-Atlantic, stopped at night the bloc of the important Total Donges refinery.
Those of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting to be held in the Ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday on the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the national fisheries committee, who did not support their movement.
"The famine will continue" because "the fishermen will not miss anything" and "they do not want to move to Paris," for example, said Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay gas taxes, are currently about 50 cents per litre, but they believe that a ship's profitability threshold is only reached with a gas of less than €0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman the great
The incredible interpreter of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died from cancer, at the age of 83, in his home of Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes have welcomed the legend of the film and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embrace the maintenance of its delivery forecasts in 2008
Brazil's 215 aircraft released this year despite the threats of recession on the world economy.
The fourth world aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 delivered devices, confirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, his president.
In the first half, the pilot delivered 97 planes.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes much of the Chinese market, especially for its range aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider paying more than 15% of its assets
The U.S. International Group, which the American monetary authorities have refurbished, plans to allocate more than 15 per cent of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that has been advanced to him, according to the Dominican edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international insurance policy and its activities back to the United States, namely the newspaper quoted close sources of the document.
The Board of Directors of the AIG met in the evening to consider possible concessions, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained with the AIG.
The assets that the AIG intends to separate include its International League Financial Corp airline, its 59% participation in the Transatlantic Holdings Ressurer, as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the FT.
No final decision has been taken on these concessions, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly make liquidity in order to repay the loan of 85 billion that the Federal Reserve has allowed it to take 80 per cent of its capital from the US authorities, disposing of the current shareholdings.
Analysis Paris Meeting History Morning Meeting History Morning Meeting
The New York Forum accused a historic drop Monday following the rejection by the Chamber of Representatives of the Paulson Banks Rescue Plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, or a loss of sight at 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) extended from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most severe loss of its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the date of the resume of the exchange after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
Nasdaq, a technological dominant, passed 199.61 points to 1.983.73 and the Standard & Poor's 500 8.81% extension index (or 106.85 points), to 1,106,55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street collapsed after the unexpected rejection by the Chamber of Banks Saving Plan representatives who were supposed to be able to find some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes to 205, the representatives denied the Secretary to Treasury Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two Republicans of three rejected their plan.
"It is a bad signal sent to the market, which sees the Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows the extent to which the market was concerned about this plan," she added, fearing that a project adopted for several days will not be "too late".
"If the project is actually deadly (...) then the relaxation will be made quickly to the Fed (the Central Bank of America, dllr) and to other central banks to manage the crisis, which would make the credit conditions worse," said Brian Bethune, director of Global Insight.
And with increasing urgency, "every day that goes by brings the loss of a financial institution" to the United States, she stressed Ms. Piegza.
After Washington Mutual failed on Friday, the authorities organized the arrest of Wachovia’s bank activities by its Citigroup rival.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated rapidly, leading to emergency banking interventions in the United Kingdom, the Benelux, Iceland, and Germany, indicating that markets are facing "not only an American crisis but a global crisis", the financial FTN analyst added.
The compulsory market has increased strongly.
The result of the 10-year-old Treasury was 3,632%, 3,827% Friday evening, and the 30-year-old was 4,161% against 4,357% of the guard.
Obama, winner of the first TV doll
At the first Friday debate between the two candidates at the White House, another one happened to know who, John McCain or Barack Obama brought it.
Surprisingly, the Republican and Democrat QGs have declared their own victory in this television tragedy that would have been followed by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honorable, has not been "beautiful" enough to allow him to pull his down in the presidential polls for five weeks.
The Gallup Institute, which has published a survey of Swedish opinion, gives five points to Obama (49% to 44% to McCain), argues that it is the democracy that has taken its lead in the game.
Among the indigenous electors, who are those who count, Obama is a winner for 39% of the probes, while 25% of them give the victory to McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama should be able to confirm his progress on Thursday with the expected good performance of his college student, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
It has good instincts," however, Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The Septuagint McCain had not stopped putting forward his indisputable experience in foreign policy, while stressing the "naïve" of his opponent on those issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
"Senior Obama doesn't seem to understand..." accused several times.
"I do not believe that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president," he also said.
An attack angle marked yesterday in Republican television advertising.
Obama stressed to him that he was the future.
Without a demonstration, he showed himself discreet and precise.
It has put forward its ability to make good decisions and to restore the image of the United States to the world.
"McCain has not always understood, while Obama, yes," said this week-end, a democratic spot renegotiating the Republican's failure to take all the measures of the impact of the crisis on the "American street".
"During the twenty-ten minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, he said Obama yesterday, before 20,000 people gathered for an electoral meeting in North Carolina under a fighting rain.
He did not even utter the words "meaning class" or "worker." The financial performance clearly benefits Obama, which is considered by the Americans as the most important to save the economy on the front of the precipice.
"The next week could be a decisive tourr," he estimated, yesterday, the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an elder from Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current decline "is the final outcome of eight years of a poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reaffirming that even if 95 per cent of US taxes could be reduced despite Wall Street's surplus, the Illinois Senator also noted that the country's possible energy independence by promoting renewable energy was its first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, he wanted to build a park of 45 nuclear centers from here by 2030.
The two candidates failed to raise questions on the financial saving plan of $700 billion (470 billion) adopted by Congress last night and extremely unsustainable.
In Minsk, "Did you notice there was a choice, you?"
Young people and opponents appeared on the main scene of the Belarusian capital on Sunday evening to reject the results of the legislation.
Several hundred of Biélorusses met on Sunday after the closure of the voting offices on the central part of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against President Alexandre Loukachenko's authority: "the dictator, the resignation".
Some people say they haven't even voted, "How good, because they'll do what they want from my voice," said one youth.
They do not believe that the regime that has done so represents foreign observers in order to regain language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic shift.
The sanctions, including the ban on visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the gel of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered by observers themselves.
They weren't against him.
"We have been held apart from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the deposition," said Iouri Potemkine, the Union's spokesman for the Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous group of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change, notes Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate for the 2006 presidential opposition and head of the European movement file, because the important thing is to count the voices, and to us, is the executive power.
If opposition Members enter Parliament, they will be appointed, not elected.
But their entry into Parliament may mean space on television, meetings in regions and legislative proposals."
The opposition must therefore be involved in the political struggle because "it is necessary to start dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which is deeply rooted in Russia, is in crisis, and we are not reformed, we risk becoming a protector of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that has followed the electoral process does not recognize the validity of the withdrawal.
She stressed that the participation figures seemed too high, and that the generalization of the vote by precipitation (26 per cent of the voters in Minsk) opened the voice to all manipulations.
"Have you noticed that there was an election, you? asks social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the voting offices.
And there will be at least five Members of the opposition to Parliament, those who deserve the best."
The silence of the night goes back on the place of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission are pleased with their success.
The interview - Blood returned safely
Hema-Quebec celebrated his 10th anniversary of his foundation yesterday, and his President, Dr. Francine Décary, had reason to rejoice because Hema-Quebec became one of the most secure and effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, he recognized the public's confidence that had been seriously shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the virus of acquired immunodeficiency (IVH) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and the horror of the public, in February 1994, the Government of Canada set up a public investigation, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would no longer occur.
While Judge Krever was late to deposit his report, some provinces have set up a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Quebec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to provide all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began his activities, 38 per cent of the people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
In an effort to improve the safety of blood products and work on the ground over the years that have followed, we have renewed public confidence," she said, before strongly affirming that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94 per cent of the Quebecese population now had confidence in Héma-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that "trust is something extremely fragile."
Since its creation, on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At this time, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was seen in Europe in many cases of the human form of the disease of the cow, which has been strong since its foundation in 1998.
"And we didn't know whether this disease could be transmitted by blood.
It was then supported by one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which, when we do not know it and that a serious disease can arise, in the event of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is characterized by a degeneracy of the brain that inevitably leads to death, exclusion is introduced.
In April 1999, therefore, the blood of people who had lived in the United Kingdom for more than a month has been rejected since 1980.
But a few years ago, he was shown beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode has thus shown us that the precautionary principle that has been applied has meaning."
In 1999 a much more sensitive technique of HIV testing appeared on the market: nuclear acid tests (TAN) that allow the users to detect directly in their blood the presence of the virus itself and not the antibodies against the virus, on which the tests were used so far.
TANs have been able to re-examine the mutate period, which extends between the time when the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
This has significantly reduced the risk of some donors being infected without knowledge and cannot be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, a person of 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Héma-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission occurs by a blood product.
I think it can be felt today that it is easy to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health," says Hema-Quebec's head.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what pathogen will appear in the system.
Not later than last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Meeting, which, at the time of the West Nile virus, was transmitted by an insect in the blood.
It must be constantly monitored," continues Dr. Décary, before stressing that in addition to security supplies, Héma-Quebec must also provide adequate supplies.
"The needs are increasing because the elderly population is growing.
Anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a recharge in red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the blood donors network, which includes only 3% of Quebecs eligible for blood donation."
Everyone in health, aged 18 years and above who meet the eligibility criteria can still give blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of those offering their blood are not accepted, as they are victims of AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria is severe, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
The injuries are very rare.
But the members of this network of donors need to be renewed as they grow older and can no longer give their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life today is so busy, we rarely find time to spend an hour giving her blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone marrow, heart valves, eyeglasses and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, transformed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank in Quebec.
The ombular cord, which was thinned as a biomedical waste, is absorbed by a rich blood in dry cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We have celebrated, a few weeks ago, the banking of our millennia sample of cordon blood and it is planned to take more than a thousand a year.
We should begin to propose it for flu attacks at the beginning of the next year," says Dr. Décary, describing this program of blood clotting as very popular.
"Many mothers are deprived of access," because Héma-Quebec has no means to propose this complex and cost-effective program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - The semi-final Impact
The Impact of Montréal was qualified for the semi-final round of the first USL elimination series, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 in total targets) victory at the expenses of the Seattle Sounders yesterday, at the second and decisive match of the fourth final series to the total goals, in the Saputo Stadium.
The field environment Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After a first tenth without purpose from one side to the other, the field environment David Testo and Rocco Plantentino marked the other leaves of the exhibitional training.
Roger Levesque was the only one to enjoy Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
We recall that on the first round of the return series, Friday, the Impact had a 2-1 defect in Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in Seattle.
The impact will be measured at Vancouver Whitecaps in half-final.
On Saturday evening in Minnesota, Thunder compounded a 3-1 deficit in the game back to import it 4-3, but the Whitecaps have all the same access to the semi-final round 5-4 to the total goals.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
A letter - But Winners of Kovalev
The third Canadian number is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Thomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack in a Canadian 3-2 win against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, marked a goal, Plekanec has mixed two aids, and Kovalev has taken a step in this race, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only purpose of the fuse.
"I'm not ready yet, the Russians have prevented.
I need another match to feel easy."
"He tried too much in the first period, said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a great ovulation."
Charest me on the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude elections before the end of the year
After the General Council of the Liberal Party finished, Jean Charest arrived yesterday in Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) tried to make an election on the occasion of today's partial election.
"Response the limits of our last large northern border": this is the long-term ambition Jean Charest has presented with visual force still in the big lines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
In his speech, he was designed to create a sort of Mowlin in images.
On three large screens, they turned into spectacular displays of hydroelectric barriers, mining operations, from Quebec, seen by Google Maps, cards, etc.
Large means such as in electoral period.
In the press, the Prime Minister also refused to exclude the election from that automation, even though he noted that his time was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth Pan of a "vision" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, the new economic space, which includes an agreement on working with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
The opening of the North - the Northern Territory at the 49th parallel - has often been mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently.
However, the prime minister was asked to explain why the North was “a huge potential joy”, but it did not give rise to investment amounts, or a specific priority in future projects.
At least a few things could be further developed: including hydroelectricity, forest, but especially the mining sector, due to the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond", according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "tier territory twice as large as France", "it's with us, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it with us, but it is with us," he insisted, as well as to show that he was requesting a national-founder myth.
Québec built a lot in his relationship with the North, he stressed: the street to the gold in Abitibi, the Quebecese engineering, the Baye James.
"It's for us, it's for our future," he added, after having taken a dramatic break to track the huge map behind him.
North, 70 per cent of the Quebec territory, including a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, told the Prime Minister at the press point.
"It is a traditional position that all governments have repeated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and when the opportunity arises, I repeat this position on behalf of the Government," he said.
In the rest, "with climate change, our view of the North needs to be reconsidered," he said, talking about the passage of the north-west, which will open all year due to the source of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister considers that the occupation of the territory is a duty.
And the people of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very careful about them and that the project would benefit them, including young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (formerly former Member of Ungava), have already begun consultations with 30 communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, where Julie Boulet (Natural Transport and Resources) began work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "a common vision will be given".
The development of the North would also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "cooperative, orderly and respectful of the environment", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as continuing with that of the first Liberian Prime Minister who had done so.
"Like the liberals before us, we thought otherwise to transform the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes at the end of the week, which was opened on Friday by a large cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the party's head.
One of the resolutions adopted proposed that the Beauharnois Centre be rebaptized in Barrage Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, in Lesage, who made the Peace Revolution and the Nationalization of Hydroelectricity in Bouurssa, who made the Baie James, our part has forgotten the future," Jean Charest said.
In a press release, he called for another reference, a conservative one, the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric barrier project, Mr. Charest stressed that his service was planned for 2012.
"It remains between us, but I expect to be there," he told his soldiers, causing them to cry out.
In fact, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and no doubt in 2009, did not differ from the possibility of launching this automation, as permitted by the law.
He points out, however, that his schedule is fulfilled, in particular by a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Québec-New York summit.
At the end of the week, the General Council provided the Liberian Chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including “constitutional aspirations” that were passed as a post letter: the PLQ specifically demands recognition of the “specificity of Quebec” in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council and that the latter had a veto right to decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, large lines of the North Plan were welcomed with scepticism.
The Pequist chief, Pauline Marois, drew up the North Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to it, the Liberal Government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If he had done so, "we'd be more advanced today" commented Mrs. Marois on the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (who is present today), Françoise Mercure.
ADQ said to support the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," commented leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letters - A Distorted Country
Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (Ironie) in Harper's cabinet, allowed the last summer to say from Louise Arbour that she was a "honest" for Canada.
So cast the condemnation on this woman who has fought inextricably for justice and who deserves all our admiration as long as the prime minister is surrounded by Stephen Harper himself.
We are looking forward to a government that is the only one, including all the Western countries involved, to have not repatriated its resident in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the facts he was denied.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, repeats its word and lets a child of a soldier into inhuman conditions.
Only one who submits himself to a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Let us recall that UNICEF, the International Amnesty and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, complain about Omar Khadr's repatriation so as to benefit from a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that closes the eyes of torture: it doesn't matter whether a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, no doubt ever after so many years of action.
We are still not aware of this, but we are now assisting in an insinuating erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", the word that Harper does not stop laughing and that sounds like he believes in his mouth.
This is the time when no morality exists: we can be cruel, torture, arbitraryly imprisoning a Canadian citizen according to the good will of a government chief until now (if it will be after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that violates the Vertu, the Law and the Order: they do not see that the government has rejected what is being done with our country's reputation and dignity.
Shame, Mr. Toews, she's here, in this rebirth, and no more.
Free Opinion - The Orwellings of Barrick Gold
In his September 17th edition, The Debor published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of the Canadian Mine Director Barrick Gold.
For an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest oil company has attempted a continuation of six million diffaminates against three authors and a small publishing house without the noise in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, this is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of prosecutions, but the law.
Not surprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to go to ruin anyone or to support a position contrary to the sign?
No matter how important the process is, the authors and editor of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defence and to fight against an army of lawyers supported by almost empty mines.
The tactics, in these inegal struggles, are often used to destroy the defenders in order to impose a regulation to the friendly, which will bring the opposition further to any who will think again on the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before the public opinion that she had to present her vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is happening in many countries where Barrick Gold works, Canada's debates are usually based on exchange of ideas rather than on matrices.
Thus, it was sufficient for the mine to open its books, records and establish a genuine debate through newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent research teams that could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to rely on public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support to the authors of Northern Canada.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he could both ask for a "public" debate while ignoring the opinions of the same public?
In the world of the vice-president, it seems that this word refers only to fatly paid lawyers and not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even the dictators have the right to say the word.
What you don't understand - or you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does it primarily because he rejects the brutal way of mining.
This public is ready to hear and judge Barrick, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many consider to be a baillon process (for the "public debate", Barrick Gold has also been planning to deposit a permanent deposit in the place of the authors of Northern Canada who intend to stop the use of this term...).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surprise speech, Barrick Gold's continuation is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the quest for truth, essential to all democratic society.
It is not, in short, the right to quote credible sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which is the basis of even intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that move the world's rich business into a country like Canada, under repeated persecution, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Northern Canada.
She has a right to respond.
The university environment, to which we belong, has long been known to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's follow-up clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no wish for a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place devices that limit this type of abuse.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Hear
The Bush administration and Congress file heads, both Republicans and Democrats, have finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic saving plan since the Great Depression of the 30 years.
The new version of the US $700 billion plan to bridge the financial crisis that has been behind Wall Street for months must still be buried in the two rooms of Congress.
In particular, it provides for a better control by the elections of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public funds committed, new provisions to contain the number of households seized for failure to pay, as well as a right to review the salaries paid to the managers of the insurance companies.
The US Secretary of Treasury, Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes later last night, at the end of a two-day round of negotiations.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective on the markets," said Bush's representative, Henry Paulson.
"All has been done to open up the real economy and the ordinary Americans of the ongoing crisis in Wall Street," the democracy explained.
"This is the main point: if we don't do that, the traumatism, chaos and disturbances in American daily life will be enormous," said the Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned to sprint in the last hours by fear of the effect that would create a new gap on investors' humor.
The time limit to be granted was the opening of the markets this morning.
As a result of the negotiations, the two candidates at the U.S. presidential election proved to be more favourable to the agreement, without having to express their discontent that they were obliged to reach that end.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama has been assigned to add certain provisions to the agreement, including those aimed at enabling the owners to keep their home and that on the pay of the leaders of the companies that have been rescued by the State.
"When the contributors are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the responsibility of some, there is no cause for rejoicing.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the waves of American television.
Asked on another channel to find out if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, answered: "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The great lines I've read [show] that it's something that we all have to say and with which we can advance.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to buy with the money of taxpayers the suspicious, risk-active and inflatable credit of the US financial institutions.
It is after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the release of a real estate bull that first led to the collapse of risk mortgages (substantiated) before it extends to other broader forms of credit securities (PCAA) and is based on a ice of liquidity and the decline of banks and financial institutions.
This is a group of Republican voters who had managed to master the first draft agreement, last week.
It is believed to be from this gap since the Democrats have accepted that certain "toxic" assets of difficulty companies are guaranteed only by the government, rather than by purchases.
In order to round the corners of the world at Congress, a provision was also added that if the Government had to make losses for five years with this programme, it could put in place new taxes to help it recover.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first cut of 250 billion, which may be added to 100 billion other if the President is required.
Another vote of the Congress should be included in the other 350 billion votes.
In exchange for his assistance, Washington will receive participation in the assisted companies that will benefit the dividends in case of profit and will be able to repay when the tournament is over.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to delay the procurement procedures for housing related to the real estate loans concerned by this plan, as well as to set limits on the remuneration and start-up compensation paid to the managers of the affected enterprises.
The architects of the plan would like to see him voting in the House of Representatives today, and in the Senate of Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have green fire.
In fact, votes continued to rise against this project yesterday in both the Republican and Democrat camps.
"Of course, Washington doesn't listen to you," said journalist Scott Garrett, member of the House's Finance Commission.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one who is to benefit from taxpayers."
An animator of a small group at Congress called "the Caucas des Sceptiques", democratic representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred outstanding economic teachers, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to us to say: we are asked at Congress not to press and carefully examine the way to take," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe there was a new evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French Bank BNP Paribas informed that it had refused to acquire its full shipping competitor since it lost EUR 2 billion (2.9 billion) in the US real estate loan crisis.
It employs 85 000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and ten larger insurance companies.
"It's not money lost, the Dutch Minister of Finance, Wooter Bos said yesterday.
In exchange, a right of vote will be recovered in the bank and influence.
It's just something that savings and households appreciate now that time is uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other hand, the British Government seemed to be able to nationalize another bank damaged by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take into account the total current loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander said yesterday that it was she who would buy the subsidiaries and customers accounts from the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an icon engaged
His beauty in the eyes of gold had long been his card all over, some would say his weakness.
Was he released from the Narcissian mirror, the American actor in the charmer's smile?
Yes and no.
His power, his sensitivity and a talent that was the source of his power would also have distanced him from the record of power that was born to the true sacred monsters.
But what a great depth running!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at 83 years of age, from a lung cancer in his joint of Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinemas for years.
Fewer monumental than Brandon, who had been a sort of rival to the screen for a long time, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also sought freedom and the elation of dramatic conventions.
The mixed blood is often a marvel of children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
Of these European roots is one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without self-delegated, last brand of quality.
Because it is designed by a country that is proud of its own self-made hands, of the fighter of the war of the Pacific, who, in the early 1950s, studied the dramatic art in Yale and then frequented the actor's Studio in New York before triumphing in the theater, television, and soon in the cinema.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also the car pilot who was seconded at 24 hours of Mans in 1979, twice a six symbol, which was a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadow areas of this secret, discreet, engaged, allergic to the corners of the show-business are also disappearing with him.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
Paul Newman's disappearance sought refuge in the cinemas this weekend, while his great roles on the black screen of memories are intertwined.
More than a half century after a seventh American art in permanent change through it.
Reminiscent of remembering Butch Cassidy's charming Cowboy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejected his sensual husband (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on an adaptable tank of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we mention his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
There are so many other Paul Newman in history.
This criminal, tortured, violent boxer in Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, who was actually released in 1956.
This sympathy in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best film in 1973.
Amer billiard and winner in the magnificent The Hustler de Robert Rossen (1961), he will take the person back to The Color of Money of Martin Scorsese, who won him in 1987 his only Oscar on nine nominations.
This face over the years, it was him.
He's still here.
The times are slowing down through its course.
Young people especially know it through George Roy Hill's most cultural Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a little orthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers in 1994.
With the latest role of the Irish mafia in the Road to Loss of Sam Mendes in 2003, the hole was broken.
In the face of a number of legends of the film that were late in the afternoon, Newman will remain in the cell for a long time, while discontinuing Hollywood, his gold, his steels and his concessions.
The French film Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not humorous, "as a living challenge to "underplaying" judging its over-supported performances.
The profession has not always been designed for the beautiful Paul Newman to which the roles have long fallen all over the bed.
However, it plays less often than young people who are marginalized: nervous, alcoholics, salads or despairs, whose perfect treatments reflect the fruits and the revolutions.
As a realist, Newman reveals unknown faces of his true Pudic sensitivity.
Her husband, Rachel, in 1968 (according to the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), and her husband, Joanne Woodward, played a major role in the development of a female metallic portrait.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose gave him his film Harry and Son in 1984, worked with pain and sorrow.
Among the rain of men who spent yesterday on Newman, his great partner and former armed partner Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very excited: "His presence has made my life and this country the best."
Generosity, the love of existence are the vibrating treatment of the missing actor.
In addition to its legendary career, a major activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protestary of Hollywood's revenues.
We will have seen many of its beaks nesting on vines, juices, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of eating bad tastes, whatever it takes to start.
However, the benefits of these sales were paid to its Children's Fund in difficulty.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left to his five daughters a letter containing these words: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be here."
And it's a privilege for us to follow the course of an American artist so bright and so generous.
Citizen model, in sum and above.
What could make Zuschlag &mp; Company in their invoices factory?
Next, on 8 October, hearings relating to the ongoing criminal procedure will be held against János Zuschlag and his complexes.
Politicians and their complexes are accused of fraud, in the form of criminal organization, permanently and regularly, resulting in particularly significant damage. Other leaders of the charge have been held against them, for example, false and false use.
According to the park, the money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money from the State and municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, was part of the Fiatal Balldal and part of the movement, in a few people.
Their method, also made public by the authorities responsible for the investigation, was to address the money from the grants received by issuing invoices, which were not provided and thus did not respect their commitments.
According to the indictment act, a large part of the invoices were incorrect.
For the latter, they were looking for invoices at the Jozsefváros market, while they were making the caches in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that were to be included in the invoices, it was decided, inter alia, during the tournaments in the north of the Balaton Lake, carried out by István Lados, on the request of Janos Zuschlag.
According to the deposition of the latter, he had to look at pensions and restaurants.
For its personal consumption, he asked for a bill, on the model of which they would implement the other invoices that they would introduce, inter alia, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and the Municipalities of Capital to access grants.
The majority of invoices were created by István Lados and by his complex András Üri, which, according to our information, was mainly concerned with preparing the files needed for the grant.
During a "reperation circuit," one of Lados' choices was a bishop.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place provided for the restoration of a group of 90 persons, members of the Biztos Pont Egyesulet Association.
However, according to the manager's report, it would have been impossible for as many people as possible to take care of this place at the same time.
In the same way, in the summer of 2002, the invoice set out in the name of Jobb Jövőrett Foundation, which will then bring the name of Egypt to Harmadik Éveveredert, was based on false form and background.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there. However, the bill mentioned hundreds of customers.
In their accounting, Jobb Jövőret, or Hoppa, did not appear, according to the information in the park, when they mentioned the Pigal Kft company.
Győző Farkas, company manager, told hvg.hu that when the park called him and showed him the invoices, he found that he was wrong.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the cover."
He added: "Out of the shape, the fact that hundreds of people lived there, did not take it anymore, because this facility only counts for 11 rooms, which are not so well-placed.
Furthermore, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The publishers of green invoices were no longer informed about Budapest travel agencies, taking part in their selection, but only organizing foreign travel. Thus, of course, they indicated lodgings in Hungary on invoices to settle in species, which is also due to the Agency's accounting practices.
Moreover, as shown in the investigation, they also added VAT to these documents, while the benefits of travel activities, whose destination is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of four invoices established on behalf of the Hotel Revfülöp at Jobb Jövőret was incorrect, since the company's benefits do not support a 25% VAT as indicated, but a 15% VAT. Moreover, the hotel employees only issue printed invoices, while the fakes were made by hand.
The survey in the park reveals that the "emissions" also made errors by referring to road freight transport, which the issuing company could not carry out, since its profile was the investment council.
In addition, it is also for visas of forms, such as inadequate invoices and false caches, that invoices issued at the Order of Egypt in Harmadik Éveveretre Alapitvány, of XXI. Századi Culturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont have been found false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehertó’s sports stadium, which both refuse to be the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
The counterfeiters did not pay any attention to the fact that HIB Kft., located in Nyiregyhhaza, was liquidated at the time (in 2001) the Fiatal Városert Egyesület group was intended to take a meal with them.
Detailed factors
Another category of invoice issuers is that composed of those who were fully aware that they were asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapest Foundation Alapítvány, at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal Group - Ifjj Socialistták, has established a invoice for the Együt Foundation in Harmadik Éveveredert, for a total of four million HUF.
According to the indictment act, the manager of Collab Kft. was brought to file false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Also, he cooperated with the Zuschlags, the Biogate Ltd., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003, issued invoices to the Jobb Jövőret Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület and the Vörösfenyő Egyesülett Association, for an amount of about five million HUF, but later no performance was actually provided.
There was no financial movement, no more, since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but the agencies were very careful not to mention it in their accounting.
The following category of invoice companies is the company directly related to the accused.
Thus, the administrative delegate of the Director-General of the Delta Trió Kft Company, who is involved in the business of fuel and motor vehicles, whose social headquarters was in Budapest, but where it was located, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices on the sale of computer equipment for an amount of approximately 18 million HUF.
According to the investigation, these equipment would have been purchased by the Cash Investment Ltd. company in Kiskunhalas, which was liquidated since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a Romanian man who would also have obtained documents with respect to the company between 2002 and 2005.
As we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he had issued invoices to the company Atlasz, Hoppá and Egyyöt at Harmadik Éveveretre Alapitvány, and that he had persuaded them against their value.
It is precisely at Ivan Kubatov's request that Romanian bears created Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Ltd. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies were operating, which explains the accused because they did not receive work.
It is also the case of these companies, because, at the request of Master Zsolt Sainte, co-accused as well as the editor of company foundation documents, he has established invoices on their behalf, on the basis of associations related to Zuschlag, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáção.
Kubatov provided agencies with 15 total invoices issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade companies for a value of 14.2 million HUF.
The park thought that 10 per cent of the invoices and VAT were available in the village of Kubatov.
He even used Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fictitious invoices that were used in the application for Bistos Pont grant.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generation and Society in Modern Magyarszágret introduced a grant application to the socialist party's public utility organization, Máhály Alapítvány (TMA).
They received this grant for a double amount of 500,000 HUF, but these amounts have not been used for the purposes indicated in the request.
To avoid this, five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
In addition, these invoices were found during the investigation carried out in the office of Árpád Kemexei, at the Ministry of Education.
In the hearing, a party of the accused will refer to the method of making invoices, as it had already done before the park.
What could be really interesting would be that the main accused, János Zuschlag himself, decided to raise the street all over history.
So far, his eyes are not very detailed, and although he has promised several times to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or if so, socialists would have concluded an agreement that, in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would only bring the chapter.
Today, the latter is likely to be raised, as requests for his residence in monitored residence, on the basis of an allegation of his detention conditions, continue to fall in the ear of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much more serious damage, and the perpetrators of irreparable economic crimes, freely or at least, wait at their own home for the end of the procedure.
Surgeon Psychology: why do we spend more money?
In sales to customers, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the market.
Researchers in neurology and economy at New York University have succeeded in updating the neurological and economic bases of this well-known and apparently irrational behaviour.
According to their study published in Science magazine, human beings do not want to be distanced from this type of competition, such as a sale to eBay entrants, and that is why they prefer to pay too high prices.
These research have tried to develop a neurological scheme of this kind of "play" using sales to experimental endings.
One group of volunteers played in the lobby, while the other group participated in a sale of toys, while using a functional magnetic resonance process (IRMf), researchers analyzed the active brain areas of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants were able to earn money, but during the sale to the entrails of which a key element is the surrender of a third, the whole being under the brain trunk, called striatum, was moving intensively at the loss of the party.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the "auto-stimulation" mechanism of the nervous system.
That is why, according to researchers, the price increase is explained with the escape in front of the violent reaction of the strip.
In support of their theories, the members of this group of researchers continued financial monitoring analyses.
In those cases, three groups were on the way to face a partner, under different circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product concerned, and thus carried out their implementation.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they would profit from the party, they would receive $15 additional, in return.
While the third group received those $15 before the fines, the members of the group also lost that money, in case they lost the fines.
The difference between these two groups is that the emphasis was placed at one on victory, while the other on the other.
By thus proving the hypotheses of neurologists, members of the team of players "against the back" were prepared for higher tasks than those carried out by the control group and the "victor" group.
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
In fact, each of them explained the phenomena found in sales to the entrants only by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped to eliminate the contradiction between the two theories by starting with a third explanation." - Andrew Schotter, professor of the University of New York's economic sciences.
Hepatitis: When do we have to consult a doctor?
In the world, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the first causes of death.
Hundreds of thousands of patients are estimated to be infected with hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven miles follow treatment. This is because patients often do not know that they are infected with the virus.
Hepatitis is a generic name given to liver infections and caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of liver and kidney are characteristic, but pathogens and engenerous diseases differ from one another.
Hepatitis virus, according to pathogens, is primarily spread in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g. food or contaminated water), hepatitis B, C, D and other blood and organic fluids (sem, vaginal secretion, salive).
For travelers, it is highly recommended to vaccinate against virus A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after consumption of contaminated foods, generally accompanied by poor general status, weakness, stomach pain and nausea.
Then it develops on the skin and on the white eye a visible yellowness, the cells become clearer and the urine takes a more intense color. The healing can take two to three weeks.
Throughout the world, each year, one million people die of the worst form of this pathology, such as cancer or liver cirrhosis, inherited by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that according to estimates, only one patient in ten receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it may lead to a cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients are unable to reach the virus, because pathogen gene suddenly destroys liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular testing.
Pollution is much higher than the average of one population of three groups: people who have had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and addicts.
Currently, 200 million patients are diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C in the world.
Since the disease can be detected by a laboratory routine examination, it is recommended to consult your doctor who has been treating symptoms of unknown origin.
The disease can be cured if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, thus the risk of contamination disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
30 September is the World Day of Hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 by agencies representing diseases of the four corners of the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Do those who believe in God feel less pain?
According to recent research, religious belief would serve as a sort of analgesic, which would have already contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more supportive.
The British Telegraph daily published an article that researchers at Oxford University have made an interesting experience by analyzing the extent to which belief in God could influence tolerance to the pain of human beings.
As part of this experience for the least extraordinary, 12 Catholic and so many atheists were subjected to electrochocks, while each observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholics have been able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a human brain palpation technique, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brains responsible for the regulation of pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences, with academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians participating from different sectors of the university.
More specifically, the experience is carried out in the following way: an instrument that emits Ethicles and distributes electrochocks is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked participants of the experience to look in support of two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady at the Hermine painted by Leonard de Vinci in the 15th century.
Researchers at the beginning of this experience hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would mention a kind of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from that of the first, would have had a fascinating effect.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in an IRM scanner, and during this time, 20 electrochocks were received in four parts, although the painting on a religious theme or on a more general theme.
The Catholics said that in view of the Virgin Mary, they felt as "safe" as someone who "cares" and are "satisfied, and peace has invaded them."
In view of religious thematic painting, they accounted for 12 per cent of the pain in less than when they looked at Leonard's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself participated in the experience, thinks that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image in the Athames, provided that the appropriate photo can be found.
"We should find a picture to which they react very positively, such as a mother or father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, an English bishop, welcomed the results of these research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases, indeed change our personality," Wright added.
After these excellent results, is the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of subjects if it was shown to believers a Madonna painted by Leonard or a painter of the same caliber?
Would seeing a better quality Virgin Mary produce better results?
You're what you reveal about you.
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google claims that it can be found at the bottom of the people's mass as well as the sky above their heads. He knows where they have their holidays, which specialists they consult and which are their centres of interest.
This is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the most influential people in society.
As for the sceptics that set up a parallel with Orwell's watch vision, they just didn't see the essence of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt stated, there was little, in the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect more information on its users. This is necessary for Google Founders to be able to meet their initial goal, which was as follows: "Get us all information in a system!".
According to Google's manager, after ten years of global warming work, they are still only at the beginning of their goals to be able to process all information.
The question: what will it be in five years ? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to answer questions like "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What is the job that would be best for me?" However, the software will not be able to answer this kind of question, just for the first time, until the day when they will be enough on users.
It is not perfectly clear for all Internet users that the words used during Internet research, the IP address of the computer that starts the search, and the pages that are then consulted by interested people are specifically reproduced.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own research history and can consult what they have looked for. In the long term, recommendations, a program based on the same logic will be able to provide much more personalized responses, and we will submit products and services based on our previous statements and our registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he sees what my work is? ask users, who are worried about Google's information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by the society that can cause fear, and this is not the resort, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, or possibly the rebellion against power that can cause a counter-reaction among the netizens.
However, it is confirmed that the terms sought are not only recorded, but in case justified, they are transmitted to a third party, and in such a legal case, there is nothing to protect the personal rights of the internet.
The most recent example is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google sent to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus enabling identification.
Sociable internet users of the person's rights have been able to raise a spirit of reconciliation in May, when Google, with the EFF legal protection body, has proved its right to the FBI. According to the ruling, in the future, Google will not always be required by any of the constitutions to disclose information on the FBI's secret request, of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, voted several years ago. However, in the end, it failed to find out the search lists of private users, neither the entire list of websites and keywords of these two months.)
So Google's judgment is quite contradictory: it's captured by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their privacy and privacy are suffering when they start using Google's services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of rebellion against the high multinational societies of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "savageons" bringing together the passionate, activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of large companies, the "white corporate" by opposition to its rival, Microsoft, which is categorized as the world in charge of Windows, and this, even if they both fight for the same purpose.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentation code and the software package, continuously refresh, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect in front of the official software manager practice.
The reason can also be that the geeks see very precisely the problem relationship between human rights and the Internet, and what the web 2.0, the key word most pronounced in recent years, just goes beyond it.
In fact, the 2.0 website concerns nothing but collaboration, the fact that we deliberately leave behind behind us, and that we serve as communication channels made available to us, and while the size of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we are exposed.
A young person, in general, can have a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link them to other performances, such as Twitter, or last.fm, and listen to his musical habits. Then he can link them to a follow-up system, such as FriendFed or Blip.fm. These young people can also have blogs, in which they automatically appear their latest photo gallerys that they store on Flickr or Picasa.
While we can take many examples, such as that of the little friend who easily understands the morning's photos, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the evening, or the company that licensed one of his employees, nothing but for the sincere opinions he wrote on his blog on top management, we can be on one thing: the term of private life is completely rethinking our days.
The person who lives an online life is what he shows himself, and that is how the principle can be defined hiding behind the behavior of today’s young people.
He wants to hide something, or at least he wants to try to round up Google's monopoly, he can do it (for example, starting with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but at the same time not deliberately leaving any traces).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that they are not able to find them is not fewer. Google services, through the processing of text in image processing, can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to huge server parks and which do not match our best profile, which have been existing to date.
The public opinion waits, without really hiding it, the moment Google will discover its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). Publishers AdWords/AdSense threaten the number of advertising agencies' business, while the benefits introduced to a growing rate of serious migration occur not only in Microsoft but also in many other information programs.
However, critical observers find, on the other hand, contradictions that have a disturbing effect: for example, the company's top management has rejected, in its entirety, employees' protests, after it has doubled the parent's price of the company and after the company has judged too highly the multiple daily restoration, it doesn't matter. All of this seems to be critical of the fact that in 2006, Google has acquired before the Chinese government and in accordance with the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that harm the good, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the internal rules of the company, new services are only announced when they can be used. What is more, in the coming months and the coming years, they will move the world on new points. While some believe that the project of scanning and archiving books and magazines of Google takes such important dimensions that the company will soon face the U.S. Supreme Court, others who are alarming against its health system, because in that case, we can build a complete medical benefit from our previous analyses, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google sets up a genetic database can give a good first material to the next generation of science-fiction authors. The famous novel Cory Doctorow, written with half-tonnes orwellian, describes the future in which a man could be approachable in a way that only through Google's data.
Two minors helped to destroy the traces of Ózd's double homicide.
"The police called two minors to question them in the case of the double homicide of Ózd. According to suspects, they helped to eliminate the traces of crime." - declared the commissary's spokesman of Borsod Department.
Young people have acknowledged the facts that have been rejected. For the moment, they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to the information provided by MTI (Hungroese Telegraph Agency) are young girls, are free to defend themselves.
The complexity of killing may result in a detention that may take up to 5 years.
The suspect of the double homicide of Ózd, a young man of the 23-year-old county, was put in temporary detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicides, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it was found that a 23-year-old man had to pay a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn't want to settle his debt, and that's why he attracted his client, recently, to a site in Ózd where he killed him, as well as the 9-year-old little daughter of this man.
According to the information provided by the IMI, the young man has confessed his crime. The weapon he was going to commit was evidence.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw boutique makes a proposal for the defeat of the Prague boutique.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has proposed two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech Crowns, for the 100% share package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal by the Polish authorities despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of the new potential owners of the Prague Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw branch is located in the hands of the State.
99 per cent of the actions are in the hands of the Polish State, who wishes to separate more than 60 per cent of its actions in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic day E15, the Polish proposal is the highest offer that has been made so far for the strike of the Prague boutique.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna boutique, the Nasdaq transatlantic boutique, the New York Stock Exchange, the London boutique and Deutsche Börse made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague branch, said last week that the Warsaw branch would be the newest owner, and did not exclude the fact that it could result in the disappearance of the Prague branch in the future.
The value of the Prague bourse is estimated between 5 to 10 billion Czech crowns by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of the paper would be sold.
The most important owner of the Prague Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank, with approximately 25 percent of the participants, followed by 14.7 percent of the Ceská Sporitelna bank and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday devoted to the international financial crisis, the European press leaders' journals are now calling for a "second September 11th".
"The global financial disaster, we must be the American President," accused of Rome's daily, La Repubblica. "The President was not even able to block a bill with his own party behind him, improvised to the street, in order to help in an desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, like billionaire Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about a second September 11th.
A part of the Madrid press also sees the emissary mouth in Washington.
According to the daily vision of El Mundo, these are the shortcomings of the political leadership there that led to the global economy on the ground.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system increased every day, and the whole world will then pay the high price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, but after the Congress vote, a real danger, which Washington does not offer political tools to deal with the crisis.
The world economy lies in empty, just when in the history of capitalism, one of the biggest transformations takes place.
We can't ignore the longer-term threat - points out the Genève Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states may still have a rescue fund for their financial institutions, and with the money of their taxpayers, they can save them from failure.
Of course, if more and more banks are embroiled in such dominoes, then neither financial means nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long term, we need the states of the European Union to do little about their national self-sustainment and to focus on control over the divided financial markets.
No matter how much Monday, the weak financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - reminded Vienna's Day, Der Standard, which adds that fears that European taxpayers will also have to put their hands in the pocket, very deep, similar to Americans in order to deal with the crisis, become more realistic.
To date, the EU has not really been affected by the crisis, which, like a tsunami, is crossing, partly, the old continent.
The "savers" should not be spent at all in the next hundred billion euros, otherwise it would be fair if they noted that it would be reasonable to touch the money of taxpayers, with the aim of preventing further damages.
The smart car imitates the flight of the bourdon
What would be the best way to develop technologies capable of avoiding a barrier, if this is not the imitation of an existing obstacle detector already in nature?
Like, for example, the one of the bees.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC, which took place in Japan, the bourgeoisies gave the strategic idea of starting with Nissan engineers, to inspire them in the way they had to design the next generation of obstacles.
In collaboration with Tokyo University, Nissan built a mini robot vehicle, a bio-robotized control system of type BR23C, which has equipped baby qualities, the ultimate goal is to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
In its flight, each bee is its own space, oval form, which is actually very similar to our secure protection coke - explained at the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, director of the Department of Research and Development and Public Technology of the brand.
The face-to-face of the bee plays a primary role, since it is possible to see in all directions, in a 300-degree angle.
In order to imitate the functions of the facet eye, engineers have addressed the idea of the laser telemeter.
This identifies the obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 metres before the BR23C, it assesses the distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which transforms it into an escape operation all the time.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, imitating the movement of the bee, changes immediately the direction of its wheels by turning it into a sufficient angle to avoid collision.
In contrast to any existing system, this avoidance approach is completely instinctively carried out.
"If it hadn't been like this, the mini robot could not respond fast enough to avoid the obstacle," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotized car project.
It must act in an instinctive and instantaneous way, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of protection, a layer which, for the moment, is considered inevitable.
All this process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in an eyeline.
In contrast with the bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that have bees to avoid other bees, in our case, we can only use rotational movement, acceleration and slowing as manuals available to the mini auto robot.
The BR23C uses the Lithium polymer batteries which are smaller and whose energy concentration is greater, making them live longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is primary, not data processing, and even less storage capacity.
This mechanism must only deal with a few signals coming in second, and respond to those.
It is not necessary to store and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous manoeuvres. Thus, it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
We don't need to remember a giga-octets capacity, or even mega-octets.
This is the first step towards the design of a technology for instant protection. According to Nissan's estimates, this system will have its entry into the cars produced in series over the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on its path.
We even gave a name to the baby at no price.
The written version of the $700 billion savings plan, which seeks to buy banks' suspicious credit, and to be used several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of this sum will be spent.
Reuters announces that during the new debate, extending to midnight, on Saturday, the local hour of the east coast, Congress leaders have agreed on existing disputes for days and days, around the rescue plan of a total amount of $700 billion.
"We have taken a serious step forward," declared Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the American Chamber of Representatives, after which he is no longer making the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
The US Secretary of Treasury, Henry Paulson, commented on the results of the commitment that the programme will work and will be effective, but other measures must still be implemented. According to Pelosi, it is not a question of the salvation of Wall Street here, but of turning the economic routes in the other way.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday evening at 20 a.m., Washington's local hour (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m., according to Central Europe's local time), but did not cause a spectacular amount in the drills.
Monday, the Chamber of Representatives will be the first to vote on the proposal of law in response to the 2008 Emergency Economic Stability Act, and its fate will be among the Senate's hands.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke in Pelosi, and the White House also welcomed the new agreement.
"We are satisfied with the progress made this night, and we appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the spokesman for the White House.
In addition, the different programme of the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which mentioned that $700 billion should be spent on a single basis, in order to obtain titles on doubt credits.
The first 250 billion will be delivered immediately after the adoption of the Congress Act, probably Monday. This first amount will serve the Secretary of the Treasury to buy questionable bank loans, while the use of additional $100 billion will be left to the President's discretion.
The programme will be supervised by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The expenditure of the second half of 700 billion is dependent on a new decree of the Congress.
Under the law, the Treasury secretariat will be able to implement a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to purchase suspicious credit, titles on suspicious mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic credit".
The competent authorities of the department have stated that the raids may have a place in the course of a sale of bribes, but also directly.
The rule allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme, where the Treasury secretariat guarantees tools from the source of concern, for which companies will pay a premium equivalent to the expected damage.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the tools necessary to devote $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, to the wide range of doubt, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system resulting from the collapse of one or more important financial institutions.
"We shall take the necessary provisions, to be ready for the application of the law, as soon as it is signed," he added.
Instead, bank leaders who are in bad positions and wait for State aid can expect their payments to start, called simply extra-Atlantic parachutist parachutist, to be enveloped by the government.
Payments are only mentioned in specific cases. Moreover, the limitations depend on how the Treasury secretariat offers its assistance to the company.
The platooning principle means that if the Treasury secretariat is issued in the course of a sale to the entrants, they will take a surcharge on the debt-due parachut, unless the bank's discretionary president is part of the withdrawal.
Immediately after the loss of doubt, the Government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not exceeded.
For the image to be complete, it is necessary to add that the existing expensive parachutes are not modified. Plaphony concerns only the new contracts, this is to motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceilings will be in force with regard to the general directors' appointments - the President of the Committee on the Financial Benefits of the House of Members, Democrat Barney Frank, commented.
In addition, the State seeks a right of acquisition of shares in banks participating in the plan, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they may even be winning in the case since the economy and with it saved banks will return on their feet.
The draft law states that in the next five years, the President must present to the Congress a proposal that will provide for the return of losses to contributors from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were obviously those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
This is not why American citizens have given us a mandate, which does not protect taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican Member of California, Darrell Issa.
His Democratic Fellow of Ohio, Mary Kaptur thinks that these are the same who are taking measures, as are those who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

In the next year, will visas still be needed to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance that the American-Hungarian visa exemption agreement will enter into force on 12 January. That is what the Foreign Minister said in Chicago, before the heads of the local Hungarian community.
She said, "Now everything depends more on the time when other Atlantic electronic access and control systems will be used."
At times, it has drawn attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visas, but tourists will have to register before the start.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations today in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Condolezza Rice, who will present the decoration of the Commander's Cross with the Star of the Republic of Hungary's merit Order, and will have an interview with foreign candidates' political advisers at the presidency, the Barack Obama Democrat and the Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support both bank rescue plans
On Sunday, Barack Obama, as John McCain, the candidates at the presidency of the two major American parties, supported the government's savings plan of $700 billion. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the US Secretary of State in Tresor.
Following the marathon negotiations that lasted for days and days, representatives of Congress and Administration finally announced on Sunday that they had concluded principle agreements on bank saving.
This funding plan, aimed at the collapse of the Wall Street crisis and the parallel credit market, became the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain present themselves, each as more fit than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent surveys, with economic issues being raised, Obama has once again succeeded in making some progress. McCain's progress, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a corollary right after the Republican Convention, has been founded.
At a campaign meeting held in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed its hope that Congress would soon vote on the rescue plan of 700 billion.
He stressed that the proposal contained the consumer's protective passages that also supported it.
"It is now necessary to act, with responsibility (...) a danger to your work, to your economies, to the entire industrial sectors and to the stability of the entire economy," he said to a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not lack the economic ideas of McCain overextended.
In an interview on the ABC chain, McCain said: "We will all have the evil to evaluate (...) but nothing is possible."
The Senator of the Republic said that the proposal referred to the creation of a Treasury control committee and the imposition of the benefits of the departure of senior managers, and that he was, personally, very attached to these points.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had no role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Secretary of the Treasury.
Nancy Pelosi, President of the Chamber of Representatives, said on Sunday that there is a serious hope that the Chamber will vote on the proposal of law on Monday.
Press review of the German language territory
The right-hand field is intact, it is only in the heart of the party that the electors have become more aware - it is also mentioned by the Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of red and black.
Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the German left-wing magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic failure of the CSU in his article entitled "The Revolution in Bavaria Destroys Its Fathers".
According to this recognized politician, the CSU's erosion began well before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took its functions.
Christian socialists have transformed the Bavarian for decades and are now the same modern citizens that turn their backs on them.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and that is why Angela Mercer too.
For the CSU, the failure was not a surprise, but Sunday, a process likely to occur just ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, CSU was falling by 47.7 per cent, and this for the first time since the fifty years, with a score below the level of 50 per cent.
This was repeated three years ago at the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to modernization "on the part of its parents", which is placed in the region consistent with the CSU.
It took 40 years for sociologists to announce this, but they were very confused about the pace. However, the results of the secularization, education and the establishment of Germans in the north and east of the Bavière region, in full development, could not remain without consequences for the faithfulness of the CSU voters.
Modernization will be accompanied by increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right field is intact, but inside the party the electors have become more conscious, more critical and more conscious.
It is also surprising that over the past few weeks, this is just the groups of classical citizens who have been rather away from the CSU, such as independents, artists, bankers and higher students.
In these groups, CSU support decreased by 40 per cent.
The printer (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who ? With whom ? The presidents of the party stand on the reservation to the coalition issues", the conservative Austrian daily is concerned with the situation of the confused internal policy that was established after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian socialists of the SPÖ wish to discuss with the OWP conservatives.
The OVP banned SSPÖ from dealing with its internal affairs.
The populist party BZÖ is open for negotiations. Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
The elections were held, now all around the coalition; when discussions on public television were organized, the leaders of the party had to leave their cards to enter.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he would like to discuss with the OVP.
The SPA wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is effective - that is what is already in some regions and in socialist partnership.
The question under which he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the OVP, as vice-president, remains open on the part of Faymann.
As he mentioned, Schüssel-Molterer's orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A response to this combination is out of question.
Mulder has responded with caution to red proposals.
As he has already said, a collaboration will certainly be frustrating if Faymann tries to get involved in ODP's internal affairs.
In its part, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is currently an open issue. These points must be absolutely discussed within the OPP.
Jörg Haider, President of BZZÖ, is again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of red and black, we are ready to assume government responsibilities," said Haider.
Járóka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, which is France, has begun as a representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In his letter to the plenary, as one of the main forums of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, Euro Member of the European People's Party, drew attention to segregation in education, as it is a violation of the law that affects the most Roma children and, in this regard, one of the main threats to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs and, on the other hand, Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the persons invited to participate in the consultation are European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies in the area of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Group of Members Fidesz Parti Populare, Járóka has warned that, on the basis of the differences found in weddings, the Roma disappear from the labour market, first of all, as a result of their low qualification.
"A growing majority of young Roma do not have secondary diplomas, and as a result of an elementary education of poor quality, only a minority has the opportunity to get a higher degree."
Járóka also stressed that education as an element of human rights plays a key role when other fundamental rights are to be valued.
Investment in early education of Roma children means strengthening the economy of the member countries of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these reports in a widest circle, as well as between Roma and non-Romans.
In fact, as soon as a Roma child starts school, he increases his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
"From their nationality of the European Union, Roma must be guaranteed their right to quality education and be protected from low-quality and sectoral education."
According to the honourable Member, the European Union's cooperation towards a objective and action is necessary for immediate acceleration of the school disintegration process and for this, respect for existing anti-discrimination directives and preparation is of primary importance.
"We must break the vital circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment. We must give Roma children the opportunity to participate as citizens of the right to the future of Europe," Járóka demanded.
On behalf of the "European Year for Equal Opportunities" provided for all, the aim of the Summit on Equal Opportunities in Europe has been to provide a single platform to support measures to promote equal opportunities and combat discrimination, at European level and at Member States level.
CSU: thanks for a transition period
It is October that the decision will be taken on the fate of the Duo dehu Huber-Beckstein
Despite this subtle electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the meetings of the Bavaro CSU has been updated.
The president of the party, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still keep their place.
The end of the tandem, with a loss of 17 per cent cast vote, will be on the agenda of the assembly of the exceptional party, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this very criticised couple, however, felt that they were not particularly in their seats.
As a result, they were employed to attract the angry members of the group and the base, who one day after the "bavarous tsunami" claimed personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, even under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the Christian association won 60.7 percent, while today, one year after the potsch against Stoiber, it remains only 43.4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years, the CSU has been the "only sovereign" of Bavaria giving 18 percent of the German GDP.
However, conservationists are still very strong in this southern region, which is key to the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be bound to the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the vice-president and federal minister of agriculture Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, also received a place in this modest group of recognition, which began talks with FDP liberals, as well as with the Free Electors, formed along the lines of the right, on any coalition of the Government of Munich.
A strange nest of the target was only with the help of the List of Free Electors, in the legislation Gabriele Pauli, whose measure against Stroiber used the possibility of pussch perpetrated by the Duo Huber-Beckstein, then to treat the very ambitious municipal political woman without housing.
Now, CSU leaders are putting all their energy to stabilize, somehow or otherwise, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who has so far taken the seats in the colleges, will also have an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, appointed September 28 as the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber sent a few notes to the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support from the brother's party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defect as a warning to the CDU and also to Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will only be able to be Chancellor once again if they surrender in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the 2005 national success.
According to Merkel, hiding his disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of land of the CSU will not adversely affect the great coalition of Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the socio-democratic crisis will continue to persist.
Since 1946, SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavière.
Lukasenko - its rivax : 110 - 0
No opposition member joined the Belarusian Parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by a country headed by Alexandre Lukashenko, which ensures its prosperity and stability, while, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by the illegality of voting.
The OSCE, sending 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation made up of 110 million people in this country has been very opposed for decades, prior to yesterday's elections, the opposition unifying its forces under the name of the Union Democratic Forces (ODSZ) was seriously expected that Lukashenko, renewing its presidential mandate for the fourth time during the questionable elections, following the change in the Constitution in 2006, would "allow" this time the presence of some Members of the opposition to Parliament.
In this way, ODSZ gave up its original ticket.
The fact that Belarus, with a growing economic dependence on Russia, would want to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the qualified Belarusian anti-democracy policy order, Lukashenko and several high-level politicians did not receive visas was one of the expectations of the opposition.
The fact that the OSCE, when assessing the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than on shortcomings, such as the prohibition of being present for a third of the candidates to the opposition, was a reference to a preliminary appeal.
However, the OSCE Monday communication was already in response to the campaign, during which the majority of candidates to the opposition could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present when the votes were cast.
Nevertheless, the opposition is still a palpable improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have found freedom, and Minsk is ready to face small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize the South Ossetia and Abazzia separated from Georgia.
"We have done two steps ahead and one step back, but most importantly, the dialogue has been started between Belarus and the EU," said Alexandre Milinkevich in our journal.
According to the candidate for the 2006 presidential election opposition, it is desirable that this remain, even though "the power in this Parliament which has no weight is afraid of entering into even one opposition."
The opposition does not provide for protest actions in view of the results, but rather tries to reach out to its message on the need for economic reforms with the electors.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns about this: we have to print our opposition newspapers in Russia, the local authorities put us on the streets for what is broadcast, but I can also see that they are more likely to support the elections, even in the circle of older people," Milinkevich said, referring to the fact that in the current system of Lukashenko, which considers social security as its main result, the most officially supported retirement is no longer considered as appropriate.
"Because of the identity of the country and the rise in the commercial deficit, the collapse of social security, 'encouraging the silence of a cemetery', it is no longer a matter of time" - I believe Milinkevich.
In contrast to the opposition policy, Russian observers qualified democratic elections.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the Community mission of the Independent States, told the Russian press agency Ria Novosti: "People don't believe in words, but in acts."
Brunetta: "From today, a little breakfast before work."
Never in the history of the Chigi Palais, there were no turning doors for the entry and departure of employees.
But since today, this new measure has been in force against small pigs, against which coffee will be taken and will then be drinking in the bar during working hours.
The new anti-fraurants were presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the President of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The turnout-telling doors Brunetta- is a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services," the Minister said.
Now a new season of responsibility and transparency begins.
"It's Reformism" is also stressed by Brunetta.
The installation in all the institutions of the Presidency of the Council is complete with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of turning doors is even important from a symbolic point of view.
No staff resistance has been recorded, the Secretary-General ensures: "It is a process shared by employees, and we have all worked together".
In short, less breakfast during working hours; more coffee or growing.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests, "a good cappuccino at 7:00 in the morning is an excellent and healthy resolution".
At a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the communiqué minister said that "in three months, the absence of public employees' disease was reduced by 50%, or more than 60 thousand workers in one year."
And he adds that it is necessary to make it more effective, the Public Administration.
Italian, "including wage dynamics" explained the Minister-in the past 8-10 years have doubled in relation to the private sector, as well as inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees are united to challenge the standards of the Brunetta Decree applying to the Codacons.
" while the Minister of the Public Service today maintains that the data on the reduction of unemployment at the workplace for the cause of disease- writing the association of consumers- the people of "active workers" continues to increase.
In Italy, thousands of employees from the proper and productive public administration met to declare war against the illegal standards contained in the decree.
In particular, Tar is opposed to the exclusion of additional allowances in case of infirmity due to service; the extension of the hours of home-to-home stay of the sick worker, during which visits to control are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions of the Minister's wishes.
Accidents at the workplace, Napolitano: "Crescent Prevention"
Each day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 persons who remain permanently disabled are reported.
In 2007, Inail's data confirmed that white deaths were about 1,200.
Numbers that testify to the severity of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death, and cause almost twice as much death as killings.
To draw attention to institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic aspect, Anmil is now celebrated today, in all Italian provinces, on the 58th National Day of the Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data transmitted by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of these last days, confirm the importance of the prevention of work," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, when sending a message to the President of Anmil, the National Association of Mutilated and Incapacitated Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his sincere appreciation for the continuing association effort to prevent workplaces, protect workers from accidents, assist victims' families and raise awareness of public opinion.
"Of course, everyone has hit the bridge to put an end to such tragedies that, by their size, causes the media clammer and the participation of public opinion, even if the daily reality presents us with dramatic, even repeated cases in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty to pay attention to this phenomenon, not to assess the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
On the other hand, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed the importance of "this phenomenon of white death is an absolute social emergency, which condemns the conscience of each of us, and obliges all institutions to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly."
The data on work accidents seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths being even impressive" later highlighted the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this "trembling at the rabies" to be translated, in fact, into a less attention, because it is just when the attention relaxes, that is the tragedy.
"we believe that in general, we are not done enough to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be achieved through multiple actions."
"We have stressed that Mercandelli-More controls and inspections are necessary, as well as more important intervention on the training of workers, and this, from school."
- He added: "An additional effort must be made with regard to the communication and awareness of public opinion.
"But, above all, a greater sense of responsibility for employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
"Mercandelli then declared "the progressive deterioration of the conditions for the protection of compensation provided for the victims of the work" and "the source of assistance to which the system has originated in recent years".
"The aim, therefore, is to give the worker the guarantee of insurance - it has been added - so that the fate of the person having an accident does not depend on spontaneousism or the extension of the legislator"
Mp3 reader points of touch, they put the audience at risk.
Listen to loud music for a long period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission, which, in a communication published in Brussels, refers to the Scientific Committee's opinion on the unforeseeable and recent health risks (Csseri) of the EU, published today.
" of this scientific report, we note that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to loud music using portable music devices, for more than one hour a week, risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that so many young people who often use portable music devices and full volume mobile phones can unwittingly damage their hearing," says Megella Kuneva.
" According to scientific data, the responsible Ue- continues to be a clear risk and we must respond quickly.
What counts most is to raise awareness of consumers and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems with scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise generated by them.
"Scientists conclude that Ue-executives confirm that there are good reasons for concern and that the European Commission will now consider with Member States and other interested parties what measures may be taken to better protect children and adolescents, against exposure to noise from similar portable music devices and devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the level of noise of music devices to 100Db, but the concern increases as to hearing damages that may result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these data by using solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise.
The Scientific Committee notes that the users of portable music devices, who listen to full volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the current limits on the maximum level of noise allowed at work.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for extended periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This is of interest to 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be estimated at about 2.5 million and 10 million people in the United States.
Rome, Germany has ordered the Commission to do so for the future of capital.
Today we start, in March, we end up in June.
Here is the calendar set by the Chapter for the work of the "Committee for the Future of Rome Capitale", which took place this morning at the new headquarters behind the Terms of Caracala.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other components of the Commission will implement the directives for Rome.
In March when they have finished, the Committee and the Council will assess the analyses and projects, in order to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the " Official Timber " of the Capitol and its Director Gianni Alemanno.
" The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there, and it will continue to highlight Germany - it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome, which will be useful for policymakers, which remain the Committee and the Council.
No superposition of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, it will have completed its tasks and then disappear, because this experience must have a precise time.
In June, the mayor will present us the strategic plan for the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital. "
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, given that its views will not be burdensome, Germany replied: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am on it, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is managed by day-to-day management and the emergencies that occur from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to see ahead, and further away, towards a deeper prospect, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the mayor of Rome notes that "this Commission is not an unnecessary body or bureaucratic body: it is absolutely free, and will not cost one euro to the Roma citizens, and it will serve to study and participate in the best intelligence that expresses the capital.
For Germanyno, in fact, "there is a need for a development of a strategic reference, not a firm or real estate, in order to allow our city to improve, what it absolutely needs, while considering its future now as a united spirit."
A future which, according to the capital of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual community borders, but which will look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first American president, that's why.
"Barack Obama will be the second American anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, in part of his decisions, destroyed the US economy and took up reports (as others have always done today as a private citizen) with the Islamic enemy."
Attacks against Obama increase as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition".
Obama is truly disappointed: he believes he will gain the highest role of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, it is attacks that do not say much; they are of course racist nature, and they do not answer the question of all voters: will there be a good president? We also have the polls, which all declare that Obama will win and have a good advantage.
In this case, it's still about someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the interiors of the United States, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know exactly who the American patriot will give his vote.
That's where an aspect of American mentality emerges to the end.
"Tell me what you want, we'll see ourselves to put the cross on Obama or on McCain.
There are even those who swear: if Obama gets, we leave the United States.
Things that have never been revealed so far, to such an extent that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
In spite of all these reasons, the winning card for Democrats is George Bush.
A request was made to 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent replied: Iraq.
America changes.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 miles of soldiers and was sent back to it by foot.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost their lives, and Americans have not been forced to make the toilets.
Nevertheless, Iraq was, for the most part, the point of weakness of Bush.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge task to do.
Usa, the economic debashion is made even among journalists: in the press, it's the time of removal. And many people accuse the Internet, this "killer" of the paper.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center on the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists are pessimists today about their future.
However, they have not openly declared access to information, feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated as sometimes.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a devastating economic model crisis.
In addition, the removals made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work in the press collection, are a major problem.
It is a problem that must be resolved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism is to be understood by the general public, it will not be reduced accordingly.
An obvious but complex pessimism engulfs American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and press journalists are convinced that national journalism is following a wrong path.
Locally, the executive group is 65 per cent.
Printed publication against broadcastcast.
Journalists don't have any trouble seeing where the web is going.
The biggest publishing houses are on the Internet, seen by many as "the killer" of the newspaper.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to technology hoping that it would "make something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest growth in American journalism lies between those who run the newsrooms - that is, the directors and reporters who work for them.
56% of managers at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this is linked to "work safety".
Directors who are thinking of losing their job in 3 years are 47 per cent at the national level.
With regard to journalists, we're going to be 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (we editors, etc.) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a vast nation like the Usa, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and this quickly becomes a question of taking or leaving.
Directors receive almost always large salaries, while the editor can earn $10 billion a month, in addition to retirement and payment of insurance.
As for holidays, logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, passed a number of years.
But, according to their findings, American journalists are often "damaged" during the year.
It's the climate's fault.
UNIPOL:RIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPOLA REST A GROTTAFERRATA.
The President of the Second Criminal Section of the Rome Court, Carmelo Rinaudi, decided to reject the property agent, Danilo Coppola, who had requested permission to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a residence in Rome.
. Coppola is investigated for banking under the Unipol-Bnl scale instruction.
During the trial at his post, last week he had obtained the release of domestic freedom converted into compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked that the real estate agent be able to cross the street from the city of province to a apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (which the pm did not grant) would have an effect on his company and have access to evidence that accuses him.
The elites are in danger.
The phenomenon had already appeared a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion saved plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms us that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its vigilant soul East Coast, moderate, favourable to the federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, host to "the people of Washington" and the world of finance, which is particularly powerful in the Central and South states.
The soul, just, has been made to feel despotically with the vote I spoke to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is just an example of the changes, major changes that the economic earthquake in the course of its advance or is already running: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and can only be here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena that have been covered for a while, to such an extent that in the new climate, they are strengthened and revealed.
The first of these phenomena is the renewal, the extraordinary relationship of the double category of sovereign State, with regard to a sort of economic reunification.
The crisis is, in fact, a crisis of banking and financial institutions which, of course, have close relations with the outside world, but which, above all, are largely involved in the balance of people and families living in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for the government: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are also electoral.
In short, the crisis seems economically global but politically, it's almost national.
Political internationalisation seems to be really out of play or out of play, but there is nothing to say: the clear evidence is provided by the European Union, which, divided as usual, between the various interests and the various national strategies, does not reach a common political line.
Thus, it is from the Government of each State that all wait for interventions, rescue and relief plans, new rules, and especially for the provision of credit: when a difficult period is over, there is only one state that has economic resources, the amount of financial resources capable of trying to put things in place.
They also have the necessary means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of an invaluable value, elements that no international market or organization could ever have.
This new phase of the state-nation crisis remains in perfect harmony with the ever greater importance that the recent economic developments of the economy tend to attach to a sufficient factor related to this element: territoriality.
. Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we are now entering the realm of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of non-material, that globalized finance was now intended to dominate the world, we have come to account once and for all, that our future will have to deal with more and more with less material things like water, crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from place to place on the ground, but which are absolutely related to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
So, who is sovereign, he certainly has more cards than one who is not, that is, one who has the evil to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now arrive at the second novelty which, however, provides for a fraction.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who is able to take into account the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discretion for existing leaders, economic species that have been found inadequate and full of shade.
Moreover, something even deeper, in some sense, even worrying: a disrepute, suffering, an inappropriate image, a sense of distance that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of Western countries.
This increases the conviction of the various classes, before actions are the same ideas of social elites until now, how to listen and be, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, at the same time, and to be more and more foreign to the opinions of the majority.
in brief, The demand for leadership, underground food, a powerful and co-mixed movement of delegation of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which is reflected in the unprofessional electoral "revoluted" revolutions or, in the recent recent changes of collective moods, from the conservative assent in Austria to the fall of workers in Great Britain, to the rebellion of American Congressmen against Bush (and it might well be that the victory of the right in Italy was not achieved by Hasard).
The impression is that traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their newspapers, their intellectual credentials, their format, would say something, there is still more difficulty, which is not today, to understand and thus represent the deep roots of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is growing, increasing and potentially increasing.
In view of all of this, speaking of a current "mass rebellion" on the agenda seems to be quite exhilarated.
But let's say well, keeping the big eyes open, that's not without reason.
The supercolle to walk on the walls.
Win the laws of gravity through a super-colle and, in the future, walk on the pairs like Spiderman.
This is the goal of several American research centres, and today a team of four institutions has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring up to five inches [2.5 cm] square, researchers were able to keep a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
The Study- The American Science Review published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is a development of those we know who use a particular carbon structure called nano tubes.
"The principle of the hill can be imagined as a series of tubes available as a spaghetti pill." explains zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by geckos' pads, covered with microscopic dust that enables the animal to ensure a perfect adhesion.
The tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than those reptils, and at the same time that it "depends easily from paroi" explains Liming Dai, researcher of the University of Dayton Engineering.
MARCHER ON THE MURS? –""This material could be used as temporary adhesion" adds Liming Dai.
Could it be to walk on pairs like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use, such as the connection between electronic devices, since carbon nano tubes are heat and electric current drivers.
Other applications could concern aerospace engineering.
For now, not super hero.
The AURRE RESERCHE - The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesion.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, California researchers presented an adhesive of microfibres like hair, which cleans dust during movement on a surface to ensure perfect and constant adherence.
Medicines: Never with fruit juices.
Attention to the papplemous, orange and pummel juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in the summer because they are desultant and rich in vitamins, if associated with certain vital medicines, in altering or reducing absorption as appropriate, their effectiveness, with even serious health consequences.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether in butter or in cash, if associated with the ingestion of certain medicines; during the 236th American Chemical Society meeting in Philadelphia, he launched a new alarm: enough wine of cotton, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of certain vital medicines, reducing their beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
The papplemous judge has already been strongly criticized as it held responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotics, anxiolytics, stimulants and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
MEDICAMENTS A RISQUE- It is the Italian Medicine Agency itself, who has given the news in a two-year information booklet, warning physicians and patients not to assess the danger arising from this mixture and to make sure that it is discarded, if medicines are taken, such as Diazepam or Methhadone.
WHAT PAMPLEMOUSE- According to experts, even the orange and pummel juice contains substances that inhibit medication.
Longue is a list of active principles that are inhibited by the pamplemusse and the other jus.
Since then, Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology at Milan's Public University, called: "These findings are generally reported immediately to the various national and international drug agencies that will be required to change the information notes of medicines.
It is always appropriate to read the illustrated papers of the medications taken, and, if something is not clear, do not impress, but address clearly to the doctor or pharmacist," the expert pointed out to Ansa.
The Nobel Prize for the Economy in Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize for the Economy was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his research on trade models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a neo-Chinese teacher at Princeton University and is also a famous editorist at the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's failure, Krugman had written, in an article published on New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in view of the consequences of the US history.
It is a forecast that has been rejected for years, but that has now become clear.
"I am surprised and even somewhat shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals such as Enron's or Worldcom's collapse has disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a very aggressive prosecutor, particularly critical of the excessive liberalism of Bush administration.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti-Micro" package
This is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the next open source of personal productivity that aims to touch more and more users, from house to house, from public administration to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following a work of almost a year, carried out by volunteer developers, supervised by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the public with a variety of innovations: the welcome screen, and the revised and less Austrian interface, to others more important, such as the born compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 track, and it is possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, some features specific to certain modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the sizes of PowerPoint presentations, for example, are useful for sending them by email, or for importing PDF files into the graphics module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front, it is possible to create "PDF hybrids" documents that combine the typical Adobe format graphics with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text developer.
The collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, several users can intervene, avoiding conflict on the changes, in the drafting of texts, as a colour of comments is assigned to each partner for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to generate some of the OpenOffice's functions on the Web (on the cloud, on cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should issue the final result.
The Italian version is downloadable at http://it.openoffice.org/Download/0.0/Download300.html and is added to the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is also available as usual for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD may be sent home or at work.
And if the topic of freeness can be a means of spreading it in the homes, it is just in business, that the Open Office then presents a major challenge, which can already depend on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
Without account of the realities that provide training, consultation and assistance, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also be open to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Write, for the same text video as Word ; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Print, for the powerful PowerPoint submissions;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on the databases; eventually Drwa is the graphical module.
Target for 2008, reaching 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are nearly 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure.
Kohl too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New positive case in the last Tour de France: it is about the Austrians of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the best Grimmer mail.
This is the website of the daily team that reports the new.
At the age of 26, Kohl is the fourth positive cycler in Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Ricardo Rico and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests performed on Kohl's trials are part of what has been done in recent weeks, by the laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Maabry.
If anti-analysis confirms the positiveity of the Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place in the Tour and will have to wait for two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positivity to the third generation Epo was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordy, who communicated to the Associated Press, had notified the Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the bottom floor of the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus raising the e-mail from the best grower.
Immigres: NEW YORK TIMES ARE DEADING IF ITALIA IS RACIST?
Italy "as a country of immigrants has recently been transformed into a privileged destination for immigrants" hosted by reticence.
Would this turn the Beautiful country into a nation of racists? Here's what concerns New York Times who has devoted a long article discussing the subject of racism in Italy, from the case of young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed the last month in Milan, to fly a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what New York Times define as the "North Paradox": the Nordic regions are both those where it is recorded" more integration and more work", but also "a strong anti-immigrant sense of the country and the most important support to the North Law"
In order to confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
Even the new legislation required by the Law to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of clandestine prisoners is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
The attitude highlighted by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, when he met with Benoît XVI in the Quirinal, requested that the State and the Church work together to win racism."
Students who are victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
The student rental market did not know about the crisis
According to the last survey of the Sunia, the rental union, renting a simple room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects of the exclusion of all categories of young people, the right to study at high global costs that income families must support and explain the responsibility of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the strong demand of the students has so distorted the market that an overall increase process has begun for residents.
In most cases, rental offers also include a series of violations: free type contracts, not registered, no rent limit, sub-locations.
For the Union, extraordinary measures through the revision of tax tax are needed to ease prices.
In detail, we see that Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, needs about 450 euros; for a simple room, it's going from 650 euros (the Black Band area), to an average value of 800 (the Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (the Vittoria zone)
In Florence, an average bed, EUR 350/400, a room is approximately EUR 700.
In Bologna, where students focus on the nearby areas of the University, there is a need for EUR 250/280 for a bed in a double bed, and from 370 to 500 for a simple room.
In Rome, in the vicinity of central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are required for a simple, 450 for a bed in a double.
Lower values (550 euros for a single) for the nearby areas of other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
It can only be saved if it is distanced from the periphery areas: 300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a simple in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, 300/400 euros are needed for a bed, for a simple, costing from 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, for bed, it is necessary to account for at least 350 euros for a simple one.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of greater importance in the city economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which rentals are often taken by extra-Community students, are listed further anomaly: the rent requested for foreign students is increased by 25/30 per cent compared to that applied to Italians.
Adieu old cinema Paradise, the cities are the historical halls.
Historical cinema rooms are closed for Multiplexs.
"A city without cinema rooms is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The picture offered by the photographer Giuseppe Tornatore, well illustrates what is happening in the great Italian city centers, but also in the cities of the province,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in periphery of large halls, and the death of mono rooms in the central areas of the city, is one of the major events that makes us undisputable and undisputable; it also has all the features of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, these are often historical and memory-loaded places, "it's like if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a lot of road and so much emotion" observes the film player in the Nuovo film Paradiseo, which offers Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar and the Grand Prix of the Cannes jury, and who reported the poetry of a provincial hall, and the nostalgia of a way to live the cinema, may be lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main trader association, say everything: the last five years, 316 cinemas of traditional type have closed, and these are the rooms of the main cities that paid the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 less in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions by closure, Emilie Romaine is headed by 82 cinemas mono rooms lost, followed by Toscane (44) and Lombardie (41).
The evidence which confirms that the first person responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is well the three most recent Italian regions that have recorded the most recent multi-sale cinemas: 195 screens in Lombardia these five years, 81 in Toscane as in Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has developed irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it should also ensure the survival of those who already exist, because when a living room is closed in a city, these frequencies are not necessarily all ready to go to multiplex.
Without talking about the lack of credit for traders, the previous debt of the State is about EUR 10 million.
It is a shame that, from a ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between 16 and 18 million euros per year.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about these closures, has decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a protocol between Marie and Anec, the first of which is in Italy, to defend and promote the single cinemas in historical and periphery centres.
Among the regulations provided for, there are measures of tax facilities for managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the restricted area and will have special rates for stations and in some parking areas.
"It's an initiative I'm asking for," observes Giuseppe Tornatore, and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna setting up other measures.
However, it is clear that, in order to counter the superpower of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, as today's public is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the essence that convinced me to make the "New Paradise movie that I've been thinking about for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I go to the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have so much shared emotions, I turn from the other side to not see the dark panels by dust.
Links between politics and 'dragheta, stop mere of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to unify Mary's choices to the interests of the Piromelli clan."
There are serious accusations made by the judges of the Calabre Anti-Fraud Directorate, against the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for massive association.
The coins are also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his little lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already convicted of association of mafia-type offenders, and paying 10 million euros.
"a conflict with the legal and moral norms, and especially with good intentions," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay consultations at Master Piromalli.
"If it had been given to the clan - writing the judges - to enter officially within the chambers facilitating the possibilities, already significant, control and orientation of the public administration"
The president of the Calabrian Regional Committee Agazio Loiero, only covers "collusions between local committees and organised crime, there is more than one" in his region: "there are places where the massive intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the dragongheta, heroes who are honest."
The arrests this morning followed those of July last, after which the police announced that the Piromelli clan had disappeared.
Since the end of April, Gioia Tauro's community council had been abolished; already in 1991, and still due to alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been deprived of their duty to administer the City.
Giorgio Dal Torreone, head of the UDC at the time of the resolution, had been appointed head of a right centre coalition after the May 2006 ballot.
He created the scandal when prefecture ordered the dissolution of the community council.
He accused the Deputy Minister of the Interior of the time, Marco Minniti, who accused him of handling everything for a political issue, but in view of the application for imprisonment signed this morning, the judges explained that the Piromelli clan had even succeeded in asking for a change in the A3 project.
Among the interventions ordered against Dal Torreone, pm writes, "the availability of a business man's requirements, representing a more well-known group, close to the Piromalli, aligning the public administration's choices with the interests of the clan.
When energy is born of waves, the bigs are now launching.
This is a depleted supply that covers more than 70 per cent of the planet's surface and now the world's major energy companies are now finding out.
Vagues, currents, marches, here are the new renewable sources on which colossors like Chevron have put their eyes, and now they're trying to put their hands on it.
The possibility of energy from marine movements has been studied for hundreds of years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil dropped, in 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the ecologists and the new increase in oil is making a big contribution to the sector.
London's World Energy Council (WEC) estimated that in 2007, 15 per cent of the global electricity demand could be covered by marine coal operating systems.
This would be the double of the nuclear power plants.
And in addition, there would be runners and mares..
Colosses to attack.
The first shipping company was Enersis, who signed an agreement to build an installation in northern Portugal in 2005.
When the agreement was announced, it would have been said a true revolutionary step.
Two years ago, more and more candidates from these dedicated companies have always focused on traditional energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies," said a company's spokesman associated with the American oil column, the Wall Street Journal, and it assesses the possibilities of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question relates to the acquisition of a permit issued by the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to provide for a marine energy operation project in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if it is considered that just in Alaska, Usas continue to extract oil, and recently President Bush has put in place a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which cross the way of the energy coming from the sea, and the investments to date, although their details are unknown, indicate a growing interest among observers.
Technology to focus.
Experts are still talking about technology at its beginnings, in part because marine energy does not dissipate fears against the ecological impact.
Currently, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small and do not seem to create a major problem in the ecosystem.
In order to produce large-scale energy, however, technologies must be used with a higher environmental impact.
"And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of pumps connected to each other.
The push of the waves, which pushes the bows up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the fleets.
The pressure is turning a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
The energy is sent to the river through cables under the sea.
At the moment, we have four systems of this kind in the project phase, waiting for a single federal approval and a part of energy could serve as a military facility.
On the contrary, Power already produces energy for a commercial centre and a parking using six turbines under the East River of New York.
The movement of water in the seas, turning to turbines, creates a rotary movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant announced that he had a long list of clients waiting for the necessary powers to power the energy.
After the vagues, the marites.
A particular interest, they tell the Institute for the Research of Electric Energy, which is now worth the potential of marines.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the marina is more predictable of the wind, the sun, or the waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it's just on the energy of the marches that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, and others, looking at the coast, invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and planned investments up to 35 million in 2009.
