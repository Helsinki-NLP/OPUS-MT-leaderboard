White pedone to f3, black pedone to e6, white pedone to g4, black woman to h4 - black sacto! This is clearly indicated in sacchistitic circles such as "scock matto".
White: Tower in a1, foot in b6, king in c8. Black: legs in a7 and b7, king in a8, alpha in b8. White places the opponent in the zugzwang playing the tower in a6, after that the Black has only two options: take the tower in a6 or move its alpha into any other layer on the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the White makes progress on its foot from b6 to b7 and gives a sharp shot. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black foot in a7, with the same result.
