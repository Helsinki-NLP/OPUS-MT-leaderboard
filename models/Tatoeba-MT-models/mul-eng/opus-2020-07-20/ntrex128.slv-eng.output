Members of the Valianian Congregation are concerned that they are "like Mupetkom"
Some members of the congregation have been threatened with the proposal to appoint the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, etc.) after a new appointment.
This has led to plans to change the name of the congregation in the Valian Parliament.
Members of the congregation in the entire political sphere are concerned that they will be ridiculed.
A member of the congregation of the laburists said that they were concerned about their group, "the name of Rome with Twp and Pwp."
For browsers outside Wales: Twp means a trap, and pwp a cat.
A member of the congregation from Plaid Cymru stated that their group as a whole was “not satisfied”, and proposed other options.
The Italian conservator said that his "open spirit" group was different with regard to change of names, while he warned that there was a small difference between MWP and Muppet's words in speech.
In this context, the phrase ‘w’ is similar to the phrase ‘u’ in the Yorkshire Order.
The Commission of the Congregation, which is currently preparing a draft legislation for the presentation of amendments to the name, said: 'The final decision on possible descriptors for the members of the congregation will certainly have to be taken by the members themselves'.
The Valiant Congregation has been authorized by the Government of Wales Act 2017 to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Valian Parliament.
For members of the congregation, the Commission has chosen the name ‘Welsh Parliament Member’ or ‘WMP’, but has received the highest support in the public consultation.
The members of the congregation clearly offer other options, but the achievement of the agreement will be a difficult task for President Elin Jones, who must submit a draft amending legislation within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will also include other changes to the way the congregation works, including rules on the incompatibility of the functions of the members of the congregation and the formation of a committee system.
Members of the congregation will participate in the legislative debate at the end of the vote on their appointment.
Macedonians will decide with the referendum to change the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday whether they will change their country's name in the 'Republic of Northern Macedonia'.
They want to resolve a ten-year dispute with a neighbor of Greece, whose province is named Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that the name of their northern neighbours represents the right to their territory and has repeatedly contradicted its application for membership in the EU and Natu.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an anti-Pelbistic opposition to the change of names, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including the President of Zoran Zaev's government, claim that the change in names is the price they have to pay for EU and Natu's accession.
The bells in St. Martin's church are confused, because the churches in Harlem are faced with problems
"The older people I talked to said that they were sometimes at the bar and the church on every corner," Adams said.
‘Today neither one nor the other.’
He explained that the disappearance of the bar is understandable.
"People are different today.
Bari are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people go on a regular basis."
In the churches, however, he is concerned that the money from selling funds will not last as long as the leaders expect and that they will soon be again.
He added that the churches could replace the housing buildings with the common administration (condominiums) where people who will not help shelters in neighboring areas are still living.
"A large majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be whites," he said, "and that is why the day will come when all these churches will be closed, because it is unlikely that the people who will move into this condominium will become members of these churches."
Both churches built the Belgian religious community before Harlem became a black metropolis – a metropolitan community in 1870 and a decade later in St. Martin’s.
In the 1930s, the original Belgian methodological church community was isolated.
The stand was taken by a black religious community that was doing the service of God in the vicinity.
St. Martin’s took over a black religious community under the direction of the honour of John Howard Johnson, who is on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, led a fighter of sellers who did not want to hire or support the dark-fashioned.
The fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Johnson’s stepfather planned again, the bells were ordered to attack.
David Johnson, the son of Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's church, proudly called the bells "voice for the poor."
The expert attending in July referred to them as a little different: "cultural background" and "unresponsible historical instrument".
Specialist Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first voices to be played by the dark-eyed singer, Dionisio A. Link, who went to the Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he was attracted to the larger bells.
Mr. Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
In the church of St. Martin’s, in the last few months, a complex story with architects and contractors was held; some brought church time, while others were scofy.
Zakristija, the administrative body of the medicine company, wrote to the bishop in July that it would “try to bear the costs” on the jury, although it was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some Jews complained about transparency on the part of the bishop.
Marine dog injured 13-year-old while hunting horses in California
Officials report that on Saturday, in California, the marine dog attacked and damaged 13-year-olds while hunting horses while opening the season of hunting on horses.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near the beach Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he met his friends about half an hour in the morning when he heard the boy cry for help, then he flew to him with the group and helped him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought that the boy was just excited because he caught a wildling, and then he found out he was screaming, "He bit me!
He's mad at me!"
When he came to the boy, Hammel noticed that he had a broken whole key.
"I said all to go out of the water, 'The fish is in the water!'," he added.
The guy was brought with the helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains critical.
The type of marine dog responsible for the attack is unknown.
In a press release, water rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said that a few weeks ago in this area a sea dog had been observed, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered a serious injury to the upper body.
In 48 hours, it was not possible to access the Ponto Beach beach in Casablada to Swami's beach in Ecinitas due to research and security.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of marine birds in this area, but most of them do not apply to danger.
Sainsburys plans to enter the UK beautiful market
Sainsburys comes to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beautiful cots, as they have in large shops, and with professional staff.
As part of the entry into the British beautiful market, which is worth 2.8 billion GBP and is growing, while sales of clothing and household appliances fall, more beautiful cotton will be tested in 11 markets per country and in several markets next year if they are shown to be successful.
For input into beautiful products, the supermarkets have been decided because they are looking for ways to fill the police used for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
In Sainsburys, they say that they will double the offer of their beautiful products on 3,000 products and they will first include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing brand L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also receive more space in areas with brands similar to those in stores like Boots.
The Supermarket also restores its commercial supply of cosmetic products, so that most of the Vegan products are – something that younger buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the trade perfume Fragrance Shop will test the concession in two Sainsburys shops. The first opened in Croydon in southern London, and the second opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham by the end of the year.
Because of online purchases and daily purchases of less food in local stores, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, executive director at Sainsburys, said that retail trades would be similar to wholesalers, as the Supermarket Union is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl discounts with more services and non-life products.
The Sainsburys group opened the outlets of Argos into several hundred shops and also the Habitat trade, since it bought both of them two years ago, which increased the sale of food and the acquisitions were more profitable.
The previous attempts by the supermarket to renovate their compartments with cosmetics and pharmaceutical products have failed.
Sainsbury’s joint venture with Verigo Boots began in the 21st century, but the relationship ended after the dispute over the distribution of profits from drugs in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical company with 281 companies of Celesio, owned by Lloyds Pharmacy three years ago.
They said Lloyds would have a role to play in this plan, as in four markets, they would have to expand the supply of luxury brands rather than skin, including the brands La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director at the company Sainsburys, said: "We changed the view and touch of our beautiful boxes and thus improved the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in particularly qualified staff who will be available for advice.
Our brand offers are designed to meet all needs, attractive environments and convenient locations, and they mean that we are now interested in a beautiful destination, which poses a challenge for the old way of buying."
Peter Jones's "heavy" because Holly Willoughby got out of business worth 11 million pounds
The star delivers Dragons Den (Good Business) warm because the television director Holly Willoughby withdrew from his business, worth 11 million pounds, with his commercial brand of life to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of clothing and Truly's supplements.
Business couples compared the trade mark Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
The leader of this morning, 37, published on the Instagram to get away.
Holly Willoughby destroyed the dragons De Petra Jones award star because at the last moment, she withdrew from her commercial business with the trade mark of life to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones was “bessen” when the gold girl in the Tuesday in the busy meeting of her company in Marlowe in Buckinghamshire admitted that because of her new business – up to 1.5 million pounds – there was no time for their brands of clothing and accessories to be revealed.
The companies compared the trade mark Goop Gwyneth Paltrow and announced that it would double its assets estimated at 11 million GBPs.
When 37-year-old Willoughby reported on the Instagram that he had left the trademark Truly, Jones was traveling from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source says: "Truly was far the most important thing for Holly.
That would be her long-term future, with which she would survive the next two decades.
Her decision to make an appointment was totally out of the question.
No one could believe what's going on in the Tuesday, because the opening was so close.
At the company’s seat in Marlow, the warehouse is full of goods prepared for sale.’
Experts believe that this morning's departure, which is among the most interesting links to banks in Britain, would make the company more than a million dollars for large investments in products, from glass and candles to clothing and accessories, and additional delays in opening.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were a good friend with Jones and his wife, Taro Capp for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly together with Cappo in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
Couples were relaxing together, and Jones has a 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a Ambassador of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as an ITV provider.
The source near Jonah said yesterday, "We will not comment on his business affairs."
Hard talk "and then we fell in love"
He spoke of the criticisms of the media because of comments that some consider to be "non-President" and a positive opinion on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump leave this way?
With his smiling “newist” voice, the trumpet said:
"I didn't leave anything."
He insisted that Kim showed interest in the second meeting. Their first meeting in Singapore in June marked Trump as a major step towards nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leader at the UN General Assembly meeting that North Korea does not see the "appropriate response" of the US to previous North Korean disarmament measures.
He argued that instead, the United States continues to impose sanctions on which the pressure continues.
The trumpet was rather optimistic in his contract.
"We're doing great in North Korea," he said.
"We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a good relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim brought positive results – stopped the rocket testing, helped free the tanks and brought home the remains of American soldiers.
He also took his unusual approach to talking about relations with Kim.
"It can be very presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this room full of sight, we have 200 people standing here," Trump said and pointed out to many directly before him.
The tsunamis and floods in Indonesia left the island, more than a hundred dead
In eradicating the effects of the earthquake in Lomboka, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations have been told that they do not need their assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lomboka's residents have been displaced, natural disasters have not been announced, which is a condition for international aid.
"In a number of cases, it was very clear that they did not require international assistance, so the situation was somewhat complicated," said Sumbong.
The Save the Children organisation consists of a team that will travel to Pala, but it is not yet clear whether foreign personnel can help on the ground.
Sutopa, the representative of the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials assess the situation in Palu and determine whether they will be allowed to help international agencies.
In view of the lack of natural resources in Indonesia, the state remains totally unprepared.
In the Acehu area, refuges were built by tsunamis, but on the other side, it is not often practice.
To the loss of life, it was likely that the apparent absence of a warning siren for the tsunamis in Palu, although it was effective.
Travel between numerous Indonesian islands also presents a challenge in the best of times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
The hospital ship, which is used to help victims of the earthquake in Lombok, is swimming against Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Vidodo put the improvement of the destroyed Indonesian infrastructure in front of his voluntary campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the financial deficit poses a problem for Jok's administration in re-election next year.
Joko is also faced with the pressure of long-term tensions between the sections of Indonesia, where the majority of Muslim members have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were evacuated from their homes because Christian and Muslim troops fought on the streets with swords, clubs, rifles, and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge's department for late exaggeration against Chelsea
On Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London, with the last of the 89 minutes, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea in 1st English league.
Sturridge accepted the gift of Herdana Shaqiri 25 metres before Chelsea's goal of leaving his team 1-0.
He threw it on his left and shot a gun at a remote gate.
The star traveled high above the criminal area against the right corner of the door.
She finally dropped through the door of Kepe Arrizabalage and fell into a hole.
"I've just tried to get to the right position for the jog and players, like Shaq, always draw it as much as I can, so I've tried to get as much time as I can," said Sturridge for LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw that Kante was coming, so after one touch, I didn't think enough and simply decided to shoot."
Chelsea led 1-0 in the afternoon with the back of Belgian player Edena Hazard in 25 minutes.
In this action, the attacker of the blues left Matthew Kovači and fled to Liverpool's half.
Kovačić placed it on the middle of the road and went on.
Then he passed through the defense, and Hazard fled into the prison.
Hazard crossed the defense and shot his left foot against the remote gate through Liverpool's door, Alison Becker.
Liverpool will meet with Naples on Wednesday at 15 a.m. at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea is waiting for Videoton in the League of Europe on Thursday at 15 a.m. in London.
The number of deaths of tsunami victims in Indonesia rose to 832
The number of deaths of torture and tsunamis in Indonesia rose to 832, and the state agency reported an accident on Sunday morning.
The representative of Sutopo Purwo Nugroh's agency told the press conference that there were many people due to a five-way collapse of 7.5, which opened six-metre waves trapped in the ruins of the building.
The palace, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is a trip to the ruins of the building.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man for murder after the woman was beaten to death.
The police launched a murder investigation after the woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyde this morning.
A 44-year-old with a broken wound was found at 7.55 in Grayson Mays building on John Street Street and was arrested for murder by 32-year-old man.
The police call on all those in the area who have seen or heard anything to make a statement.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the initial phase, but I call on all those who were near John Street Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard anything suspicious to get in touch with us.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on the tracks with the camera to get in touch with us, as they may have information that is of key importance to our investigation."
The police officer confirmed that she was a woman in Birkenhead, and the body was found inside the house.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the crime scene and asked where they found her in the morning.
Investigations are under way, and police inform their women.
The cab driver who lives in Grayson Mays just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one could enter or leave the building.
When he found out what happened, he was left with no words.
The representatives were now told that it could take more hours before they could come in again.
The police heard how he explained to the man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
There's a woman coming to the theater, all in the sun.
What continues to repeat "that's so terrible".
At 2:00 a.m., there were two police vans inside the corridor, and there was another one right outside it.
A number of police officers stood inside the corridor and observed a residential block.
All who have any information ask to write to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestopers company at number 0800 555 111 and indicate date 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's summit in Parliament has become the latest monumental target of the "re-writing of history" debate
Its removal would be a positive right to destroy a number of English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatic Puritanism.
However, the Cromwell Society has marked Crickov's proposal as "inspired" and "test of rewriting history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In today's debate on removal of chips, it has become clear that the like of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace will become a target."
The iconoclasts in the British Civil War Cromwell did not even order or execute orders.
Perhaps for the actions of his predecessor in the past century, Cromwell will be the victim of a mistake.
The great presentation of Cromwell, prepared by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is an opinion of the 19th century and is part of a history of personality that, according to some, is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwella numbers (maybe even more in the late 19th century than today) are seen as Parliament's guardian against external pressure, in his case of monarchy.
But it's a very precise presentation, it's the subject of some historical debate.
Clearly, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our people, and Cromwell is a recognized individual representing one side of this division.
His achievements from the time when Lord was a protector also deserve praise and mention."
A killer pig died of a Chinese farm until death
After reporting local media, the Chinese pig attacked and killed the farm on the market in the southwestern part of China.
The man who only identified him with the address “Yuan” was found dead with a fresh artery and a blood transfusion near a pig in the town of Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported on Sunday in the South China Morning Post.
The pig's river is prepared to sacrifice pigs on a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
After reporting with the brothers on Wednesday, she had to wait from nearby Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning a brother found him dead, and the door of the neighbor's pig was opened.
He said there was a big pigeon in the pigyard with a blood clot.
Forensic research has confirmed that a 250-kilogram-kilogram of dust was freezing the plants to death.
"Branch's legs were bleeding and wet," the brothers quoted with the title "Wu" in the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
The security cameras showed Yuang came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The man who attacked Yuan was neither his brother nor his brother.
The manager of the store told Evening News that the pigs were closed so he wouldn't attack anyone else while the police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market leadership should discuss the death penalty.
Although rare, cases of human pest attacks have already been reported.
In 2016 the pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, where men suffered severe physical damage.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilogram-kilogram dusted the walled farm with a tractor, but then the woman removed the animal.
After dogs ate a farm from Oregon in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a ‘swirl’.
"We'd just play.
They're like little children, very happy... they don't want to hurt you.
Just show them a sufficient measure of respect," he said.
In the south of the United States due to the remains of Organ Rosa, there is a strong rain
According to the report, Organ Rosa is moving against the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico and the weak.
But in the next few days, Rosa will bring water to the north of Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Rosa is from Sunday to 5:00 a.m., after sunrise, category 1 with wind speed 137 km/h and is 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenie in Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move to the north on Sunday.
While over the Pacific Ocean, the low-air pressure area moves east toward the western coast of the United States. Rosa will be approaching the mid-day of Baj California as a tropical storm and will push a high troupic wind against the north of the southern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the troupe, which will be mixed with the low pressure area, will create heavy flooding in the wider southwestern region in the future.
Locally, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, floods, and the possibility of earthquakes in the desert.
Due to high tropical rain levels, the number of floods in some cities will be about 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the south-west, especially above the larger part of Arizona, it is expected from 50 to 100 mm below.
Floods are possible due to rapid deterioration of the situation due to the widespread nature of tropical rain.
It would be very unwise to give a dog in the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can change cannons into the source of the river, and local winds and dust will soon be brought into the air.
The approaching low-air pressure area will bring local rainfall to the southern part of California.
It is possible to fall more than 12 mm, resulting in a lower drop of fuel and the side of the road.
This will be the first rain for the region in the rain period.
A few scattered tropical plains will begin to approach Arizona in Saturday late afternoon and Monday morning, late Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread over all sides of the sky on Tuesday, and it will also last in the middle.
In October, U.S. can reach large temperatures, as the Arctic is cold, and tropical winds remain too warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature in short distances.
The week is an excellent example of the dramatic differences in temperature in the average part of the United States.
Between Kanas City in Missouri and Omaho in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa are 20 degrees different.
In the next few days, summer temperatures will try to set and re-examine.
Most of the medium and eastern United States will enter the summer of October with temperatures around 27 °C from the Southern Plain region to the part of the north-east.
In New York we could have 27 °C in the Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good options for temperatures above the average of the U.S. east in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing of Bretta Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people have seen interesting fourth speech on six television networks by Bretta Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of a sexual assault to which it was due in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political battle continued, as television stations discontinued the regular program due to the five-minute shift: the agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, namely that the FBI will conduct a unilateral investigation of the charges.
The forum told the Justice Committee that it was 100% convinced that Kavanaugh had taken her in a guilty state and tried to take her to a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in the burning story that it was 100% sure it didn't happen.
Nielsen reports that on Friday, more than 20.4 million people would have seen the talk.
The company has average television viewing of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that were pre-supposed, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems with the protection of viewers who watch the programme in the offices.
For a simple presentation, the look is similar to that in the presentation of the final finish race or the award of the American Film Academy award.
Fox News Channel television, which leaders strongly support Kavanaugh's appointment, is leading to a full day hearing in front of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
On the other hand, ABC has 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million, 2.14 million NCBs and CNN 2.52 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
Interest is also high after hearing.
Flake had a central role in five dramas.
Following the announcement by the Office of the Measuring Republican to vote in front of Kavanugh, the CNN and CBS television cameras followed on Friday morning on how protestors called on him when he tried to enter the castle to participate in the hearing of the Justice Committee.
In the course of the construction, he linked the view of CNN's live cameras.
"I stand here before you," said a woman to him.
"Do you think he's telling the truth of the state?
You have the power, while many women are weak."
Flake said that his office had made a statement and added that he would give more attention to the hearing of the committee, and then the door was shut.
All television networks were also distributed in the living hours later when the Justice Committee voted in favour of the transfer of Kavanaugh's appointment to vote in the Senate.
But Flake said he would do so only if they agreed that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate, which the minority party called on in the next week.
Flakea, in this part, was convinced to speak with a friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators then, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was decided, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes to name Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump launched an investigation by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of "playing political games" in Brexit
The Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview on Sunday Times’s criticism of her plans for the European Union’s departure, accused the "playing political games" of the British future and of raising national interest.
British Prime Minister Therese May's arrival at the Berlin Conservative Party Conference in Britain on 29 September 2018.
In addition to another interview with her on the headline, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on her so-called Chequers Brexit Plan and said that it was a proposal for Britain and the EU to pay the other 'too absurd' fees.
Shooting on Wade Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected of killing an LSU team player
The police arrested the suspects in court shooting at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU team treasurer.
After reporting from Baron Rouge, the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison for a second-level murder charge.
Officials published a video of the encounter between Simms and Simpson and the police said that during the war, Sims lost his sunglasses.
The police found the sunglasses on the scene and on the Simpson's DNA, CBS television complements WAFB's TV reports.
After Simpson's hearing, the police announced that he admitted that he had shot Wade to death.
The security is $350,000, the lawyer's reporting.
A viewer from the East Baton Rouge Parish district issued a previous report on Friday stating that the cause of death is a bullet wound in the neck.
The police are grateful for assistance in the investigation leading to arrests for refugees from the Louisiana State Police, the criminal laboratory of the state police, the South University police and the residents of the area.
The sports director of the LSU team, Joe Alleva, thanked the local authorities for their "care and search for rights".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 201-centimeter attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played the LSU basketball game.
In the last season, 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps were collected in the middle.
On Friday morning, LSU trainer Will Wade said that the team was "pressed" and "in shock" because of Wade's death.
"That's what worries you all the time," said Wade.
Back to Mexico City
Pepel, who is the founder of the Popocatepetl volcano, has reached the southern vicinity of the mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexico not to approach the volcano on Saturday, as the activity in the crater was strengthened and 183 emissions of gas and dust were recorded in 24 hours.
The Center observed several cases of pregnancy and postpartum depression.
Images on social networks showed the tanks of the ashes covering the windmill glass of cars in the vicinity of the capital city Ciudad de Mexico, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysics have observed an increased activity in the volcano, which lies 72 kilometres south of the main city, after a 7.1-phase earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The Vulcan, called "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police in relation to Catalan separatists prior to the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the protesters, who supported independence, met with anti-surrogated police units, and thousands of people joined in fishing demonstrations marking the first anniversary of the catalytic polarized vote on withdrawal.
The group of masked supporters of separatist separatism, which were held by cross-border police units, was surrounded by eggs and metal paints in the dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded with tourists.
Later, there was also opposition, where police had to use pendants to stop the attacks.
Supporters of independence, who had been calling for more than an hour 'without forgetting, without giving up', met with protesters who support unity and shouted 'Let Spain live!'.
As local media reports, 40 people in the protests have been affected more easily.
The year after the referendum of 1 October, which was designated in Madrid as illegal, the Catalan separatists celebrated it, the tensions in the region supporting independence remain.
A large majority of voters voted for independence, even though the participation was low, as the opponents of the receipts in large measure rejected the elections.
Following the words of the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured, after the police tried to stop voting in violent conflicts in the region.
Groups supporting independence were scheduled to stop demonstrations and thus support the State police during the night.
The demonstrations continued, but they had to take another way.
68-year-old Narciss Termes, an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said there was no hope that Catalonia would be independent.
"Lani has experienced one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out for happiness because they could love, but now we are busy," he said.
Although it is important that, despite the close victory of the regional elections in the past December, the Catalan parties supporting independence have been heavily preserved this year, as the most well-known leaders in voluntary education or are waiting for trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a police-supported protest on the phone, explained that the protest had stirred politics on both sides.
"The tension is rising," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in detention since the end of the year before the beginning of the trial, announced that he will be candidate for elections in the European Parliament next year.
"Candidacy in European elections is the best way to punish the regression in the democratic values and the oppression we have seen in the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: arrested men flying into the house with the car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested because they had repeatedly flew into Londonderry.
The incident took place in the Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday about 19.30 after the British summer.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the door and the building were damaged.
At some point, they should also shoot the plane against the car.
With the west Mengaja, Livingston won from 1:0 against Ranges
Dolly Menga with his first round for Livingston gave a victory
Livingston defeated Rangers and Steven Gerard had to admit his second defeat in 18 games as a trainer from Ibrox.
Star Dolly Mengay took care of the difference, because Gary Holt's bridge was the same as the Hibernian bridge in another place.
Gerard's bridge is so unbeatable in the guests in the annual prime, and the next week, Hearts waits for them to lead on the boat and for which they remain behind eight points.
Before this, Rangers will visit Rapid Vienna team in the European Union on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston increased his degree of incompatibility in the division at six paces, and chief coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet experienced a seizure.
Livingston has made a chance against the direct guest.
The Holt team should be headed just before the west, as many problems have been caused by its direct approach to Rangers.
Scott Robinson got the door, but what he sent through the door, then Alan Lithgow hit outside the door, and Craig Halkett shot himself in the head.
The guests left the game Rangers because they knew they could be dangerous for guests when they stopped in the attack.
And in this way they also came to the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free shot, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared an action for Menga, who shot and stole from the middle of the prison.
The Rangers had more possession of the yokes, but domestic defenses couldn't survive and the door Liam Kelly didn't have much to do.
This pattern continued in the second half of the year, although Alfredo Morelos removed Kelly's defense.
Mr. Rangers' brother Allan McGregor shot Scott Pittman with his leg, and Lithgow shot him out of another Livingstone's crash.
The submissions continued to come to Livingstone's criminal scene, but the domestics refused all attacks, two of the attacks – Halket's breach over the replacement of Glenn Middleton and the violation of the game with his hand – and the judge did not get it.
‘Frequent Presentation’ Livingstone – Analysis
Lasmont (BBC Scotland) Alaska at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Great performance and result for Livingston.
It was clear that they were all great and still beyond expectations on their way up.
The number of games and events has not changed much since their return to the top, but Holt has to be credited for the way he woke up the team from his arrival.
There was a lot of Junakov.
Captain Halket had an extremely important role and well organized defense, while Menga had been preparing Connor Goldson and Joe Worrll.
The ranges, however, are simply a lack of hope.
Although Gerrard's leadership is exceptional, these standards are very low.
There was a lack of bullet on the floor – only once successfully overcome the host defense – and this is some building for Rangers, which was located in the middle of the forest.
Erdogan took the mixture in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met on the morning in Berlin, they took over the laughter and the blue sky.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to improve relations between Nata's allies.
There has been a debate on human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a large new museum.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish residents outside Turkey.
For security reasons, 25,000 heads of police prevented the collection before the bridge, but numerous supporters were able to come closer to see their president.
More than a hundred protesters, including many Kurds, have also expressed their opinion, who do not support the Government of Erdogan and have condemned Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to salute him in the country.
Contrary to the protests, some German Turks celebrate it as hero, while others prefer it as authoritarian.
An accident on the road in Deptford: the trainer died on the race with the car
In London, the driver died at a race where a car was involved.
An accident took place near the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a road in Deptford, southwest of the city, about 10.15 after the British summer.
The car driver stopped and rescuers arrived, but the man died at the end of the accident.
The accident took place just a few months after the trainer died in a race where the driver ran away on the Childers Street street, about 1.5 km from the Saturday accident.
The police have announced that the police are checking the identity of the man so they can inform their own.
They set up road arrests and moved bus lines, and they advised motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six guards injured in the train
Six prison guards were injured in an outbreak in a strictly protected male prison, reported from the prison administration.
Nered was released in the HMP Long Larsin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at about 9.30 a.m. after the British summer and still is running.
Police specialists from the "Tornado" unit were called to provide for a class where eight prisoners cooperate and are limited to one wing.
The monitors had less damage on the surface than they had at the end of their own lives.
The prison staff representative said: "We have called a specially trained staff who will provide for the release of the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members suffered damage.
In our prisons, we do not tolerate violence and it is clear that the police will be responsible for it and that they may be further for solutions."
In the HMP Long Lartin prison there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous perpetrators of criminal acts in the country.
In June, he was reported to be a prison manager in hospital care because he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October, an anti-circuit police unit was called into custody, which provided a heavy exit in which the personnel were attacked with billiard bells.
Orkan Rosa threatens Pheonixu, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (which may be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but this will probably happen at the beginning of the next week, as the remaining energy of the Rosa Organ is sinking through the south of the desert and bringing the danger of sudden floods.
The National Time Service has already issued a warning against the sudden floods of the West Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Orcan Rosa was supposed to get out of Phoenix on Tuesday, and he'll be up late on Monday with rain.
The National Time Service in Phoenix wrote in a tweet that only “ten tropical cycles have preserved the status of tropical storms or depression within 300 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
Orkan Katrina (1967) is a good 60 km from the Arizona border.’
The most recent models of the national centre for oranges provide 50 to 100 mm of cotton with individual cottons up to 150 mm on Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other areas of the south-west, including the Rockies and Great Basin areas, 25 to 50 mm can be expected to fall, each can fall to 100 mm.
For the area outside the danger of sudden floods, the rain of Organ Ross may be a blessing, as the region has been affected by drought.
Although the floods are very serious, some of the falls will probably be useful, since the dry season is currently taking place in the south.
"According to the U.S. drought monitoring centre, good 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least a severe drought," reports weather.com.
The source of the Rosa Orc is the first to lead to the capital of the Mechanical Hemisphere of Baja California.
Rosa, who still has the power of Orcan with the highest wind speed of 137 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenie in Mexico and moves north at 19 km per hour.
The weather comes in contact with colder waters in the Pacific and thus weakens.
It is expected that the land will reach Mexico with the power of tropical drought on Monday or evening.
The falls in parts of Mexico can be severe and therefore pose a serious threat to flood.
“From the Baj California to the north-east of Sonora we expect 75 to 150 mm of a flood with a possibility of 250 mm of a flood,” were reported on the site of weather.com.
Orcan Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of the Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then travel through Arizona and the South Utah until late in the Tuesday.
"The greatest danger we expect from Orcene Rosa or his remains is a severe drought in the half of Baja California in the north-west of Sonore and in the South-west of America," said the National Orcan Centre.
These floods can cause life-threatening sudden floods and floods in deserts and landfills in mountain regions.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three seniors and 20-year-old men were arrested for the sum of the attempted murder after they found 16-year-olds with their fists in Somerset.
The injured customer was found in the Excellence Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday, approximately 4.00 after the British summer time.
He was taken to the hospital, his condition remains “stable”.
17-year-olds, two 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested at night in Radstock's area, reported to the Avona and Somerset police.
The police are calling on everyone who's on the phone may have picked up the event to get in touch.
The trumpet said Kavanaugh was "long-lasting hostility and anger" by the Democratic Party
"The voice of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against intolerance and unheard of tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
The trumpet said that Kavanaugh was "long-lasting hostility and anger" by democratic parties in the process of its appointment.
Kavanaugh spoke before the convention on Thursday, where he clearly and emotionally ignored Christine Blasey Ford’s charges that he had been sexually assaulted ten years ago when they were the youngest.
At the hearing, Ford also spoke of his complaints.
The president said on Saturday that day "the Americans saw Kavanaugh's brightness, quality and enthusiasm".
"The vote to appoint Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to appoint one of the best legal concepts of our time, a lawyer with an exceptional record of public service," said many supporters in West Virginia.
The president directly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of voluntary participation of Republicans in interlocutors.
"For five more weeks to one of the most important desires of our lives.
I really work with the candidate," he said.
"That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
The trumpet claims that Democrats are on the mission "to stop and stop".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh was to take place at the latest on Friday, told CNN the councillor of the Republican Party.
In the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami of more than a hundred people, the number of victims is growing.
The authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed in the earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
More than a hundred people gathered on Friday at the festival on the beach in the city of Pala, when six - foot - long [5 m] waves hit the coast and carried a number of people to death and destroyed everything on their way.
Cunami was following a 7.5-degree strike.
"When tsunamis were threatened yesterday, people left on the beach and did not immediately escape, so they became victims," said the representative of the Indonesian agency at the meeting in Jakarta to alleviate the disaster BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
"Cunami didn't come with me, he drove cars, trees, houses, everything on the ground," he explained to Nugro and added that he traveled through the open sea at 800 km/h before he hit the coast.
He said some people went down to the trees to escape the tsunami and survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Paluja.
Air photographs published by the accident agency indicate destroyed buildings and shops, wires and damaged bridges and bridges, and water-borne bridges.
In Saturday, post-secondary suns continued to penetrate the coastal area.
In an area of 2.4 million people have experienced some sort of stress.
The Indonesian Agency for Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released in a five-fifty power explosion was about 200 times more than the nuclear bomb power in Hiroshima in the second world war.
The geography of the cities, which lies at the end of the long and hard seas, would increase the size of tsunamis.
Nugroho described the damage as “overload” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims found refuge under the ruins of buildings, and he added that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho explained that the victims and the damage may be greater than two hundred km north of Palu, in the area of Dodrea, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
As Nugro said, communications have been completely interrupted and have no information from the Dongry area.
"More than 300,000 people live in the area," said the Red Cross statement, adding that staff and volunteers are being sent to affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can become even worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency received a number of criticisms, since the public did not announce that the tsunamis attacked Pala, but officials say the waves came right at the time of the release of the warning.
At the amateur video published on social networks, it is heard that men at the top of the platform shout a warning of people on the street at nearby peaks.
Within a few minutes, the water wall ran along the coast and carried the building and the car with it.
Reuters could not immediately verify the validity of the monitoring.
Posts and tsunamis have resulted in an explosion of electricity that has halted communication around Paluja, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The authorities report that the army has started sending cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but refugees still need food and other basic necessities.
The city airport was open only to provide assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo should visit the evacuation centres in Paluy on Sunday.
The number of victims in the Indonesian tsunami grew to over 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Doseb, the members of the World Vision organization from Dondree had safely arrived in Pala, where employees at the court were stationed in front of their premises, but on the way they saw a number of exhibitions of relaxation.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with great experience would not be allowed to come to Pala.
In accordance with the Indonesian regulations, cross-border financing, deposits and assistance of persons are permitted only if the city is declared an accident for the national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still being treated as an accident at the provincial level," said Aulia Ariani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'all right, this is a national accident', we can accept international assistance, but this status is not yet.'
The second night after Friday's riot and tsunami in Palu, friends and friends of the missing hope that their nearby miracles are in tragic stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was picked up from the canal.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been beaten for two days under the debris, and her mother's body was lying there.
Gendon Subbandon, a trainer of the Indonesian nuclear power plant, trained two sets of Asian nuclear ballasts that ended at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
The other, trapped in Roa Roa's hotel, were his students after Mr. Mandija's words.
"As an elder in the field of nuclear disaster, I carry my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how in the hours when the news of the destruction of Roa Roa's hotel passed through the community of nuclear bombers, he sent messages to the WhatsApp app to the Paluja contestants who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages were marked with only one blue key, instead of two blues.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Dads stole $26,750 while filling banks in the center of Newport on the Level
After reporting from Newport police, the dads stole 26,750 USD from Brink’s security service on Friday morning, which filled the banknotes in the centre of Newport on the Leeve.
The driver of the car emptyed the bankate in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in a public statement.
While he was employed, another man “proceeded to the Brink’s secure service from the back” and stole the cash for delivery.
After the report, the witnesses saw several suspects fled from the scene, but the police did not specify the exact number of participants in the event.
All who have information on the identity of suspects should call the Newport police on numbers 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: raper changed his name in Ye
Raper Kanye West changed his name – in Ye.
The amendment was sent to Twitter on Saturday and wrote: «Bitja with the official name Kanye West».
The 41-year-old West has the task of Ye for some time and has also used it for the title of his eight album, which was released in June.
The change comes right before his appearance in the Saturday Night Live show, in which to present his new Yandhi album.
He will replace the poor Ariano grando, who rejected the rise for "special reasons", the author of the award said.
The word is abbreviation of his current professional name, and the West has already said that the word has religious significance.
"I think 'yes' is the most frequently used word in the Bible, meaning 'you' (sl. ti),' said West at the beginning of this year when he spoke to the radio host Big Boye about the title of the album.
"So I'm you and I'm all mine.
Kanye, which means "one", I changed in Ye – it reflects our good, our bad, our mistake, everything.
The album is a reflection of everything we are."
Kanye is one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was named Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed a wish for the names Love and Brother Love.
The former West's associate, JAY-Z, also used his name differently; with an idea or without it, and with great tricks.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use military forces against civilians
The newly elected Mexican president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, swore that he would never use military forces against civilians, just as the state nears the 50th anniversary of the violence against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza market that "he will never use the army to arrest the Mexican people."
When a left-wing student movement began to operate in Latin America, on October 2, 1968, the military started shooting and killing 300 people at peaceful demonstrations.
Lopez Obrador vowed to support young Mexicans and students to provide monthly subsidies and open several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of access to education lead young people to criminal society.
The United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the resources used for research in this area, the real investor and the expert on artistic intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after various parts of the American government have announced the use of artificial intelligence, although the United States does not have an official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China has presented its plan: their goal is to become the best in innovation in the field of art intelligence by 2030.
"Seconding the budget for the research of art intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are very much for the US and we are looking for the next deal in the field of art intelligence," Lee said.
The duplication of funding could double the possibility that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence would take place in the United States, Lee told the CNBC during the interview this week.
Lee, Czech book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (Supersle Art Intelligence: China, Siliciva Dolina and New World Order) was published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, the president of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most visible arts intelligence companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University developed a system of art intelligence that won the highest rank of the American game player Othello, and later was executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Googla Association.
Lee said he was familiar with the former American government's technological competitions, such as the competition in robotics organized by the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) and asked when next time he would find the next audiences.
Researchers in the United States must work hard if they want to receive state support, Lee said.
"Not China's one who takes the best academics, but it's companies," Lee explained.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been working best from the university in recent years to develop art intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think we should offer a green card to a doctor from art intelligence automatically," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council issued a development plan for the arts intelligence of the new generation.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences finances people in academic institutions, like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations divide money into American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is weaker, explained Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the US Ministry of Defence established the Joint Institute for Art Intelligence, which combines partners from the industrial and academic sectors, and the White House announced the establishment of a warm committee for Art Intelligence.
This month, the DARPA agency announced an investment in the AI Next initiative of two billion dollars.
National Science Foundation (NSF) currently accounts for more than $100 million per year in the research of artificial intelligence.
While the American legislation she wanted to create the National Security Commission for Art Intelligence, she did nothing for months.
Macedonians will decide at the referendum to change the name of the country
Macedonian citizens voted on Sunday at the referendum whether their countries would change their names in the 'Northern Republic of Macedonia', thereby resolving the ten-year dispute with Greece that challenged their application for membership in the European Union and Natou.
Greece, which has its province on behalf of Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbours represents the right to their territory and has introduced a veto to its entry into Nato and the EU.
On the basis of the proposed new name, the governments have agreed in June, but nationalist opposers claim that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority of Macedonians.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote on the referendum, but the campaign of the Boycott expressed doubts that the participation would be at least 50 per cent, as long as it was necessary to apply the referendum.
The question on the referendum list was, ‘Are you a member of the NATO and the EU with the agreement with Greece?’
Supporters of the referendum, including the President of the Government of Zoran Zaev, claim that this is the price that is worth being paid for joining bodies such as the EU and Nato, for Macedonia, one of the countries that came after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
Today I have come to vote for the future of the country and for young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely within the framework of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament acted to respect the outcome of the vote that would be decided.
The change in names requires a double majority in Parliament.
The National Voluntary Commission has announced that no irregularities have been reported by 13 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I have come to love for my children, our city is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a bishop of the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian President Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško, gave their votes to the referendum in Macedonia on 30 September 2018 on the change in the name of the country that would open the way to the accession of Natu and the European Union.
Before parliaments in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small table or set up a table before the guards who set up those who would vote for the referendum.
"We are for Nato and the EU, but we want to join the lifting heads, not through the last door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we do not want to be accepted as Macedonia, we can turn to others, for example China and Russia, and become part of the European integration."
The President of the Zaev government says that the NATO membership will make a significant investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that there will be a large majority because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and Nato," Zaev said after giving his favorite list.
He added that it would be a positive result of the "intention of our future".
The survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday showed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, which is less than the required voluntary participation.
A second survey conducted by the Macedonian television Telma showed that 57 per cent of the respondents would like Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent would vote for them.
In order to make the referendum a success, the voluntary participation must be 50 % plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would mean the first real hit on the policy of the Western Government, which took over the mandate of May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City has won the entire Bridgeton defense and defense.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling are playing Brighton's defense at Manchester City from 2 to 0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester in England.
Aguero's crew in 65 minutes was seen funnyly simple.
Argentinian attacker accepted the mid-game input at the beginning of the action.
He walked between three Brighton's defense players and found an open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green players.
He won one of the defense players and was faster than others on Brighton's scene.
Then he put Sterling on his left.
The English attacker, with his first touch in the criminal space, returned to the corner of Aguera, who was defeated by Brighton's porter Matthew Ryan and sent the hole to the right side of the network.
"Aguero copes with problems in the legs," said the coach of Pep Guardiola.
"We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he got naked at that moment."
But Sterling was the one who gave the blue blue blue the initial advantage in the first English league.
Gol arrived in 29 minutes.
In this action, Aguero took his deep breath at the Brighton's half.
He gave Leroy to Sane on the left.
Sane once touched the hole, then sent a hole to Sterling against the remote gate.
The blue attacker was putting a hole in the net just before she flew out of the hole.
The city will meet with Hoffenheim on Tuesday, 12.55 at the Rhine-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany, in the League's first group.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies and destroy them for the title
The Nationals team has finally emerged, so there is no special reason for a new attack.
But always the competition Scherzer hopes that on Sunday he will be able to join the Greeks against the Colorado Rockies team. This will happen only if Rockies still have the opportunity to play in the end, because they have a favorite game in the West League in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers team.
Rockies won 5:2 on the Nationals team at least invited organizers on Friday, but still wait for their first title in the division.
"Although we can't get anything, at least we will be able to play in a great mood before a large crowd here in Denver and the opposite team will play at the most likely level this year.
So why don't you want to compete?"
Nationals have not yet published the names of the first metalr for the week, but it is likely that in this case, it will be the metal Scherzer.
Scherzer, who will be the first to have 34 years of metal, is a fourth metal as a cheerleader and would have had enough days of rest by week.
Washington's right hand has collected this season 18 dragons and 7 shots with an average of 2,53 and 300 shot-outs in 220 2/3 shifts this season.
Camps in West Virginia
The President directly affected the situation with regard to his election to the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugh, when he spoke of the importance of Republican voluntary participation in interlocutory elections.
"Everything we've done will be on the couch in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
This will be one of the biggest – I really work with the candidate, so I fight for great candidates everywhere," he said.
The trumpet continued: "We have this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, and this is happening right now.
They are determined to re-examine the area in which they will use all possible means. You can see shame, shame.
They have all the power and authority to do so, and they want power and control, but we will not give them it."
According to his words, democracies are on the mission of "repression and arrest".
"And you may have observed this in the last four days," he said, and Democrats marked it as a "bad, bad, low- and lying".
He presented a member of the Justice Committee, democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, with a voice of disapproval from the town.
"Remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, I'm not, wait. It was a really bad talk of the body, the worst thing I've ever seen."
The lab party is no longer open to different views.
To those who express their views is impatient.
When Momentum's activist in my local page told me no doubt, it wasn't a surprise.
Finally, I am the last of the members of Parliament from the Laburist Party, whom we do not wish to express my opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, had a similar experience because she was firmly involved in anti-Semitism.
In my case, it went on to propose a mystery for my disagreement with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy has not agreed with previous leaders.
In the notification for the fifth meeting of the Nottingham East, the Laburist Party wrote that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In eight years, as a member of the local parliament of the laboratory, the five meetings were most precisely like that.
In most meetings today, regret is not applied to such a tone and the promise of a 'closer and milder' policy is long forgotten if it actually started.
It is becoming more and more evident that different views on the labyrinth are not available and is judged in each opinion as to whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
This began soon after Jeremy became a leader, and my colleagues, whom I had previously thought to share similar political views, were expecting me to change my opinion and take a position that I would never agree with – to do so in the area of national security or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly – and, in fact, it is not important to say what I say – that the criticisms on social networks that call for non-election are critical of the media policy and that they tell me not to be in the labyrinth.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I have more happiness than some of my colleagues, because the comments, to me, are only political.
I admire the expertise and determination of those colleagues who meet daily with the flood of sexist or racist jokes, but they are not afraid.
One of the most sadistic aspects of this period of policy is how the level of abuse has become very common.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that a labist party must promote a culture of tolerance.
However, the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions, and with every proposal of uncertainty or amendment to the rules for the choice of the party becomes more transparent.
In the last two years, I have received much advice to turn my head off and not to be so loud, and it will be ‘all right’ with me.
But I didn't get involved in politics because of that.
Since I joined a labist party 32 years ago, which was the cause of Tatcher's government's low-fashionedness, which made my primary school teacher deliberately disintegrated, I have tried as a local priest or government minister to take better public services for those who need them most.
I've never hidden my political convictions, including recent elections.
No one on the Nottingham East could be confused by my political positions and areas on which I did not agree with the current leadership.
To those who have supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that I do not understand their wishes after spending time and energy to discuss my loyalty to the leader of the labist party at the time when the state is going to fight the brexit that will affect households, businesses and our public services.
But my right message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters and voters, whether or not they are members of the Laburist Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that no threat to the non-selective or political complicity will turn me away from it in order to act in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38:17 Melrose: Unprepared Ayr on top of the wood
Two well - known experiments have failed several final results, but there is no doubt that Ayr has earned the victory in this wonderful first-time game of days.
Now they're on the top of the ship and they're the only unarmed team of ten.
Finally, the weight on the home side exceeded their top defense and better use of the opportunity and trainer Peter Murchie had a good reason for satisfaction.
"We have stopped a lot of trials in our current stages and are still unsatisfied, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "Happy Ayra team, the opportunities have been used better than we have."
Grant Anderson, a 14-minute prisoner who was transformed by Frazier Climo, led by Ayr, but a Romanian cardboard for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who took him into the Warriors game, referred to a number of violence for Melrose and Jason Baggott went through an attempt without conversion.
The climate has increased the leadership for Ayr, before it was right in the spring and then turned itself into a self-test for the result 17:5 for Ayr for the winter.
However, Melrose began a very good second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt to convert Baggot reduced the remainder to five points.
She followed a long interruption due to the serious injury of Ruaridha Knott, which had been carried on the carriages, and Ayr continued with the trial of Stafford McDowall, who turned him into Climo.
Temporary Captain Ayra Blair MacPherspon then received a Romanian card and Melrose again used the game with the player more with an unrecognizable experiment by Bruce Colvine at the end of the period of violent pressure.
But the guests returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a Romanian card for blocking the climate without the noise, MacPherson was attacked by the attack.
Climo reached the point after Kyle Rowe shot David Armstrong and sent a winged player, Gregor Henry, in five attempting guests.
Still Game Series Star is starting a new career in the guest
The star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series is obviously given in the guesthouse, rather than becoming the director of the licensed company with restaurants.
56-year-old in a favorite BBC series for which he also wrote a scenario, the game of Jack Jarvis with a long-term partner in the comedy of Greg Hemphill.
Two reported that after the next nine seasons, Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Crigang.
In the light of the official documentation, the Director of the Company Agymorn Limited is the Director of the Company.
The player did not want to comment on the story, but the source for the Scottish Sun insisted that Kiernan would want to be involved in the "circulatory hospitality" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
The sailors patrol the seabed in La Paz.
At public buildings, the sea blue flag has been removed.
The coastal bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with the slogan: "We have the right to the sea.
Our duty is to return it."
In Celin Bolivia, the memory of the loss of the coast in the bloody conflict is still alive because of natural resources with Chile in the 19th century – such as the recovery after the invasion of the Pacific.
This hope is perhaps the biggest in decades now, as Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be delivered after five years of consultation on 1 October.
"Bolivia has a desire, a spirit of unity and impartiality, and of course in a positive spirit awaits the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
A number of Bolivians will look at the decision of the International Court of Justice at large posts across the country and trust that the Hague Court will decide in front of Bolivia, which will be held – after decades of inconsistencies – to negotiate on Bolivia's access to sovereign access to the sea.
Here Morales, the Bolivian charismatic domestic president, who is waiting for a controversial re-election battle next year, has also had a lot of expectations about Sunday court.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will not decide in front of Bolivia – and if so, it would not have changed much.
The UN body, with its seat in the Netherlands, has not authorized Bolivia to assign a coastal area and will not decide on the outcome of the possible talks.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice is only six months after the final arguments have been heard means that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zarate, an expert on international law.
And in the last four years they don't speak in front of Bolivia, but maybe they'll have a lot to do with it.
"The current Bolivian government has used the question of access to the sea," Zarateev said.
Morales' aggressive retourage from Chile has made all the good wishes that may have remained clear.
The talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to participate in the discussions.
The States have not changed the Ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, Bolivian representative in Haagu, rejected the idea that the court had decided immediately.
On Monday, Bolivia will provide "extraordinary opportunity for a new period of relations with Chile" and the possibility to "end of 139-year differences with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also missed that Morales – still one of the most popular Latin American presidents – used the sea issue as a political weapon.
"Bolivia will never deny its rights to access to the Pacific," he added.
‘The decision is an opportunity to make sure that we have to overcome the past.’
North Korea stated that nuclear disarmament would not happen if it could not trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people will never destroy their nuclear weapons first if they can't trust Washington.
Ri had a talk on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
The United States invited them to fulfil their commitments made at a meeting between the leaders of the fishing countries in Singapore.
His statement is coming at the time when American Minister Mike Pompey was clearly in front of the reinstatement of nuclear diplomacy, which was at the point of death, more than three months after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Unom in Singapore.
Ri says that the United States is wrong if they think that the continuation of sanctions and the contract would have led to the end of the Korean war in North Korea.
Washington is aware of the allegations, without having first taken decisive measures for disarmament in Pyongyang.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, it is generally disputed that Pjongjang thinks seriously about the refusal of a weapon that the State sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pjongjanga next month to prepare everything for the second meeting of Kima and Trump.
On fashion magazines in Paris, the latest line of large envelopes coming to trade with price marks in your neighborhood
If you want to fill your collection with cover or hide before the sun, you don't need to keep looking.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne, in their youth collections and summer 2019, discovered a collection of amazingly large coverings that concealed the floor in Paris’s weekly fashion.
It was very ineffective to cover it during the summer of Instagram, and the designer sent his spectacular creations to the fashion gun.
Valentin's hair, which was the most prized, was a non-coloured hat with wide edges decorated with a pen with similar additions, in which the heads of models were completely lost.
The second large blue supplements included the rubies with precious stones, magic knobs and even pineapples – but your heads will not burn.
Thom Browne also showed the choice of strange masks – exactly the right time for the night of the witch.
A lot of colorful masks have lips covered and are more like Hannibal Lecter masks than high fashions.
One creature was similar to the equipment for filling with the diode and the eye, while the other was seen as a cornet with a leveled ice cream.
And if you want to follow fashions, you're lucky.
The fashion designers predict that grand coverage will be coming to the store near you.
The broad clasps are closely following "La Bombi", a slamming rock with 60-centimetre edges were observed on Rihanni and Emily Rattakowski.
A cult mark for an extremely ineffective knot, which passed through the social network, sent another great creation by the fashion bridge – a broken beach bag that was almost as big as a maniac in the shoes she wore.
A cup of coffee in a refined orange colour, dressed with the risks of coffee and with a hand from white lips, was the central hair of the La Rivera collection for youth/sense 2019.
The famous Luke Armitage stylist told the FC: "I expect large beach caps and bags to be brought into the market for the next year – because the manufacturer made such a powerful strain, the demand for too much extra would be difficult to overcome."
John Edward: Language knowledge is a key factor for global citizens
The Scottish Schools themselves enjoy the words of academic excellence, and this also continued in 2018 with the same set of outstanding results on exams, which still strengthen individual and collective achievements in sports, art, music and other endeavors of the communities.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Schools Council (SCIS) are trying to provide the highest level of service for their students and their parents.
Schools themselves want to prepare their students for further and higher education, chosen a career course and a place that they have as global citizens.
As the education sector, which can form and implement an adjusted school programme, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language that he understands, the conversation will be interesting.
But if you talk to a man in his mother tongue, his words will touch his heart.’
This is a good reminder that we must not rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The annual results of recent surveys show that languages at the top of the school are at the highest levels of success in private schools.
68 percent of the students who have learned foreign language have reached an excellent estimate.
The data collected in the 74 schools of the Scottish Council of Schools for Schools (SCIS) showed that 72% of the students reached a high level in Mandarin and 72% of the German students, 69% in French and 63% in Spanish.
This proves that schools alone in Scotland support foreign languages as key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as an object of choice in the educational plans of schools and others are treated as objects in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
A 2014 study carried out by the Commission on Employment and Training of the United Kingdom showed that it could, for reasons where workers are persecuted to fill free jobs, be subject to 17 per cent lack of knowledge of languages.
Therefore, knowledge of languages is becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future career.
In the future job opportunities that require language learning, these skills are of major importance in the world.
If someone learns another language, there is a great advantage in the future regardless of the professional course he has chosen, with such experience.
A majority of people who can deal directly with people from foreign countries have an independent advantage in the face of competition.
The 2013 YouGov survey involving more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom showed that 75 percent of people did not speak a foreign language well enough to speak, with French being the only language spoken by the two-thirds of the respondents, that is 15 percent.
It is therefore important for today’s children to invest in learning the language.
By learning more languages, especially those from developing countries, children have a better chance of finding suitable employment.
Schools vary in language taught in Scotland.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others learn languages that will be the most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, you will always be able to choose a number of languages taught by experts in this field at school.
Schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will equip children and equip them with the knowledge they need for success regardless of what the future holds.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country, so this must also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be treated as 'International Communication Skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You need to do it.

LeBron will be debitiated on Sunday in San Diego in Lakersov
For lovers who rejoice in LeBron James' first appearance of the Los Angeles Lakers Museum, the waiting will soon be over.
Trainer Lakers Luke Walton announced that James will play in a Sunday's leading game, chaired by the Daver Nuggets Museum in San Diego.
He doesn't know how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one and less than 48," explained Walton on the official website of Lakers.
The official reporter of the Lakers team Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James asked about his plans for Lakers' six courses before the season.
"At this stage, I do not need a race before the season," he said.
crowding in West Virginia on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump today in Wheeling in West Virginia starts a series of events in his campaign.
This is the first of the five planned meetings in the following week, including the arrivals in the affected countries, between the other Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since his candidate for a simple seat at the Supreme Court has not yet been confirmed, Trump wants to receive support for incoming interlocutory elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump's meeting be in West Virginia and where will you be able to watch it online?
The assembly in Wheeling in West Virginia will be held on Saturday, 29 September 2018 at 9 a.m. after sunrise.
You can watch a drum gathering in West Virginia live online on YouTube channel.
Trump will probably talk about hearings of candidates for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh this week, which has become tense because of complaints about sexual harassment, which is why the signature in the Senate is expected to be postponed for one week to conduct an investigation by the FBI.
However, the primary objective of this meeting is to help the Republicans, who are awaiting important elections in November, to gain a new start.
Therefore, in the campaign of President Trupa, these five meetings were meant "to encourage volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority of those in the Senate and the House of Representatives, Reuters reports.
"The monitoring at the Congress is so important for his programme that the president of the campaign will travel to as many countries as possible," said the representative of the Trump campaign, who does not want to be nominated.
Today's gathering in the centre of Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could also be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania after reporting the West Virginia MetroNews radio.
In Saturday, Trump will be visiting West Virginia for the second time in the last month, where he received more than 40 percent of the point in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a Republican candidate for a Senate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in public research.
"For Morrisey, it is a weak sign that the president must come and "take him" in public research," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University in West Virginia after the Reuters report.
Ryderev's 2018 prize: US team has a desire to win and keep hope before the week's private battles
After three unilateral games, there may have been a Sunday afternoon of two (foursomes) what Ryder's annual kiss needed.
It's not like it's always a sport concept, but players really believe it out there, especially on such competitions.
So where'd it go now?
"They had six points of advantage, and now they have four, so this is probably a new start for us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, because it leads to four points, and it can still have twelve points.
But after Spieth's words, the Americans feel that they have wind in the yards, and among other things, they are encouraged by the form of Spietha and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each won three points from four.
Spieth was condemned from the beginning to the green and gives a good example.
The cracks of luck continued to become more loud and led to a decisive hit when Thomas and his two-point match was completed in the fourth game.
The hit that gave them victory on 15th of July was a similar scream, which lets you know that we believe that the American team still has the opportunity.
"You just need to find your inner power and focus on your game," said Spieth.
That's all that's left for this player now.
18 laureate to glory.
The only player with more points than Spieth and Thomas have in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the incredible story of Ryder's kiss.
It is unusual, but the overwhelming two Europeans have won four points from four and are not wrong.
The two ‘Mollywood’ were the only one who did not hit the budget on Saturday afternoon, and the budget was also avoided in Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and at the last nine o’clock in the morning.
Such a game and a way in which the energy gap between them and the botanical population is evident is confirmed by the fact that these are the players that will have to overcome it on Sunday, and no other player would be better able to secure the potential victory of Europe than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes over the Le Golf National.
Well, as far as possible, both of them are on different angles.
But talking about European glory would be a shame.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcio, the morning hero in the game with four jogs, who were in a couple with Alex Noren.
Because of the bungies and two double bungies on the first nine lons, Spain and Sweden fell into a crisis where they did not find their way out.
But on Saturday, players won't have any help.
The games with four joggs and two pairs of two are extremely interesting to monitor closely the communication between couples, the advice they give them, the advice they do not give, and the way in which the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has so far played better than the team and has a great advantage before the last day, but the two of them have shown that the U.S. team also wants to win, some of which, especially on the American side, have doubled.
Europe runs 10:6 before the last day of Ryder's wedding
Europe's final day of Ryder's wedding will be a good priority after the Saturday games with four joggs and two two waters of 10:6 against the United States.
The excellent couple who make up Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari gave each of them all and with two victories over Tiger Woods and the Le Golf National scored four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to win the trophie lost two years ago in Hazeltin, had in the morning games with four jogs over the American team that made a mistake and mentioned below 3:1.
The U.S. team got better involved in two fights where they won two games, but the rest couldn't win.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from the 12 weekly separate battles if they want to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first European journalist who won four consecutive points while with Molinari (a couple called Molliwood) after the sedentary end of the week only another couple who won four points in their first four games in Ryder's story.
After winning over Woods and Patrick Reed in the game with four joggs, they again appeared and more likely to win the spent Woods and American newspaper Bryson Dechambeau with 5 and 4.
Woods, who drove through two games on Saturday, showed his curiosity at the moment, but he lost 19 out of 29 games in two games with four balls and two pairs of two, from this seven sequence.
Justin Rose, who had been resting for the morning game with the four joggs, returned for two and a couple with Henrik Stanson with two and a 1 battle with Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopko, who were assigned to the first and third place on the world ship.
However, on a friendly, winding day in the south-west part of Paris, it did not go all the way to the plans of the European team.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new criterion for Americans on Saturday with two points.
With 2 and 1 they won a decisive victory against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Jan Poulter in the game with the four corners and later returned and defeated Poulter and Rory McIllroy with 4 and 3 in two, with the first two holes lost.
Only once in Ryder's story did the team come back after the remainder of the four points before the private battle, although Fury's team needs only exaggeration to protect the trophie.
But after two days on the other side of the road, the weekly assault may seem too much for her.
North Korea: "Without confidence we will never be united"
In Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations that the continued implementation of sanctions would lead to growing distrust in the United States of America and that North Korea would certainly not give up its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
At the annual meeting of the General Assembly of this world authority, Ri Jong Ho said that in the past year, North Korea has adopted a number of 'important measures in the mark of good will' such as the cessation of nuclear and rocket tests, support for nuclear testing and promise not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see the proper response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, we will not be confident in state security and under such conditions we will never be able to break down first."
While Ri repeated known allegations of resistance to Washington to the progressive approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded for the adoption of procedural measures, his statement was important because it did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as in the past did Pjongng.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jung Una and Donald Trumpa from the first summit between the current president of the United States and the North Korean leader who took place on 12 June in Singapore. At that time Kim committed himself to work for the "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", while the North Korean Tromp promised security.
North Korea wants the official end of the Korean war, which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has acted that Pyongyang must first abandon nuclear weapons.
Washington also did not give up the call to release the strict international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
"The U.S. maintains that we must first put nuclear weapons on hold, and push pressure on sanctions to achieve their goals by force, and even the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"When we think that sanctions can bring us to knees, it is for the unrealistic hope of people who don't even know us.
The problem is that the continued implementation of sanctions still deepens our uncertainty."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trumpo, which was presented by the president of the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
On the contrary, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kimm and South Korean President Mun Jje Inom, who took place in the past five months, adding: "If we had talked to South Korea and not the United States about nuclear disarmament, we would not have agreed on such a dead spot."
However, the tone of Rijega's speech was quite different from that when the General Assembly of the United Nations said that the attack on the US cell part with North Korean rockets was inevitable, after "Mr. Bad President" Trump Kim identified "the rocket man" on the suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, commended Kima and his courage in taking the disarmament measures, but said that he was still waiting for much more work and that the sanctions must remain valid until North Korea is nuclearly armed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that there was no time frame for this, and he said: ‘It may last two years, three years or five months – that is not important.’
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
Nevertheless, in the fourth US Secretary of State, Mike Pompey told the UN Security Council: "The imposition of the Security Council sanctions must continue decisively without exception until we recognize the complete, complete and verifiable state of nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has adopted additional sanctions for North Korea in order to prevent the financing of North Korean nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
Pompey met with Rij, a servant of the General Assembly of the United Nations, and later said that Pyongyang would return to visit next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompey has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not ended well.
When he left Pjongjang in July, he said that he had made progress, and North Korea had criticised him a few hours ago, so that his demands would be "gangster".
North Korea committed itself to the meeting with Mun, which took place this month, to become a rocket test and a nuclear test infrastructure if the United States took ‘appropriate measures’.
Kim should say that ‘appropriate measures’ have been considered a security guarantee agreed by Trump in Singapore and measures to normalise relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard University visit a course to learn how to take enough time to rest
The goal of the new annual course at Harvard University is to teach all secondary students how to get more sleep. With this course, they want to fight against the growing artistic culture of "cellontic" learning, where powers are collected with caffeine.
A university professor found that students of the world's best universities often do not know the basis for their own concerns.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham Women's Hospital, has formed a course that is one of his first types in the United States.
In order to implement such a course, he decided after his teaching on the impact of the lack of flexibility on learning.
At the end of the class, a girl approached him and said, "Why do I do this only now when I'm in the last year?"
She said that no one told her how important the Spanish was, and for the newspaper The Daily Telegraph, the professor said it surprised him.
The course that they are conducting this year talks about the key importance of good sleep habits for study and sport as well as for improving the overall feeling of good.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the Executive Director of the University of Health Services, says that they have decided on such a course when they have found that the student is missing significantly during the week.
The enourn course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of the student’s home door where students can click on coffee bags, candles, sports shoes and books to obtain information about the influence of caffeine and light, the impact of lack of tension on sports success and the importance of sleeping routines.
However, in the second section, participants have concluded that long-term lack of spasms may increase the risk of heart failure, stroke, depression and cancer.
The field of student settlements with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are called that the conduct of students will not change immediately.
And we think that they have the right to know the facts, just as they have the right to know how smoking affects their health," adds Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that pride culture is still present with the "lived lifelong learning". It also adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students, as a result of the lack of Spanish, poses a growing problem.
Professor Czeisler says that enough quality spasms should be a "secret weapon" for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety. They can also avoid getting harder – brains because of lack of spasms are being easily passed, which makes students easy to deal with.
A 19-year-old California student of the chemical and physical biology Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler develop a course. Lani participated in a professor's lecture at Harvard during his first year.
He says that giving opened his eyes and encouraged him to pursue a course throughout the student community.
It is hoped that in the next phase, students will be able to ask for a similar study programme to be completed before they are enrolled in a competition institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students continue to wake up to sleep and also to wake up. He also wants to warn them of the harmful effects of the "moderate light" that are transmitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, as they can cause imbalances in the circadian rhythm, which makes it difficult to sleep.
Livingston : Rangers = 1 : 0 Mega mega with the back of the top of Gerard's team
Rangers re-examined in guests: Dolly Menga in Livingstone declared team Steven Gerrard condemned defeat with 1 :0.
The team from Ibroxa has won its first guest victory after February's ruling at the St. Johnstone Stadium with 4 : 1, but the team Gary Holt has won a second defeat in 18 matches since it is headed by the team Gerarrd, with his team leading the Scottish league team remaining 8 points.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the first half of his life, and the selected type of Rangers didn't give the impression that he wanted to get rid of it.
With this, Rangers fell to a common place and Livingston advanced to a third place, but with different heads left the Hibernian team.
The problem with Rangers has not been over yet. Calum Spence, a foreign judge, suffered head injuries when he was reported by the pilot from the city of the visiting team.
Gerrard was in a crew that won the Ayr victory without trouble and was ranked in the semifinals of Betfred Cup, making eight changes.
On the other hand, Holt kept a check on Livingstone's esoteric, which took the Hearts team a week earlier, and was no doubt excited about how his escape team effectively neutralized all the guests' attempts.
I mean, Rangers had a higher possession, but Livingston used it better.
The first opportunity came two minutes after the first time Menga and the first short delivery of Scott Pittman, then went to Allan McGregor's gol, but he was involved in the execution and had missed the opportunity.
The very long shot of Keaghan Jacobs then reached Captain Craig Halketta, but the tears of his defence assistant Alan Lithgow failed to settle in the hole.
In the last three years, Rangers have taken control, but the game has shown more hope than a real desire to win.
Alfredo Morelos was quite confident that after a race with Steven Lawless 15 minutes of the race, a criminal shooting would have to be carried out, but Judge Steven Thomson's request for Columbia was thrown into the chariot.
Rangers managed to put only two bullets on the floor for the first time, but he didn't shoot with his head that sent him against the naked Lassan Coulibaly, nor the yellow tongue of Ovie Ejaria, nothing for the doorman Liam Kelly presented any danger.
Livingstone's introductory floor in 34 minutes may have surprised everything, but it was already fully deserved for its endurance.
Rangers has failed to discover another Jacob's long-term continuation.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher took the lead in Scott Robinson, who prepared Mengi routinely for the simple conclusion of the attack.
Gerard took action and, during his vacation, Coulibaly replaced the wing player Ryan Kent, who immediately showed up with the award of Morelos, but Kelly effectively attacked his lines and blocked the attack.
However, Livingstone continued in his work, and the guests moved into his game, where Lithgow and Halkett took care of several items in front of the floor.
The Holt team could still increase leadership at the end, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow was unanticipated after the data from the cat.
At Rangershis, Glenn Middleton was given the chance of a criminal shooting after his encounter with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson did not recognize him.
Almanah: Exemptor of Geiger's Count
We represent a party from the Almanac of our Sunday edition: September 30, 1882, so today, more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany, who later became known worldwide physics.
Geiger developed the method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, which was the basis for the development of the device called Geiger's number.
In the scientific world, he became a chair, and he also got his place in pop culture, said in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played the piano scientist:
Men: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's number. It's used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you hit the audience, you can just hear the effect it has on the atomic radioactivity in materials.’
Evans: "Madonca, they're really advertising now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before the 63rd birthday.
Isomy with his name, and he lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can be learned by the immune system to recognize attack cells
A new cancer vaccine can be learned by the immune system to recognize and destroy attack cells.
The vaccine in therapy teaches the immune system to recognize attack cells
This method includes the acquisition of immune cells of patients who have subsequently been modified into the laboratory.
They may then see a protein that is relevant to a number of forms of cancer and then return to the patient.
The results of the test vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received the vaccine that the immune system is learning to recognize attack cells, ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method includes the acquisition of the immune cells of patients who change them into the laboratory so that they can ‘see’ HER2, which is significant for a number of forms of cancer, and then re-inject.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute for Cancer Research from Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘incentives the growth of several different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and fat cancer.
A similar approach to the recovery of immune cells of patients who ‘learn’ to target cancer cells has also been used in the treatment of leukaemia.
Kanye West, after arriving at SNL, made a protrumppus point with the MAGA on the cap.
The population was not inspired
Kanye West was quoted in the Satuday Night Live award study for a surprise point, during which he expressed support for US President Donald Trump, and also said that 2020 would take place for the presidential chair.
At the end of the third song, called "Gohost Town", he wore a cape with the letter "Make America Great Again", the West began with the attack on democracy and reiterated his support to Trump.
"It often happens to talk to a white person and he says to me, 'How can you like Trump, but he's a racist?'
"Well, if I'd been worried about racism, I'd have to leave America recently," he says.
The current SNL surrender began with a family with Matt Damon, in which Hollywood player charged Britta Kavanaugh before the Commission for Justice in a Senate accused Christine Blasey Ford of a sexual assault.
West's monologue was not predicated, and it was put on the social network by the comics of Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock was going to be out of the West with this.
The West also accused the community of having some problems in writing to the capital.
"For the grown-up they have dealt with me.
They told me not to go to the top or the top.
I'm being watched!
They say I'm lost," said the Washington Examiner after the report.
West continued: "Do you want to see a lost scene?" and added that you must hope "Superman's grid, because it means that no one can show me. Do you want the world to move on?
Try with love."
His comments were at least twice prepared by the audience for the swimming and SNL team members were in a clear mood, and someone told Vanity, "There was a death silence in the studio."
The West was invited during the exchange for Ariano Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
The West has already caused a lot of surprise with the videotape for the song "I Love it", where he wore the costume of the glass glass of the mineral water marks Perrier.
Westa supported Candace Turner, head of the conservative TPSA group, who complained: "One of the most famous souls: thank you for being UPRL RAJI."
The head of the speech department, Karen Hunter, claimed that the West is simply "what it is, and that's clearly fine.
However, I will not reward anyone (with the purchase of his music, clothing or the support of his "art"), who, in my view, salutes and spreads the ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
And so did I.
Before the delivery, the rapper on Twitter announced that you changed his name and will then "bike, formally known as Kanye West. Now I'm YE."
He's not the first singer who decided to change his name, and he did it before, already did it, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His local colleague Snoop Dog once named Snoop Lion, but we cannot forget another musical legend: Prince changed his name into a symbol, and then he was an artist, once known as Prince.

The Star Game of the Kit Harrington Desktops Exposed Against Toxic Manhood
Kit Harington is known for his involvement in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's exciting medieval fantasy series of game boards.
A 31-year-old player who strongly condemned the stereotype of a masculinist hero says that because of such a role on abandoned boys, they often feel that respect can only be earned with courage.
Kit told the magazine The Sunday Times Culture that something went wrong, and asked how to cope with the problem of toxic masculinity during the movement #JazTudi.
A player who recently married a 31-year-old soccer player from the Rose Leslie Board Game admitted that he had strong convictions on this subject.
"I personally sincerely wonder where we have made a mistake when it comes to men," he said.
"What have we taught men about the problems we are facing now? "
Kit thinks that television is partly responsible for increasing toxicity by showing very potential people.
He continued: “What is nature, and what is learned?
What are we taught on television and on the streets to make young men feel that they have to choose a certain amount of men's wages?
I think it's one of the important questions of our time, how can we change it?
'Cause it's obvious that there's something wrong with young men.'
In the interview, he also said that after the end of the series the following summer he would not participate in any negotiation or continuation of the Game of Ships, since he ‘closed the battlefield and horses’.
Kit will play a key role in the new presentation of True West Sam Shepard, the story of the film producer and his brother.
The player recently discovered that the best thing that happened because of the game table was that he met his wife, Rose.
"Because of this series, I met my wife, so she somehow gave me my future family and life from there," he said.
Rose is in a fantasy series won by Emmy, playing Ygritte, a loving selection of Kitto's son, Jon Snow.
A couple were married in June 2018 to the family of Leslijena in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports on 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say that more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 only about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In most new cases, the disease has been transmitted to sexual relations, which represents a change compared with the past.
In some parts of China, HIV has generally spread rapidly because of the transfusion of infected blood.
However, according to data from Chinese health officials from a conference in the province of Junan, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has decreased almost nothing.
Still, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS continues to grow annually in China for 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV to sexual relations in the Chinese community of LGBT is a very serious problem.
Homosexuality was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very prevalent.
Since conservative values are still in force in the country, 70 to 90% of men having sexual relations with women are reported on in time.
The disease is often transmitted because of the inadequate protection of sexual relations in such situations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised general access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters is alleged to have issued data on Republican senators, "hazardous lies" and "serious theories"
In Saturday, the US Congress of Maxine Waters rejected the complaint that a member of her staff published information on three American Republican senators on their website in Wikipedia.
The democracy of Los Angeles has claimed that these charges are brought by individuals and websites of the right.
"Talk, lie, and even more unacceptable lies," Waters wrote in a statement on Twitter.
The information published following the statement includes domestic addresses and telephone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrina Hatcha from the Utah federal state.
These data appeared online on Thursday, which was published by an unknown person with Capitol Hill, during the session of the Senate on sexual harassment of the candidate for the Supreme Court, Bretta Kanaugh.
The information was received after the three senators concluded with the hearing of Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as the Gateway Pundit and RedStates state that via the IP address, it is possible to recognize the source of the publication that should be linked to the official Senator Waters and to conclude that information has been published by someone else, reports Hill.
"These unfounded accusations are completely wrong and pure lies," continues Waters.
"My employees, whose identity, personal data and security are threatened by these false charges, are not in any way responsible for hiding these data.
These unfounded accusations are completely inaccurate and pure lies.’
The statement by Senator Waters was quickly launched on the Internet, including by former White House Press Representative Arija Flecher.
"From this neglect of the wind wind," Fleischer wrote.
"This may mean that it's not from the real test for the Congress.
When you accuse someone of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
You can't stand it.
And we must not doubt the cause of the one who accused him.
It must remain calm."
Fleischer compared Waters' response to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who accused him of being too angry during the fourth hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate, who is active in interlocuting the city of Waters, announced through Twitter.
"If that's true, it's true," he threatened.
In her statement, Waterssa announced that her office had notified "the appropriate institutions and bodies of the breach concerning these false charges.
"We will ensure that the workers are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be responsible for all acts that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and to all of them."
Johnny English again in stock - Rowan Atkinson as a secret agent
The search for targets at Brexit in any new British film has already become traditional, and it also applies to the restoration of Johnny English’s share comedy, which came first in 2003 with the title of Johnny English and continued in 2011 with the title of Johnny English 2.
Will the fun satisfactory about how we're done, a new export opportunity for us?
Incompetent Johnny English with the eyes and unusual grays are granted permission to relocate the strike; he has already ordered it to be a comical character created for a cinematographic audience in non-English speaking areas.
It is for an unborn secret agent, who, despite his extraordinary movement, contains part of Clouseauja, Mr. Beana's cousin and the minority of the one who contributed to the last note of the Chariots of Fire at the ceremony on the opening of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
It is also based on the traveler and the international secret network that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten TV class for Barclaycard, where he left for himself the real chaos.
In the latest film, one or two pleasant moments are presented.
I liked it when Johnny English was approaching the helicopter, he wore a medieval hat, and the rotor lists were short on his head.
Atkinson's comedy gift is clearly displayed, but humor seems to be a few blogs and too unnecessary, especially because "real" films such as 007 or the Mission can't now offer comic elements without a bad news.
It appears that as humor is intended for children and not so grown-up viewers, so for me to reject Johnny English's experiences are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson's will is not in the role of Mr. Bean.
The permanent theme is now clearly that Great Britain is in real trouble.
The online hacker has been infiltrated into the network of the most secret British agents on the Internet and has uncovered the identity of all British agents, which has caused serious problems to the competent agent, represented by Kevin Eldon in a surprising small role.
This is a premier, a poignant figure that has already experienced evil because of political intolerance: Emma Thompson has already tried for the role of supposed Terese May, but there is nothing in the scenario that can help.
The intelligence service informs her that all active drivers are exposed, so it must be decided for one of the retired drivers.
And that means Johnny English, now a teacher at a public school, who is not officially teaching how to work under the sun: the scanners have done it, because English is performing some kind of war "academia rock".
English are taking them to Whitehall to an emergency meeting where they meet with a long-term partner, Ben Miller, who plays it.
Bough is now married to the captain of the submarine, a stereotyped sports fan, the role that Vicki Pepperdine has lost a little.
So Batman and Robin are prepared to create more problems in the name of the secret service of her Highness, and they meet the deceased Ophelio Bulletov, who plays Olga Curylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems: this is the evil Jason Volta, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough spread their dress: dressed in a fire-fashioned fire in French restaurant, created chaos when it was overheating on the floor of Volt's jacket, and when English tried to use eyeglasses for obvious reality to meet the interior of Volt's house, he managed to create a general chaos.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite the sensitivity and energy it mentions in the child film.
Very average.
Like other movies, Johnny English can't help me here and I can't think: is the British film Atkinson able to play a role that will actually justify his talent?
The labs claim that Britishs plan a four-day work week, which would pay for a five-day working week.
Laburist partner Jeremy Corbin thinks of a radical plan, where the British would work four days a week, and receive a payment in five days.
The manager of the company wants the savings generated by the company's artificial intelligence revolution to be transferred to the workers and allow them to be added to the day-to-day.
This would be how employees would enjoy a three-day weekend with the same high salary.
The sources say that the idea is consistent with the economic plan of the parties and the plan to put the State on the side of the workers.
The unions support the transition to a four-day working week, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the advantages of changing economies.
A source from the Laburist Party for The Sunday Times said: 'The policy review should be published before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a quarter-day worker is a goal that we will try to achieve with the approach of the parties to the balance of the economy for the benefit of the employer and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Laburist Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Thursday work week in its campaign during the general elections in 2017 was supported by the Green Party.
However, this objective is not currently supported by the Laburist Party as a whole.
The representative of the Laburist Party said: "The Thursday work week is not a party's policy and the party does not think about it."
Cancler, in the shadow of John McDonnell, used a lab conference last week to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that it was decided to cut the power of the 'free' and 'benevolent' in municipal companies.
The plans of the sun also mean that current participants in water companies may no longer receive the full share, as the laboratory party could introduce “recovery” on the basis of the alleged errors.
He also endorsed plans to include workers in the Administrative Committee and to introduce the Owning Funds so that 10 per cent of the shares in private companies would be transferred to employees who would receive an annual dividend of up to 500 GBP.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, discussed in the report '60 minutes' ('60 minutes') whether their opinion could be altered by the investigation of Kavanaugh, which is conducted by the FBI.
The investigation of the charges against Judge Bretta Kavanaugh, conducted by the FBI, noted the final vote on his appointment in the Supreme Court for at least one week and a further question whether the authorities of any Republican senator could convince the judge to withdraw his support.
In the interview delivered on Sunday, the Secretary of the Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked whether the FBI could find anything that would change his opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than a South Carolina colleague.
'I mean, of course,' said Kennedy.
"Before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh
When I called him when this complaint appeared, I asked him, ‘Did you do this?’
He was determined, unafraid, uncertain.’
And Graham's voice seems to be stuck in the rock.
"I have created my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and would need a very convincing reason for his change," he said.
“ I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know the following: Brett has been very disappointed, ” adds Graham, quoted by Christine Blasey Ford.
"And he could not prove this to any of those whom she named.
The case is 36 years old.
I do not see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how has it contributed to the reduction of poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Global Citizens, an annual musical event where a truly exceptional kind of star is involved and which has the same excellent mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
The festival, which will take place this week, will be attended by dozens of people. They will sit together in the Great Central Park not only to enjoy the events of singers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise interest in the real purpose of the event, namely the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival, which started in 2012, is the expansion of the Global Citizens Project, an international group of prisoners hoping to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a simple event entrance (except if you were willing to pay for the VIP entrance), the participants had to perform a type of task or "action", such as volunteers, letters to the world leader, telephone call or any other means of raising awareness about their objective of poverty eradication.
And how successful is Global Citizen's movement, which has remained for 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts the right way to convince them to ask for action, or is it just another example of so-called "clicitivism" – to make sure that people really have an important impact on the situation with online petition signatures or tweeting?
Global Citizen's movement suggests that since 2011, more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters should be noted in efforts to achieve a variety of objectives.
It is true that these actions have helped global leaders in the adoption of commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which would affect lives by 2030 more than 2.25 billion people.
In early 2018, the group indicated that the fruit of its 390 commitments and communications, based on which at least 10 billion dollars had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that resources have now been directly affected by almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, the partner of investors and decision-makers who are committed to "help the child achieve their full potential" promised by Ruandi to contribute 35 million dollars to the elimination of malnutrition after more than 4700 tweets have been received by Global Citizens.
“With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens, as you are, we can repair the social crime of storage in the historical archives,” said many at a concert in London in April 2018 by Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the partnership Moč Pregrane.
The Group also said that after more than 5,000 actions taken by the government, which called on the United Kingdom to improve food for mothers and children, the Government announced that it would co-finance the Power of Food project, which would reach 5 million women and children with food measures.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, "Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?",
a global citizen’s movement replied: “It will be a long and hard way – sometimes we will fall and fall.
But as with the great movement of civil rights and the fight against apartheid before us, we will succeed, as we are stronger together.
Among the performers who will be present at the annual event in New York, are Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae. The event will lead Deborra-Lee Furness in Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy – the US Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Russian energy export "blockade".
US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke would say after reporting the Washington Examiner magazine that Washington could use the Navy to prevent the Russian energy market, among other things in the Middle East.
Zinke said that Russian mediation in Syria (it should be noted that the government should be invited to legalize) an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire for energy markets, as they are marketed in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," he would say.
In the opinion of the officials, however, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States can fight this. The Navy will ensure that our maritime routes are open and block them, as necessary, so as to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market," he said.
The facts referred to an event hosted by the Energy Consumer Union, the useless group, which is known as the U.S. 'the voice of energy consumers'.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, which he warned that it was actually the same.
"As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic potential has been more or less impact on fuel and their replacement," he said, marking Russia as a "ponie known as a trik", with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements were made at the time of the attempt by the Tromp's administration to increase its exports of liquid natural gas to Europe, where Russia, which is the most important choice for European consumers, was to be replaced.
To this end, Trumpo's government officials, including U.S. President Donald Trumpom, are trying to convince Germany to give up the "unimplementary" gas project North flow 2, which would make it possible to be behind the Berlin "talec" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the North River 2 gas pipeline is worth 11 billion USD, which would double existing gas capacity at 110 billion cubic metres, except an economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington is actively opposed to the project only for economic reasons and that it is in the process of unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we have the same position that energy should not be a tool for implementing pressure and that consumers must have the right to select suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a September meeting with American Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow.
Germany rejected and confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organisation, the German Industry Union (BDI), called on the United States not to engage in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"Integrating a third country to our energy supply means a lot to me," said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German industry (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angelo Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "studently examine" her candidate for the 2020 American presidential elections, the real Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "examine her candidate for the American president after the interlocutory elections."
In the city house in Holyok, Massachusetts, Warren has confirmed that she will think about the candidate.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and correct our corrupt government, which requires women's leadership," said journalist The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will examine my candidate for President-in-Office."
Warrenov won a meeting in the city house by President Donald Trumpa, for "that country would lead in the wrong direction."
"What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy, I'm worried about," she said.
Warrenov has already been criticised several times by Trupa and the candidate for the President of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh.
In a tweet published on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before elections."
The survey published on Thursday showed that most of her own voters believe that Warren in 2020 should not be challenged for presidential position.
According to a survey of the University's Political Research Centre in Suffolka/Boston Globe, the senator should not be nominated as president, with 18% of "probably" voters from Massachusetts.
Twenty-three percent would support her candidate.
The survey showed that there was greater support for the candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick, which would support 38 percent of the investigators, and 48 percent would oppose her.
The second high-level Democrats, who would come to the attention of the candidate for the 2020 elections, were former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
After reporting to the Associated Press agency, Beden said he would be officially decided by January.
Sarah Palin mentioned post-traumatic stress disorder in support of Donald Trumpu
Track Palin, aged 26, has been in the army for years in Iraq.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with family violence.
"Because my own son, who lives after his return, leaves me with other families who cope with post-traumatic stress disorder and a certain degree of injury that our soldiers are returning with," said the municipality, in support of Donald Trumpu in Tulsi, Oklahoma.
Palinov's son's arrest marked the "slon in the salon" and caused her son and other military veterans to return a number of modified, confused, asking where respect for what the soldiers and the aircraft and all other military members had given to the State."
Traka Palina was arrested on Monday at Vasilla's place in Aljaski and charged with violence in the family with assault on women, the arrest of violence in the family and the possession of weapons in the criminal state, said Dan Bennett, the representative of the police station in Wasill.
18 bound countries and the Colombia Environment Supporting the Towards of New Asian Policy
Eighty-eight federal states and surrounding Colombia support the legal defence of a new American policy, which protects victims from violence or family violence, deny the right to asylum.
The NBC News Agency reported that representatives from 18 countries and the above-mentioned environment had met the court's claim to support the legal defence of the policy.
The full name of the complainant in Greece v. Sessions filed by the American Alliance for Civil Liberties against Federal Policy was not published.
She said that her partner and "his violent sons, members of the mob," abused her, but the American authorities rejected her asylum request on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The State prosecutors of the Federal States that support Grace, Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which numerous asylum applications are made in the United States, have described as countries that are faced with problems with torture and family violence.
In 2014, the new US asylum policy repealed the decision of the Committee on the Appeals of Migrants, which was not bound by an immigrant who fled from domestic violence, allowing asylum applications to be submitted.
The state prosecutor of the District of Colombia, General Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "takes the decades of national, federal and international law."
‘The binding law requires that all asylum claims be assessed on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the application, and such prohibition violates this principle,’ the court stated.
The State prosecutors further stated in the request that the policy which the immigrant is deprived of the right to access is harmful to the US economy, as it would be more likely that they would become entrepreneurs and that they would "provide the necessary labour force".
The General Public Prosecutor Jeff Sessions has decided not to give June more asylum to victims fleeing from domestic violence and torture.
"Azil is available to those who leave their home country because of the persecution or fear associated with race, religion, nationality or membership in individual social groups or political opinions," said the Sessions on 11 June in their policy release.
Azil was never meant to solve all the problems, even the real problems that people face every day throughout the world.
The number of victims in Palau has doubled, but there are busy attempts to find survivors
For survival, the situation was worse.
"The feeling is very tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, when she offered her warm boyfriend at the evacuation center in Pala.
"The rescuers continue to bring the body.
It lacks clean water.’
It was seen moving back to destroyed houses that were moved through the heavy objects and tried to find anything useful.
The injuries were caused by hundreds of people and hospitals that destroyed 7.5 levels of damage were overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwii Hariz, who suffered the injuries of the back and the shoulder, were located outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were on the ground because of the continued severe growth problems of the disease.
When he mentioned the violent earthquake that struck the hotel room in the fifth floor where he was raised with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
"There was no time to get rid of it.
I think it hit me against breaking the wall," Harris told the agency Associated Press. He added that he was with the family in the city because of the wedding.
"I heard the woman who called for help, and then she was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China’s “addiction” with “propagandised declarations”
One week after the publication of a four-way announcement of the official newspaper of China in the American journal, which praised the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador to China Peking accused the abuse of the American press for spreading propaganda.
American President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's pay-up supplement last week in the newspaper Des Moines Register – the best magazine ever sold in the federal state of Iowa, after China accused the interference in the American Congress on 6 November, as China's party.
The Reuters agency reported that the US federal officials accused Trump of trying to intervene in American federal elections described as a new phase in the more intense efforts of Washington to pressure China.
Although the advertising of commercial promotion ads is common to foreign governments, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in the most intensive trade war in which the price of import products is exchanged.
The Chinese refund rates at the beginning of the trade war should affect exporters in the countries of the Union, such as Iowa, which is supported by the Republican side of the country, and Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to the Chinese and former long-term governor of Iowa, the chief exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Peking was injured by American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in a column in the weekly edition of the newspaper Des Moines Register, "Now this post is being doubled by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press".
"In spreading the propaganda, the Chinese government has used an estimated American tradition of free speech and free press to publish a paid announcement in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, you will see only a few other opinions and no real reflection of the diversity of views that Chinese citizens have about the worrying Chinese economic path, as the public is closely controlling the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most important Chinese journals has rejected the offer for publication" of his article, although he did not specify which.
Republicans lose their volitions before interlocutory elections with the end of Kavanaugh, warning analysts
Analysts warn that the support of a number of the most important republicans who support and challenge candidates for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh, despite multiple complaints of sexual assault, will be known in the coming internal conflicts with the loss of votes.
The feelings are extremely high here, and most Republicans have already said they want to continue voting.
This cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of politics at Maxwell University in Siracuzah for a post published on Saturday in The Hill magazine.
Reeher said that there is no doubt that Senator Jeff Flake's pressure to investigate the FBI will be sufficient to calm angry voters at the latest.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it either tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the group's progress movementOn, on Friday, after reporting from Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors burned 'November came!', when they demonstrated in the Senate hall when the Republicans, who were in charge of the judicial committee, decided to continue supporting Kavanaugh's appointment in spite of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's speech, reported the press portal Mic.
"Democratic inspiration and motivation will overcome all boundaries," said the portal journalist Stu Rothenberg, a non-participative political analyst.
"People say they're strong now, and they keep it.
However, it could be even more powerful, especially among undefined voters in the provinces and smaller voters aged 18 to 29, who do not like the president, but who do not often like it."
Even before Ford's public talk, in which he described his complaint about the sexual attack of the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts had said that further Republican support could have a negative impact.
"This has become a big mistake to the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Council, after reporting to the NBC News agency in the beginning of last week.
"It is not only for the vote of the world or the final vote or of Kavanaugh's imprisonment; it is also for the way the Republicans support it and treat Fordovo," said Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priority Group, who supports democracy in elections.
And the Americans seem to have a few split up between them, or more likely to believe the story of Ford or Kavanaugh, while a few more support them as the next one.
The new YouGov survey says that 41 percent of the investigators are sure or most confident of Ford's testimony, and 35 percent of them have done so to ensure that they believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent of them thought that Kavanaugh was probably lying or certainly lying, and only 30 percent said about Ford.
Following the pressure of Flake FBA to investigate the charges filed by Ford, and at least one prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Fordova was a week before the Senate's court hearing, and she was threatened by Kavanaugh when she was 17 years old, in a guilty state.
Ramirez says that she was shown sex when she was together at the party during her studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The founder of the World Web aims to start a new Internet to meet Gogol and Facebook
The Berners-Lee, the owner of the world website, is opening up a commercial company that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Googlu.
The last project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berner's open-ended Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview for the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose of Inrupt was "to rule the world".
"We have decided to do this now," he said about the new company.
"The game for a historical moment."
The application uses a Solid platform technology that allows users to create a "special database for data storage" or a POD
This may include contact information, schedules, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is similar if you were Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser and at the same time.
The privacy of the personal database for data storage is that the user can determine fully who can access the information.
The company calls this "special data recovery".
Executive Director John Bruce says the idea of combining resources, processes and appropriate skills that will allow access to the Solid platform to everyone.
The companies are currently forming Berners-Lee, Bruce, a safety platform purchased by IBM, some of the found developers for work on the project and the community of volunteers programmers.
With this week, technology developers around the world, using tools available on Inrupt’s website, could create their own decentralised applications.
Berners-Lee said he and the group "with Facebook and Google are not talking about whether they could introduce a complete change that could remove all their business models through the night."
"We do not ask them for permission."
In his release on the Media portal on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt "to ensure commercial energy and ecosystem for the protection of the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee completed the Internet with the establishment of the World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute for Technology in Massachusetts (MIT).
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Berners-Lee will also be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"As regards the next time of the network, I am extremely optimistic," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Festival of the Victoria Cross from World War I
In the home city for 100 years, they celebrate the award of a victorious cross to the only priest of the Church of England who has won him as a warrior in the first world war.
Honourable Colonel Bernard Vann deserved recognition on September 29, 1918, in an attack on Bellengles and Lehacourt.
But four days later, he was shot by a shooter, so he never realized that he had been given the highest honor in the British military.
On Saturday, at the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two Colonels discovered a monumental stone.
One of the lawyers, Michael Vann, said that the stone was “extremely symbolic” to be discovered about 100 years after the Grandpa's act, with which you deserved the reconnaissance.
After a report by the journalist London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal of Saint Quintina "through very closely and under the powerful fire of war fields and machines."
He later planned against the shooting squad and led on with the “major uniform” and then attacked the machine and handed down three members of the department.
Colonel Vanna, on 4 October 2018 – just a good month before the end of the war – shot a German shooter.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his father's actions were "something I know and could never reach, so teach me humility."
With his brother, Dr. James Vanna, they were also put in a venison for the parade led by the Queen Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said to feel "very honored to be able to participate in this paradise," and "that the courage of the real hero is reflected in the support that many people will express."
The enthusiasts over mixed battle skills burned all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they were part of Puise Pepe.
Imagine: All night long you've noticed that Bellator 206 was completely sold, and then you can't see the main event.
The event in San Jose was attended by 13 couples, including six in the main park, and was transferred to the United Kingdom to live on the 5th channel.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to clear up, observers in the United Kingdom found that the transfer had been replaced by the introduction of the Russian Pepa.
Marcido wasn't really excited, because he stayed awake until tomorrow because of the doubt.
One of the characters on Twitter described a child’s risk as a "some kind of painful joke".
"In accordance with the government regulation, this content was not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a child programme," said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of Bellator's organisation for marketing and communication when they asked him about the transfer.
"Pusha Pepa."
The president of the Bellator organisation, Scott Cooker, said they were trying to adjust the clock so as to include future observers in the United Kingdom as well.
"When I think about reproducing, I think we can do this," Coker said.
"But then there is six o'clock in the morning on Sunday, and we will not be able to do this until Sunday after our time or Monday after them.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, there's been a number of exchanges and not all of them were pleasant.
We tried to settle the matter; we thought it was only a technical error.
However, there was an actual reason for the government regulation.
I can promise you that this will never happen again.
Instead of six, we will have five fights – as usual – and we have tried to offer more than expectations to the worshipers, and we have succeeded in doing so.
It is a very ungrateful situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "unvalued" about sex.
Olm Daley said that because of his sexual orientation, he felt inferior to everyone – but this gave him reason for success.
The 24-year-old said that it was "not everyone like" when he entered high school.
In his first speech in the Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne, on Radio 4 for radio station Radio, he said he spoke about the rights of gays to give another "hope".
He also said that when he became an elder, his desire to win the Olympics was diminished.
The regular director of the long-term mission, Kirsty Young, was absent because of a multiple-month illness.
Daley, who appeared as an exorbitant in Laverne's first assignment, said that he felt less valuable than everyone else, because "it was not socially acceptable to have boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, this feeling of worthlessness and differentity is an actual thing that gives me the strength and endurance to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that he was “someone”, he said that he would not disappoint anyone who would finally make his point.
Once again, the Olympic athlete became an influential advocate of the LGBT rights and twice a year appeared on the Games of the People's Community in Australia in order to call on States to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy that he could talk openly without consequences and that he wanted to give others a "hope".
The three-fold world leader said he was a novelist with a male – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 – “pretty.”
Daley, with a 20-year-old contender, has been reporting for years, but he says that the difference in years has never been a problem.
"If you're so young," said his first Olympic games at the age of 14 and his father died three years later, "it's hard to find someone of the same age who's going to experience the same mood and fall.
In June, a couple adopted a child, Robert Ray Black-Daley's son, and Daley says he changed his "whole view" with this.
"If you were to ask me for a year, everything I should have said would be 'I have to reach gold medallion'," he said.
"But, you know, in the world there are more things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The son bears the same name as Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 because of cancer on the brain.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he would have to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to sit in the first place.
I couldn’t say to him, “You won’t be the first one, Father,” he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and he was dead, I had to finally admit that he was not harmless," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and achieved a bronze medal.
"I knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life – to be in Olympic games before the local community. There was no better feeling," he said.
This was also inspired by his first choice of songs – the Proud singer Heather Small, who followed him in preparation for the Olympic Games and who still wears his skin.
The Desert Island Discs are delivered to BBC Radio 4 every week at 11.15 (BST).
Unprepared Mickelson's Saturday Ryder's guest took over.
American Phil Mickelson will be playing his 47th game in Ryder's gifts on Sunday, setting up a record, but he will have to come back in shape so that he won't be an unhappy frontier.
Mickelson, who will be working in the binary event for the 12-year-old record, let Captain Furyk sit on Saturdays.
Instead of being in the middle of the event, as was so often for the United States, the five-time winner survived a part of the day as a runner and a part in improving his game in order to fix his weight.
Given that neither on the top of the career nor measured the best course, 48-year-olds do not fit the most difficult Le Golf National game, where long-term ice is inevitably punished by the wrong hits.
And if only the game wasn't scary enough, Mickelson would have dealt with the exact winner of the British Open Francescom Molinari in the ninth game this week with the newsman Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans who have at the beginning of 12 individual games had less than four games, well started, the Michaelson game could have proved decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he didn't say enough.
"He fully understood the role he had today, touched me on his back and killed me with his hand and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"There's a lot of confidence in you.
He's one of the famous and he's in the past, and he's been bringing this week to the teams.
I guess I didn't imagine him playing two games.
I represented you more, but it came out that way, and we thought it should be done.
He wants to play, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will record Nick Falda on Sunday for the largest number of currents played in the Ryder Cup.
This could indicate the conclusion of Ryder's career, which never really agreed with the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 swords, 20 hits and seven hits, but Furyk said his presence in the team also brings some unacceptable benefits.
"It's fun, it's funny, it's exciting, it's spiritual, it's working out of people and it's wonderful to have it in the team space," he explained.
"I think younger players were having fun when they moved this week with him, which was fun to see."
It gives much more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon be achieved
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain from experience, knows that an important priority can easily be turned into an unpleasant ride at the beginning of the last day's game for individuals in Ryder's tribe.
In 1997, young Danec co-debated in the Valderram game, where the party who was the captain of Seve Ballesteros had five points of advantage before the Americans, and the goal was to move only with priority for the forest, resulting in 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
"Don't forget that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but rarely," said Bjorn (in the picture) at the view of the Class of 2018 team, who won from 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, and told Le Golf National from 10-6.
That's why my story, and everyone in the team says she's not finished yet.
You play full tomorrow.
Go ahead and do whatever you need.
It's not over until it's written on the table.
We have a goal to win this prize, and we must remain focused on it.
All the time it has been said that I focus on 12 players who are on our side, but we also know who is on the opposite side – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn, excited about his players ’ game at the required game, added: “You would never be over there.
It'll be another day tomorrow.
Tomorrow will be in front of the individual game, so it will take another flight.
It's nice to have partners when things go well, but when you're there alone, your golfers are tested to the end.
This is a message you must pass to the player: Tomorrow you must get the best out of yourself.
Now let your partner be for you, and he must draw out of you the best."
In contrast with Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they played as partners, except Jordan Spietha and Justin Thomas, who reached three points from four.
Furyk was already on both sides of the revolution in the last day, as he was part of the victory team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser when Europe carried out the "Courage in Medina".
"I remember all the words you're talking about," he answered when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, told his players on the final day of the game.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important courses, but we would start working as fast as we saw in Brooklyn as we saw in Medina.
When this start gets permanent, it's strong pressure on the middle of the game.
We've created a proper setting and put the boys in a way, until we felt we'd do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to fight and match Rory McIrroy in the best game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the second Europeans in the upper half of the series.
"In this group of boys, I have decided for this kind of order, because I think it covers all the schedules," Bjorn said about the choice of individuals.
New German military ship re-existed
The latest fleet of German seafarers should be made available in 2014 to replace the old warships from the cold war, but because of the distortion of systems and rapid growth costs, local municipalities will not be reported until the next year.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz" ship, the leading ship of the new class of Fregat Baden-Wuertemberg, is now translated into the first half of 2019, a journalist named Die Zeit, who appoints the military representative.
The ship should join the 2014 Navy, but the ambitious project raises concerns after delivery.
The four classes of Baden-Wuertmberg, appointed in 2007, will replace the ageing class of the Bremen class.
It is expected that they will have a powerful ball, type of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft explosives, and some hiding technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include further maintenance periods – the latest frigates in order to remain outside the domestic port for up to two years.
However, the continued delays mean that the upper warships, which should enable Germany to influence the Mediterranean also, will be considered as old-age journalist Die Ziet.
An unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the headlines when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
At first it happened that the mariner returned to the shipyard after supply.
The reasons for the return are known only for a small number of reasons, and the German municipalities have indicated a number of key "programming and technical deficiencies" which would make the military ship useless if it were to be sent to the war mission.
The lack of programme equipment was also particularly important, as the Baden-Wuertmberg class will manage a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the workforce on the older frigates of Bremen class.
It has also been shown that the ship is a very heavy burden, which reduces its capacity and limits the sea’s potential for its future restoration.
The 7000-tonn vessel "Rheinland-Pfalz" should be twice the weight of a similar class ship used by the Germans in the second world war.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the cost of the whole project has also become a problem – including the training of crews.
This would reach EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion) from the start of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are also particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the maritime power of Germany is declining.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Committee, admitted that the mariners are actually "lost ships suitable for landing."
The officer said that the issue was temporarily interrupted because the old ships were wrecked and the replacement ships were not secured.
He regretted that the sailors could not join any ship from the Baden-Wuertmberg class.
The National Fund belongs to the secret life of netophilus
New research is being carried out at the presence in Scotland, in which you are trying to find out how non-towers use food for food.
They hope that the results will re-enlighten the conduct of these unique flight crews and help to focus on future conservation activities.
In the study, the scientists of the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will monitor small neuter and small neutropires, and the Networks will host neutrophies and ducts at the Inverwe Gardens property in the Western Ross area.
In key locations, special recorders will be set up to monitor the activity of non-tertiary events throughout the entire season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using manual detectors.
The professional sound analysis of all the tracks will confirm the frequency of calls of netopyra and what kind of action they are doing.
Then they will prepare a residential map and report to create a detailed picture of their conduct throughout the country.
Rob Dewar, NTSC consultant for conservation of nature, hopes that the results will show which habitats are the most suitable for non-temperature and how they are used by each individual species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the management of habitats, such as the creation of grasslands and the conservation of forests for non-terranean and other species.
The number of non-stop populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has decreased dramatically in the last century.
It threatens the construction and development work that affects the shelter and the loss of the habitat.
Risks also represent wind turbines and lighting, as well as molluscs and some types of chemical processing of construction materials, as well as attacks on home cat.
Netopiers aren't really blind.
Because of the habit of money at night, you are better able to help with your money than with your eyes.
In order to determine exactly the error and error of the flight path, pre-defined ecologicalisation techniques shall be used.
The NTS, responsible for providing more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land per country, is taking no too seriously.
He employs ten experts who regularly carry out research, inspection of shelters and temporary solutions.
The organization has established even the first and the only Scottish reservation, especially intended for non-to-temperature, at the presence of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway.
The property manager David Thompson says the property is an ideal territory.
"We have a great area for non-terribles on Threev," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all quality habitats.
However, the difficulties are still well known, so the work we are doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to succeed."
He stressed the importance of verifying the presence of non-combatants prior to the maintenance of the holdings, as the possible unplanned destruction of one family member could result in the death of up to 400 singles and young people, which could mean the loss of the entire local population.
They are protected, so they are forbidden to kill, torture or torture them, and they are also forbidden to destroy their relatives.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish director of the Non-Employment Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to cooperate.
She said: "We still have to learn a lot about our own people, and for a number of species, we simply don't know how their populations behave well."
Ronaldo rejects the charges of violence and lawyers are preparing for a German magazine complaint
Cristian Ronaldo called for the "false news" and said that people wanted to "promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing for a charge of German magazines with the newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the complaint.
The attackers of Portugal and Juventus claimed that in 2009 in the hotel room in Las Vegas, the US was forced by Kathryn Mayorga.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he would then pay $375.000 for the event milk.
In a statement of 142 million followers in the Instagram Live video several hours after the report, Ronaldo, 33, reported a "false news" sign.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they did is false news," said the fifth-time winner of the Golden Gown in the chamber.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which belongs to the work I do.
I am a happy man and I want everyone well," the smiling player added.
Ronald's lawyers, after reporting to Reuters, are preparing for the Der Spiegel review of the charges referred to as "unacceptable reports of doubts about private life".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will demand compensation for "unprecedentable damage in the amount corresponding to the truth of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years."
A local incident to take place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino apartment in Las Vegas.
The document submitted to the District Clark District Court in Nevada to return to the player's room after meeting with the Major's club at night with Ronald.
Major says that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the above-mentioned incident and said that he was a "99% good man" who was disappointed only in "the percentage."
The documents claim that Ronaldo has confirmed a sexual relationship, but he described it as an agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she approached the police and took photos of her injuries in the hospital and later agreed to an external solution because she was "seriously afraid of torture" and was concerned about "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old claims he wants to re-examine, because he still has a serious trauma due to a mental event.
Ronaldo was only in the face of a sudden attack from Real Madrid in Manchester United, and this summer he moved to the Italian capital Juventus, worth 100 million dollars.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will always regret" the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "would always regret it" if it had lost the status of the leading world car manufacturer after the crash, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK for BBC said that the UK exit from the EU without agreement would temporarily stop production in the stock market in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of the delay on the border in the case of a Brexit without an agreement could lead to the loss of jobs.
Tovarna Burnaston, which manufactures the Toyotin model Auris and Avenis, produced nearly 150,000 cars during the run-up year, 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that in case the Great Britain would leave the European Union at the end of March without agreement, production in our warehouse would stop," said Marvin Cooke, Toyotin Administrative Director of Burnaston.
Concerns about the effect that the exit from the European Union without agreement on cross-border trade have also been expressed by other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom, including Hondo, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
The BMW company, for example, said that after Brexit for a month she would close her shop Mini in Oxford.
The main ideas relate to what car manufacturers call the risks associated with the supply chain, in the case of Brexit.
The Toyotin production line is operated by ‘in the right time’, where supplies from the United Kingdom and the EU for cars arrive at every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom did not come out of the EU on 29 March without agreement, this could lead to confusion at the borders for which the representatives of the panograms say it could lead to unemployment and unemployment.
Toyota in his shop in Derbyshire would not be able to co-ordinate for more than one day, the company's representatives did, so the production would stop.
Mr. Clark said that therese May's future relationship plan is "exceedingly dead for the loss of such border checks".
"We must reach agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will enable us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success but to seize this opportunity," said today's BBC 4.
"The data not only toyote, but also other producers are that we must be absolutely capable of continuing a highly successful collection of supply faiths."
Toyota could not comment on how long production would have been stopped, and for a long time it warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the industry and ultimately lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in the Burnaston factory for 24 years and is the founder of the U.S. union in the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: "After my experiences, the job will never come back."
The government representative said: "We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be reintroduced, the real White House
An important meeting of Donald Trumpa with the deputy prosecutor-in-Office of the General Court, Rod Rosenstein, could be "presented for another week" due to the ongoing colouring of the candidates for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh, which was held on Sunday in the White House.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is studying Russian voluntary intervention, links between the Trompos and Russia and potential presidential interference with the judiciary.
The question of whether the Tromp will release the agent of the Attorney-General and threaten Mueller's independence has been on the rise for several months.
At the beginning of the month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of the hearing equipment for recording talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein's report is missing.
And the last Monday, he visited the White House, in the middle of the report about his intention to quit.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations conference in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that Rosenstein would “not forgive more” and then stopped the meeting to avoid conflict with the hearing of the Senate panel in which Kavanaugh was spoken, and one of the women who accused him of an inappropriate sexual conduct, Dr. Fordov.
On Friday, Trump identified a unilateral investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote of the Senate.
The Tromp's press representative, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox News show Sunday.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date has not yet been determined. It could happen this week, depending on everything else that is happening in the Supreme Court, and it could be postponed for another week.
We'll see. I always want to make sure you're informed."
Some reporters would agree, Sanders never called the White House meeting with the press since September 10th.
Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the frequency of the meetings is not going to give rise to the "setting" of TV reporters, but she said, "I couldn't deny that they are setting up."
Then she mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president held more press conferences than any president before him," she said, adding, "We have looked at the figures without mention."
The meetings will still take place," Sanders said. "If journalists can address the President of the United States directly with their question, this is definitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to make this possible and you have seen that we have often done this in the last few weeks and that you will have a conference you can talk to the President of the United States."
The Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or attending open meetings or press conferences with the guests.
Unique press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why when he appeared to the assembled journalists in a rather modest and somewhat odd manner.
Letter from the Minister for Health of EU workers in NHS Scotland concerning the anti-fraud
The health minister wrote to the EU staff working on the Scottish NHS to express appreciation for the country and would like to continue the work even after the patent.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom exits from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to the payment of the costs to regulate the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued on the issue, as I approach the decision-making process.
However, the government of the United Kingdom has also been speeding up preparations for a possible scenario of an exit without agreement.
I know it has to be a matter of great concern to you all the time.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff regardless of his nationality.
Fellows from all over the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and benefit the patients and the communities we provide.
In Scotland you can feel fully at home. We really want to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie urgently operated after head injury
Tennesse State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, a linear supporter of the Tennese State of Tigers, has been reported to Mike Organ from The Tennessee magazine following the head injury of 31:27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores.
The main trainer of the Tennessee State University told the journalist that the damage happened just a little before midnight.
"He came to the game's slave and somehow got there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel provided Abercrombie with oxygen before they put it on their clothes and carry it from the toy for further examination.
Chris Harris from the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee, said that Abercrombie is recovering after surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "the details of the type/range of injury are not yet known" and that the University of Tennessee is trying to determine when the damage has occurred.
Abercrombie, who is currently a virgin at the university, plays for the Tennessee State University first after moving from University to Illinois.
On Saturday he experienced five hits before he left the game, which his total number of hits in the season moved to 18 hits.
Foreign buyers will charge higher rates when buying real estate in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged higher rates when buying real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used for the new homelessness schemes.
The move will neutralize the success of Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
Increase in the amount will be calculated by those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The warehouse expects her to collect up to 120 million pounds a year, and she'll hire them to help the homeless.
A foreign buyer will calculate the higher level of cash in the United Kingdom when buying real estate, and the money will be spent on the homeless, and theresa May will be reported today.
The pressure should be understood as an attempt to neutralize Jeremiah Corbin's efforts to attract young voters with promises to ensure a more affordable location and higher taxation of high-income persons.
The increase in the amount will be calculated by individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and will encourage government efforts to eliminate unemployment.
The yield, which will be calculated in addition to the current quota, including the higher levels indicated two years ago for other households and non-premises for distribution, could not be less than three per cent.
The depositary expects to collect up to EUR 120 million per year from the introduction of the measure.
According to the estimates, non-compliance with the United Kingdom should buy 13 per cent of newly built London negotiators, resulting in two prices and more difficult purchases of first non-promotives.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “spirits” because the number of buyers who survive most of their time abroad is increasing.
The new policy was adopted only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the number so that young people could buy their first home.
A large construction company has accused the increase in prices with a country that is not actually using it, Mr. Mayevo has called for the release of quotas for price-free accommodation in order to correct the British "stationary shame."
Mr Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the supervision of rent and the completion of forced displacements without error.
In addition, he wants to give the local world greater powers to build new houses.
Mr. Mayeva said: “In the past year, I have done so that I will renew my primary leadership of British dreams – that life must be better for every new generation.
It also means the correction of our non-permanent housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and create life.
However, it cannot be true that it is as simple for people who do not live in the United Kingdom as it is for foreign companies to buy houses as simple as for British citizens.
For too many people, dreams of their own home are too far away, and the humiliation of independence remains too real.”
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to manage the Scotland Club"
Chief Sanderland, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is ever to become the manager of Scotland club.
The 42-year-old Scotland enjoys the challenge of the restoration of the North-East club, currently seating the third city in the First League, with three points less than the first.
He moved to St. Mirren in the last season to the Scottish Presidency.
"For my country I wanted to play as a player.
I got a B cap, and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I grew up in Scotland as a child in Hampden, so it was always something that drew me back.
This opportunity would only be offered to me if I had succeeded in running the club.’
Ross's predecessors at the head of Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyt and Paulo Di Canio.
The former mayor of Alla Athletic, who had previously rejected the offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, says that as a successor of such great names, he did not feel afraid.
"I have a measure of success for myself with the question "Can I bring this club back to the First League?"."
In view of the structure and capacity of this club, there is no doubt in the First League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but it would probably be a success only if the club could bring it back."
Ross is doing the manager's work for only three years after he was the assistant leader in Dumbarton and 15 months part of the training staff of Hearts.
Alloy then helped to prevent the exit into the third league, and St. Mirren brought from the robbery the title of the first priority in the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real break," Alloe recalled.
"I was truly convinced that management is the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It's funny to hear it because it's been like a good player, so I've lived a good life, and I've also achieved some more success.
But the game can become demanding.
Every week you have to deal with a number of things.
I still struggle with this in terms of stress and pressure at work, but management just feels like the right thing for me.
I always wanted to run a club and now I do it. I feel more comfortable in my entire adult life now in my skin."

The summer heat increased the incomes of the British brigades, but also increased pressure on religious restaurants.
In July, groups of pubs and barons sold more than 2.7%, but the income of restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA business consultant who prepared the data, said: “The constant solar time and participation of England in a world charity that lasted longer than expected meant that July followed a similar pattern as June last month, when the income of the pubs increased by 2.8 percent, only if the restaurants were even stronger.
The decline in traffic in restaurants by 1.8 per cent in June has increased in July.
The traffic in pubs and bars with drinks has increased in comparison more than in restaurants.
As a result of solar time, sales in pipes that offer mainly food were also reduced, but not as dramatic as in restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go for a drink.
In various pubs and bars, the sale of a drink increased by 6.6 per cent in one month and the sale of food decreased by three per cent.’
Paul Newman of the Free Time and Hospitality Analysis Group of RSM said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The biggest time factor and the impact of major social or sports events on the sale of guests on the market remains.
It is not surprising that the Group of Restaurants continues to fight, although the drop of 4.8 per cent at mid-year level will still be particularly painful because of the low cost pressures.
For local owners with long-term food temperatures, it would not be possible to arrive at a better time and only time will tell whether the necessary recovery will bring more moderate temperatures that we have experienced in August.’
The joint sale in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 % in July, which shows the gradual introduction of trade marks.

One of the five children has a secret account on the social network that hides it from parents
The survey showed that there is one of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, on the social network a secret account hidden before parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 diaries showed the growth of the fake Instagram page
The newspaper has reinforced the fears of publishing sex-related content
Twenty percent of diaries have been made to have a "main" account for parents
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, creates an account that is hidden on social networks before parents.
The survey of 20,000 diaries showed rapid growth of false Instagram accounts.
The paper has reinforced the fears of publishing sex-related content.
Twenty percent of the diamonds have been used to manage the censored "main" account that parents say they have, and they also have private accounts.
The mother, who found herself on the cover of a 13-year-old girl, noticed that the daughter called the visitors to strengthen her.
The research carried out by the Digital Awareness UK network and the HMC of independent schools has shown that there are 40 per cent of the 11-18-year-olds, and half of them recognise that they have a private account.
President HMC Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many seniors are subject to temptation and create a web space where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elidh Doyle will be "vote's vote" on the Scottish athletic board
Elidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish athletic committee as the non-executive director of the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most famous Scottish athletes in the field, and on the free and president Ian Beattie described this move as a great opportunity for those who direct sport to use its extensive experience at international level in the last decade.
"Eilid is enjoying great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletes' community. We are confident that the athletics in Scotland with its inclusion in the committee would greatly gain," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to be able to act as a voice for the athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help with sports management in Scotland."
An American who won from the total of four Olympic medals in the course of 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta and is now a regular commenter for BBC, has remained unspoken after a transitional ischemic attack.
On Twitter he wrote: “A month ago, I was hit by a sword.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said he'd just tell me if I could come back and tell you how much.
The work was hard, but I did it all over again, learned to walk again, and I'm running yours for agility today!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!"
An announcement for a toothbrush that compares mother to cows has divided the online opinion
The company which manufactures toothbrushes has divided opinions into a declaration comparable to the cow's cow's mother's.
At the beginning of the market ‘the first silence of the transmissible brakes’, Elvie has published a protracted video announcement to the mother that would show all the freedom that the aid would allow.
The four real mothers dance in the company of cows in the mirror, filled with the old one, in a song that includes the following words: "Yes, I'm tired, but I don't see any scratch," and "If you haven't noticed, it's not my tits, it's my tits."
The package goes on: "Drink, suck, feed babies, suck, suck, touch babies."
However, the advertising published on the Facebook website has caused a great deal of confusion online.
After 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, he saw mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom claimed to be the "gross" of the milk industry.
‘The use of the requirements for advertising this product is a very weak decision.
Like me, they also hang and jump to make milk, but they have children stealing from them in the first days after the wedding," one wrote.
Elvie's finger is gently attached to the breast-feed (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Of course it is traumatic for both mother and youth.
But why not use them to announce breast-feeding for mothers who keep their children?'
Someone else added: "A voice completely without feeling."
The others praised the announcement, when one of the women admitted that she seemed to be singing "for church fun".
"It seems to me a genius idea.
I'd buy it if I still had it.
I felt just like a cow.
The announcement was a few norms, but I understood it as it was thought.
It's a genetic product," she wrote another.
Someone commented: "It's a funny announcement aimed at mothers who suck milk (often at the workplace or the site) and feel like cows."
This is not a declaration that would commend or condemn the milk industry.’
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were dancing with hideous cramps in the dark.
The concept of action is that many women who breast-feed mothers say they feel like cows.
Elvie Pump is completely quiet, with no needle or syringe and is discrepancies in the breast milk, which enables women to move, hold the child, and even the activity on the ground during milking.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD in the matter, continued to comment. "The Elvies Church is such a revolutionary product that you deserve a decent and provocative representation."
As a result, the comparison between women who are breast-feeding and the cows we wanted in the milk industry to pay attention to breast-feeding and all its challenges, but in a funny way that women can relate to, show an incredible feeling of freedom that the new breast-feeding will bring.
That's not the first example of Elvie's approach to the headlines.
During London's week fashion, the mother of two children on the Maneken trail traveled to form Marto Jakubowski when she used the product.
Hundreds of children of migrants who are quietly transferred to the coastal camp
The number of children detained by migrants has increased considerably, even if the number of months of the crossings remained unchanged, partly because the redundancy of rhetoric and policies introduced by the Tromp's administration made it difficult for children to deliver to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors of undocumented migrants are afraid to risk their own ability to stay in the country with the child's request.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other family members of households would have to give fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Agency, said before the Congress, that the agency arrested more than ten people who had been asked to sponsor young people without training.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of arrested persons did not have prior criminal records.
"Nearly 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or family sponsors are illegal in the country, and most of these are punished foreigners.
That is why we continue to search for these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In order to speed up the treatment of children, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court in one month after they were arrested, and not after 60 days of the previous standard, the workers were informed in court.
Many will show up with the videoconferencing call and not personally to speak before the immigration judge.
Those who feel that they are not eligible for aid will be quickly expelled.
As long as the children are in custody, it is more likely that they will become pregnant or depressed, which may result from the statements of workers in shelters and reports that have occurred in the system in the last months, leading to violent explosions or attempted escape.
The prosecutors said that these concerns were greater in larger institutions, e.g. Toronto, where the signs of children's stress due to their size are more likely to remain undetected.
They added that they could move children to a place of lodging, not to prepare them emotionally or to give them an opportunity for a word from friends, the trauma that many of them encounter.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish 'occupational forces' to withdraw immediately
In the agreement of the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem invited Syrian refugees to return to their homes, even in the country for eight years.
Moualam, who also carries out the Prime Minister's duties, said that foreign forces on Syrian bases were illegal, under the pretext of fighting against terrorism, and that they would "actually deal with them as well".
"Unreasonably and unconditionally they have to get away," the congregation said.
Moulalem said that the "war against terrorism" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died in 2011, and millions had to leave their homes, "just finished".
He said that Damascus will continue to "warn this sacred battle until we clear the Syrian territory" both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
In Syria, the United Nations has about 2,000 soldiers who primarily train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar Al-Asada.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-disrupted countries on its territory.
With regard to refugees, Mouale said that the conditions were appropriate for the return, and charged "some Western countries" for "the spread of unreasonably fears", which the refugees were persuaded to remain in a foreign country.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to their easier return," he said.
"The political issue changes what should be the only humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have urged Syria not to receive renewables until the end of the war has been reached by Asad and the opposition.
The diplomats of the United Nations say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of the Tamapon zone in the last important opposition zone, Idlibu, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented the massive attacks of the Syrian forces supported by Russia on a province where three million people live.
However, Moulal stressed that he had a " clear deadline" agreement and expressed the hope that military mediation would be directed against the Jihadists, including the fight from Fronte Nusra, associated with Al-Qaido, which would be "resurrected".
Ambassador of the United Nations, Staffan de Mistura, hopes that he will soon call for the first meeting of the new committee, which will be composed of members of government and opposition, to prepare a military stand for Syria and press the way to the elections.
Mouale identified the conditions of the Syrian Government for cooperation in the Committee, stating that the work of the Committee should be limited to “the review of the members of the present constitution”, and warned against interference.
Why Trump's gonna do another mission
Following this decision, Mr Trump will win the re-elections in 2020 unless, as a matter of fact, a number of liberal observers, his presidency will have a premature end with interpolation and scandal.
Which would no doubt be "the most dramatic final presidential ever!"
There's no sign of weakness of viewers for now.
Since 2014, the CNN's visibility during the largest inspection has doubled to 1.05 million, while MSNBC's visibility has nearly doubled to 1.6 million.
The Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers, more than four years ago after Nielsen had 1.7 million, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC channel has reached the largest number of cable players with 3.5 million viewers on the night of important news.
"It's a fire that draws people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, director of the drama "Designed Survivor", about the cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack of Capitol.
Nell Scowell, a well-known comedian writer and author of the book "Only funny parts: and some hard facts about driving in the Hollywood Boys Club," offers a different explanation.
Remember driving with a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd love Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,' he told me.
There's a fun value in the box.
Of course, contrary to what is seen on television, the story of Washington could decide on the future of Roe's case against Wad on whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
The exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Nevertheless, the six-hour review of the circle of experts discussing the use of the source “from the deep background” for the book “Strah” Bob Woodward, USD 15,000 worth of new mouth jackets ("the dress, weight-based by the shot", said The Washington Post) and the consequences of the shocking descriptions of Trump, khm, anatoms.
Sam, for example, I'm never going to look at Super Maria again.
"A part of his start-up, which stimulates the idea of real commitment, is that he offers something every night," said Brent Montgomery, the principal director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment company and the founder of Pawn Stars about the assembly of the Trumpo show and the day-to-day scandals (twice with N.F.L., Kim Jong Una).
You can't afford to let go of any episode, so you'll be in the shelter.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, he was outside his home on the northern coast of Kaaija 80 degrees (26.7 °C), but he was fascinated inside when he was filming CNN.
In no way was he able to withdraw, nor did Brett Kavanaugh meet with the Senate committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was high in the air.
"I remember that we then created all these crazy surrenders and people said, 'This is the end of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

External money is made available in preparation for the most intimate inter-sessional election
It is not surprising that in the 17th Pennsylvania area, the flow of money was observed, as two candidates were in the race for the same seat because of the reorganization of the convention environment.
This was the home of democratic representative Conor Lamba, who won his seat on the special elections last year in the new Pittsburgh area.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old Pennsylvania 12 environment, which is heavily covered by the new 17 environment.
The cards were re-arranged when the Supreme Court of the Pennsylvaniaan Court of Justice of January ruled that the old environment was counter-arranged for the benefit of the Republicans.
In the context of the new 17th environment, the fight for the financing of the campaign between the main parties to financial telesomims, the Congress Committee for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely followed March special elections for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This seat was attended by the Republican for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the circle.
Political commentators are giving the Democrat a great deal of advantage.
In the United States, they were considering sanctions against Salvador for the support of China, and then they withdrew.
Diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Peking, despite a little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varelo in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners removed Trump's leadership.
The officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to withdraw the US diplomatic mission leaders in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "response to the recent decision to withdraw the recognition of Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, Minister of the Ministry at the beginning of the month.
However, the sanctions were considered in respect of Salvador, which would receive US$ 140 million after 2017, including aid to combat drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included restrictions on financial assistance and targeted restrictions on the issuance of visas, would seriously affect the Central American country with great unemployment and the number of deaths.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference aimed at security and economic development, which would continue to hold a similar meeting during the year, which was assessed as a step forward in preventing migration in the United States.
By mid-September, however, the highest government officials had explained that they wanted the conference to continue, with the conclusion that they had considered the sanctions for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now obliged to negotiate a conference that is now planned for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance of the American government signing a meeting, the diplomats have added.
Three US envoys, however, returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House for Mr Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to the discussion on them under the terms of anonymity.
Their testimony confirmed an external analysis that was close to the government and also discussed it under the terms of anonymity.
Historical comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible closure of the judiciary, which is now very much evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller should also direct the investigation to whether Mr. Trump's campaign was working with Russia in an attack on the American Revolution.
If the convention is to change its hands, Mr. Trump will have to respond right away before the authorities and perhaps even before the jury of his colleagues, as soon as he is ready to speak again to his voters.
There is a lot of questions in this regard and I do not want to say that Mr Trupa's fall is inevitable, nor do his peers in Europe as well.
On both sides of the Atlantic we will have to make decisions that will affect how long the war could be.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to launch an attack on Hitler if the West would attack him and support him in Munich.
We didn't make it, so we missed the opportunity to get rid of the clowns that followed.
Such tragedies change the course of history and accelerates or impedes an inexhaustible approach to democracy.
The Americans are right now with many of these novelties.
What will we do if Mr. Trump leaves the deputy general prosecutor General Roda Rosenstein, a man who has in his hand the case of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in prison since he reported that he had proposed a secret video of the president and expressed his inadmissibility to this position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the report of The Times was incorrect.
"How will we respond if the requested investigation by FBI Bretta Kavanaugh is not exceptional or fair, or if it is appointed as a Supreme Judge in spite of credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interlocutory elections for the Congress, which will require Mr. Trumpa's responsibility?
If we're going to fall through these tests, we're waiting for a long winter democracy.
But I'm sure it won't upset us for the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once sat in my missionary home.
She survived, immigrated in America, and 60 years later, she ordered me to hold a cup of tea on the table with the swastikas.
How could such a heritage not be optimistic about our future?'

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic before encountering Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will visit Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and it is clear that they will be defeated by Austria after the impressive campaign against Villarreil in Spain at the beginning of this month in a credible position for the qualification of the Group G of the European League.
The damage of the knee was prevented by the connected player Graham Dorrans from appearing first in the season in front of the 2:2 range against Villarreal, but I believe that Rangers can use it as an escape for more achievements.
"It was a worthy point for us, as Willarreal was a powerful team," said 31-year-old.
"In the game we entered into the confidence that we can achieve something and bring the point.
You might be able to win at the end, but there's probably a fair result on the overall team.
They were probably better in the first half, so we showed up and we were better at the second half.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope that we can get three points, but this will be a hard game because the final game has had a good outcome, but I'm convinced that we can do it and achieve a positive outcome.
The last year has certainly been difficult, in view of all that has happened, including the damages and changes in the club itself, but I have a good feeling about this end now.
Team is good and boys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope we can continue now, let's leave the last season for ourselves and succeed."
Poor Spanish woman due to fear of the stocks
Despite having a clear picture of how to care for them, the investigators talk to their family members about it.
Half of the investigators of the Nationalwide Insurance Agency's investigation have been able to discuss the costs of long-term care by law.
Only 10 percent of them were able to talk to children about it.
"People want to take care of a family member, but they don't try to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the life insurance sector at the National Guard.
You can start in the next way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare to take care of yourself if you don’t talk to her about it right away .
Talk to your counselor and family about where and how you would like to receive care, as this can be an important factor in assessing the cost.
Include a financial adviser: Your financial adviser can help you find ways to pay these costs.
Your selection of long-term care funding may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and a life insurance policy to cover these costs or self-insurance with own funds if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles during the transition.
Choose a health representative so that you can determine the trust of a valuable person who will monitor your health care and ensure that experts will take into account your health wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, the authorization of persons for their finances.
Choose the trust of a valuable person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are not able to do so on your own.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in need of medical help and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergic reactions?
Write these data into the action plan to be prepared.
"It's not just for your finances. Do you know doctors?" asked Martin.
‘What medicines do you take?
"Who's gonna take care of the dog?
I am prepared for this plan."

Posts and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a violent earthquake and tsunami, which struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the number of victims increased.
In the disturbed communication links, rescuers from the Dodrea Regent, north of Paluja, which is closer to a magnitude 7.5 expansion epicenter, could not obtain any information.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated to Palu.
Some key data on Paluu and Dodhii on Sulawesia:
Palo is the capital of Central Sulawesia, a province located at the end of the deep sea on the west coast of the island of Suvavazi and should have a population of 379,800 in 2017, according to estimates.
The town celebrated the 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunamis.
Dodrea is a landscape that extends more than 300 km (180 km) along the north-west of the island of Suvavazi.

The main economic activities of the Central Sulawesi region are fishing and farming, especially in the central region of Dodrea.
In the country, there is also the important activity of mining, which is mostly carried out in Morovalia, on the opposite side of Sulawesia.
Palu and Dodheo have repeatedly been affected by the tsunamis in the last 100 years after the Indonesian Agency's report to alleviate the effects of natural disasters.
In 1938, he caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dondria.
In 1996 he also struck north Dongreo and caused the death of nine people.
Indonesia sits on the active Tihocean fireplace, which is why the eruptions occur regularly.
In recent years, there have been some increased stress and tsunamis as follows:
2004: More floods on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on 26 December have caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian coast, more than half of them in Acehu.
2005: The type of violent riots has hit Western Sumatra late March and early April.
More than a hundred people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Potres Magnitude 6.8 was injured by the southern part of Java, the most inhabited Indonesian island, and by the tsunamis that flooded her southern coast and caused almost 700 people to die.

More than 1100 people died.
2010: Potres Magnitude 7.5 hit one of the islands of Mentawai and blew the peaks up to 10 meters, which destroyed your shower and caused about 300 people to die.
2016: The plague of the plague hit the kingdom of Pidie Jaya in Acehu and caused death and panic when people remembered the death and tsunami of 2004.
This time he didn't break down the walls, but the collapse of the building caused more than 100 people to die.
2018: More earthquakes have affected the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok and caused more than 500 people to die, mostly on the northern side of the island.
Potres destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily detained thousands of tourists.
Arrest of the oldest son of Sarah Palin for violence in the family
Traka Palina, the oldest son of the former governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
29-year-olds from the end of Wasilla, Alaska, were arrested on account of family violence, family registration and arrest, the police agency Alaska State Troopers reported on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin knew that when he tried to call the police to report a suspected criminal act, he took the phone from time to time.
Palina was arrested at Mat-Su Pre-Cazing Station and was detained under an unsecured guarantee of USD 500, the TV network KTUU reported.

It was also charged with one category B infringement, which is punished on the same day in prison and deep in the amount of USD 2000.
The fire of the criminal action is not charged first.
In December 2017 he was accused of assault on his father, Todd Palina.
Mom, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a mental attack.
The example is currently before the Aljas Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of violence in the family, involvement in the notification of violence in the family, and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state in connection with the event.
The fire girl told me he hit her face.
Sarah Palin was criticised in 2016 when his son’s violent conduct associated with post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service in Iraq.
Funerals in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake, which struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 fires and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communication networks have been broken down, and the number of deaths should be increased in the coming days.

On social media, video clips show the moment of the strike.
When he hit the coast with the tsunamis, more than a hundred people were held in the city of Palu at the festival on the beach.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutors in New York require a death sentence for Saipla Saip, a suspect for a terrorist attack in New York where eight people have died.
Saipov, 30, to use a freight truck to carry out the attack on the rail road along the West Side road in South Manhattan, when he carried several passengers and passengers in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saip has killed eight victims and caused serious physical harm, which is recorded in the notification of the death penalty requirement in the South of New York.
According to the court document, the cause of the death penalty may be any of the charges.
More than a week after the attack, Saipov’s large-scale jury reported with the complainant in 22 points, which included eight charges of murder by means of rape, which are commonly used by federal prosecutors in the case of organised crime, and the charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for a "famous planning and accompaniment" by the prosecutors who described Saip's way as "stupid, cruel and vindictive".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused damage, damage and loss to the family and friend of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Draka, Ariel Erlie, Hernan Ferruchia, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannuccoa," was written in a notice of intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The District Court for the Southern Environment has been sentenced to the last death penalty ten years ago.
The accused Khalida Barnes was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers, and eventually he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was finally pronounced in New York City in 1953 by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who died as a result of the loss of the Soviet association between the cold war two years before.
Both Rosenberg died at the electric table on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, citizens of Uzbekistan, in the days and months of the attack following the attack, did not show any regrets in the documents.
According to the police, he told the investigator to feel good about what he did.
According to the complaint, Saip's authority said he was inspired by the ISIS videotape you've seen on the phone to carry out the attack.
The police also said he asked for an ISIS ban to be released in his hospital room.
In the case of the 22nd point of the complaint, he said he was innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were clearly disappointed by the decision of the prosecution.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting the confession of guilt in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of release for all involved will only prolong the tolerance for this event," Patton said.
Saip's defence team has asked the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
For the negotiations with regard to Brexit, NIGELA FARGEA, a true Turkish Ambassador should be charged
Nigel Farage today, during a protest at the Toric conference, promised to "immobilising the human army".
The former leader of Ukipa said that European politicians must "feel anger" when one of their own envoys Therese May suggested that he should be held accountable for negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative Ambassador Peter Bonne, on his way to Birmingham, said that the United Kingdom would "be out now" if he would be a secretary for Mr Farage's brigade.
However, the challenge facing him, Mayeva, in coordinating his deep-distributed species, was still highlighted by the thoraxes, forced to renounce Brexit, who joined a separate protest against brexitis in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain its plan in the fight between the attacks of Brexits, Brixists and the EU.
The allies insisted that Mayeva, in Brussels, would try to reach agreement despite opposition and force Eurosceptics and Laborists to choose between their package and "casom".
Mr. Bonne was at the Leave Means Leave (Decision means departure) in Solihul that "he wants to destroy the Chequers".
He said that we should appoint Mr Farage as a co-rapporteur and assign him the responsibility for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he had been charged, he would have been out by now," he said.
The messenger from Wellingborough added: "I'll support the brexitis, but we need to get rid of the Chequers."
His opposition to the EU was described in the following words: "We have not fought in the world wars to be servants now.
In our own country, we want to adopt our own laws."
Mr Bone rejected the proposal that the public opinion since the vote in 2016 has changed: "The idea that the British have thought and want to stay in the EU is completely inconceivable."
Also, Turkish Brixist Andrea Jenkyns, who told the rapporteur, said: “I just say, ‘Minister President, listen to the people.
The Czechers scheme at the general public is unwelcome, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is also unwelcome with our parties and our activists, who are active on the streets and even lead us to the election.
Please leave the checks and start listening.’
In the message, directed by Ge Mayev, he added: "Premiers shall keep their service when they fulfill their promises."
Mr Farage agreed that it was necessary to give politicians a "feeling of anger" if they intend to issue a decision adopted at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us – humanity – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to give up the biscuits, and we're gathering today to say, 'We won't let you do this.'
In the message, the excited majority added: "I want you to give our political class, which is on the job to publish brexite, to feel anger."
"We mobilize the human army of this country, which has given us victory at the brexity, and we will not be at peace until we become independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the repairers ran through Birmingham, where they then had a court hearing in the city center.
The activity group's pessimists are slowing down this weekend with the Torics' arrests against brexitis.
The Laburist tribe of Lord Adonis laughed at the conservatory because of security problems in the application of the party after the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can set up an IT system and all technology for the Canada agreement plus, for the border without restraint, for simply trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a perfect step.
There is nothing like good brexite," he added.
Warrenov will probably be in favour of the position of the president "examined"
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that "co-operation in the presidential city will be thoroughly studied" after November's elections.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a meeting with citizens in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warrenov, who is often critical of President Donald Trumpa, will again take action against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was Vice President of the Trump's Volunteer Campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It's in the center of speculation to be able to cope with Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in the form of a town hall, since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she was going to negotiate for the president's place.
Warrenov replied that it is time for "the grass of women in Washington to fix our corrupt government, which requires a woman on top."
Arrest after the death of the LSU Sims player in the shooting
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that on Friday the suspect was arrested for shooting the LSU poet Wayda Sims.
The police station in Baton Rougu reported on the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson at the press conference at 11 a.m. after sunrise.
They published a video of the fifth shooting and asked for help in identifying the person on the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early Friday at the South University campus.
"Wayde Sims has been shot in his head and died because of this," said the media chief of Murphy J. Paul, a network of 247 sports reported.
Wade was trying to protect a friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted at the hearing that he was at the end of the incident, that he had a weapon and that he shot Wayda Sims.
The Simpsons were arrested without arrest and taken to police station East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 198-centimeter-year-old boy who grew up in Baton Rougu, played 32 games with 10 beginners, averaged from 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps in the game.
Russia's big prize: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of the World Cup, and the team ordered him to leave Sebastian Vettlu
On Saturday it became the moment that Valtteri Boltas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton, clearly that "Mercedes's crew will have a powerful impact on the race".
Bottas had started well on the farm and almost let Hamilton in the dry as he defended his position in the first two attacks and invited Vettla to attack his own master colleague.
The winner took first into the box and allowed Hamilton to drive on the road map, which should be decisive.
Mercedes took him into the box later and left him for Vettlo, but Hamilton observed after some driving operations that Ferrari's impartiality leaves the inside of the door open and risk that after two attempts to defend the third wheel, he will remain.
Max Verstappen started with the last kind of network and was until the end of the first round on his 21st birthday in seven places.
Then he drove most of the competition without changing the rubber, as he intended to execute the fast finish, overrun Kimia Raikconen and hit the fourth place.
In the box, he finally took the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he was unable to increase speed, so he sat in the fourth place in Raikkonen.
It's a tough day, because Valtteri's been driving fantastically all weekend and was a real horseman when he let me out.
The team did a really great job to reach first and second place," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body speech.
President Donald Trump, in agreement on Saturday, spoke to Senator Diane Feinstein because of her persistence that she did not disclose Christine Blasey Ford, who was a candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh accused of sexual assault.
According to West Virginia, the president did not directly affect Ford's speech before the Senate's investigation commission, but rather he said that what is happening in the Senate was said to be "bad, corrupt and lying".
"The only good thing that can happen and which has happened in the Senate in the last days that we can see anger when you can see that people are wicked, corrupt and lying," he said.
"When you look at publications and disclosures, people say, 'No, I didn't do it'."
I didn't do that."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you find out?
Remember her answer... you opened the document – ‘Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it."
Okay, wait a minute.
We discovered it... No, we didn't," he added about the pressure on the senator.
The forum sent a letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and the media was discovered in early September – but Feinstein's nephew came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's complaint, I didn't reveal her letter," said the Commission following the report by the journalist The Hill Feinstein.
"She asked me for confidence, and I kept her as she asked."
But her disappointment apparently did not fit the president, who agreed on Saturday evening: “I tell you, it was a really bad speech of the body.
It may not be true, but it was the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
In defending the candidate for the Supreme Court, which was accused by three women of inappropriate sexual conduct, the president insisted that the Democrats abuse the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain their power with all possible means.
You have seen evil, pride, no matter who they are trying and who they must drive to overcome power and control," said the President after the Mediaite website's report.
Elite link: Dundee Stars v. Belfast Giants: 5:3
Patrick Dwyer killed two naked men for the Great against Dundee.
Dundee Stars were redeemed for the fifth loss in the Elitni League against Belfast Giants with victory in the Sunday game in Dundee with 5:3.
The Ginants were told earlier about two goals on the inheritances of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were elected to the home side, and then Dwyer again took advantage of Giants.
Francois Bouchard was the winner of Dundee before two grand Lundvald Nielsen gave them a victory.
This was the third victory of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, which was won by Dundee from 2:1 on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the masculinians, where Giants was defeated in the previous three games.
Dwyer reached his first goal in the game in four minutes from 3:35, with Kendall McFaulla, Beauvilleer's assistant, who spent four minutes later, and David Rutherford gave.
In an intensive initial work, Sullivan at 13:10 again placed in the game at home, and Matt Marquardt gave Cowni to be exaggerated at 15:16.
Dwyer took care of Giant's leadership in the holiday, when at the end of his second round of evening at the end of the first quarter.
The domestic party again gathered, and Bouchard won the rest with a violent round at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran have helped together to give Nielsen Dundee the advantage at the end of the second triangular and provided for the victory with the fifth round of his power of Poland and the fifth round of his power in the last half of the third.
Gianni, who now lost four of their last five games, will play the next game in the fifth house in Milton Keynes.
The air traffic controller has allowed more than a hundred people on the plane to flee before the crash
The air traffic controllers in Indonesia celebrates the hero after he sacrificed his life to fly with more than a hundred people safely.
On the fifth trip to the island of Sulawesi, followed by the tsunami, more than 800 people died, and many were missing.
The areas continue to weigh heavily on the rising sun, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although the partners escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung did not leave his job in a powerfullyfuging control chair at Mutaria Sis Al Juffri Airport Palu.
He stayed in it so that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the airway, could safely fly.
Then he jumped out of the control chair because he thought he'd be able to do it.
He died later in the hospital.
The representative of the Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved more than a hundred lives, reported the Australian media house ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter to take him from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a bigger hospital in another place.
We're sorry we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our heart is in the market when we hear it," he added.
While authorities fear that the number of victims of death could reach a thousand, the Emergency Relief Agency in the State has made limited access to the city in Dothria, Sigiya and Bougango.
"The number of dead is going to increase even further, as the number of bodies is under siege, and many of us are unable to reach," said the representative of Sutopo Purwo Nugro.
The palace, where many funerals will take place on Sunday, has been abandoned, up to six meters high.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and care.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the rescue vehicle brings the body.
He's missing clean water.
The minimarkets have been destroyed everywhere.’
Jan Gelfand, leader of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross needs to be hit to help survive, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy that can become even worse."
On Sunday, President Joko Vidodo arrived in Palo and told the National Army: "I ask you all to work night and day to fulfill all the duties related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" after reporting CNN.
In Indonesia, at the beginning of this year, more than 550 people died in Lomboka.
Micro-Aeroplane Navigation: Air Niugini Airport Now says that after air traffic in the cargo, one person is missing
The airline that operated the flight that had flown into the Tihuocean coast in Micronesia is now saying that one person is missing after first reporting that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the passenger plane.
Air Niugini's company announced on Saturday afternoon that there was a lack of male passenger.
In the airport, it was reported that the search for the missing was accompanied by local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
At the invitation for more information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality, they did not respond immediately.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew, after the plane crashed along the water when it was trying to dock at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, officials said they took seven people to the hospital.
The airport company reported that there were eight passengers in the hospital on Saturday who were all in a stable condition.
The reason for the streaming and exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the American Navy have been informed that the plane has just arrived in the port just before the train.
Some of the witnesses said that the plane was wrong.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane dropped very low.
"That's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and his other passengers had managed to cross through the passage of water to forced exits on a floating plane.
He said the guards were panicked and drunk, and I suffered less headaches.
The U.S. Navy said that the sailors who had repaired the bridge near were also able to get help. They were helped with the use of a steaming boat that people carried to the ground before the plane crashed about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the last two decades in the airport accidents in Papua New Guinea, 111 people have died, but this is the first accident that happened to Air Niugini.
Analyticals determine the time of the night when women were alive
On Saturday, the court presented its evidence in a retrial trial to a man who was charged with claiming that a woman from Mississippi was alive in 2014.
The analysis of the US Ministry of Justice Paul Rowlett has been talking for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described how he used phone tapes to determine the movement of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that the location data was received from several mobile phones that showed Tellis and Chambers on the night of her death, contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time he said he was with a friend of Michael Sanford, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford spoke on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him, but Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's warehouse that night, he said he was "a liar, because he was [my] truck in Nashville."
The second clue was that Tellis said that when Chambers died, he knew about two weeks.
The phone calls say they've met in just one week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, in time after Chambers' death from his phone, deleted Chambersina's texts, calls and contact information.
"He wiped it out of his life," said Hale.
The defence should present the final arguments in Saturday.
The judge said that the trial should be judged by the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What's the flag hiphop?

Another black one?!
New York Guard accused a couple of having abandoned her because of a "racist" message
The New York Guard accused a couple of having been discriminated against after receiving the wrong message from the mother who complained that she was "one black."
A few cases of racist conduct and complaint are compared to "expression".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment in 2016 when the new Varuška, Giselle Maurice, came to realize that it was black.
"NEEEEEEEEE OR THE CREDIT," she wrote in her husband's letter, "Plasco-Flaxmanov.
But instead of sending him a man, she sent him two times to Ge Maurice.
After discovering her maturity, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt "disgusting", said Maurice's resignation, saying that her exhilarating guardian, who was an African American, did a poor job, so he wanted to hire the Philippines, reported a New York Post journalist.
Mrs. Maurice received a pay for one day's work, and then they sent her home with Uber.
From now on, Maurice's money at the court is demanding compensation in the amount of USD 350 per day for the period of six months for the work for which she was first hired, even without contract.
"I want to show them, you know, these things don't start," she told Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination."
The couple responded to the charges of racism with the claim that the release of Maurice was reasonable because they feared that after her apology they would no longer be able to trust her.
"The woman sent her something she didn't want to say.
We're not racist.
We are not racist," said Joel Plasco's husband to Post.
"Would you be willing to trust your children to someone to whom you were innocent, even if it happened with a favor?
Your newborn?
Come on, come on.'
In comparison to the "circumcision" complaint, Plasco said his wife was born two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
“Are you going to get over someone like this?
This is not good," the investment banker added.
Although the proceedings are still before the Court, the Court of Public Opinion has condemned a couple of social networks for its conduct and way of thinking.
The stories about the bear Paddington were told not to connect to the speech bear, a new letter was discovered
Karen Jankel, a daughter of Bond, was born shortly after the book was accepted, says of the letter: “It was hard to put into the skin of someone who had first read the book before it was published.
It is very fun to do this now that Paddington has become an outstanding success."
She said that her father, who worked first as a cameraman for BBC, before getting the inspiration to write a book about a little bear toys, would have been angry when he refused his work, added that after his death he was the 60th anniversary of the book "Green-Successy".
With regard to the bear Paddington, who described him as a "very important member of our family", she said that his father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a man who didn't like to praise himself," she said.
"But since the bear Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if your child had achieved something: You're proud of him, though you're not really doing it yourself.
I think that the bear Paddington looked in the same way.
Although it was his idea and his opinion, success has always been attributed to the bear Paddington himself."
My daughter died, and I had to call her.
On arrival, her daughter was transferred to Louis Pasteur's Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"She called over regularly to tell her that she felt really bad, that she didn't expect this to happen," he said.
"Then I got Nado's call. He told me she was going to die in the next two minutes, and I had to say good-bye to her.
And I'm here.
I said, "Tashi, that's how I love you, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications given to her by doctors to keep her heart steady were slowly taken and left her system.
She's been dying for a while, and that's the end of her life.
I just had to sit and wait, you know, it's all gone.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in position when my family and people surrounded me.
I really had to hold on."
Ednan Laperouse, who is now mourning the loss of her daughter, flew into the plane with other passengers, unaware of the experience she's leaving.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head covered, and all the time they were in my face with the sun.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt this strong feeling of sympathy to Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how he loved her."
Grieving female pets crying to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one in suicide attempt to deny life to others.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys, on the wall of the Wall Street, are crying with exciting messages and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Mr. Tyler was 13 when he fell into depression and died at the age of 18.
"For no parent I don't want to feel like I do every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, aged 45, who lives in Sydney, said that her son was an obscenity cook with a funny smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They have always said that his smiles shine each room."
Before his death, however, he ceased to work because he was “a really dark place”.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found a neighbor when he took that life.
Mr. Davis said, "I'm not worried that there will be a dominant effect."
Mr Davis made you cry, "to let others know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's for friends.
Don’t sit in silence – you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who was Davies' friend for many years, lost his mother shortly after her 15-year-old partner.
"He did not say to feel tired, depressed or otherwise," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day he was completely on the floor. When the children opened the gifts, he did not establish an eye contact with them or anything like it.”
She said that his death was a terrible tragedy, but they had to deal with it: ‘ She was pregnant in the whole family.
She broke up with us.
But we must continue and fight."

The future of Bretta Kavanaugh was seen at the beginning of the FBI investigation in the air
"I thought that if we could actually carry out what he asked for – after the duration and extent of the limited research, it might be a point for us," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the world would be 'loss' due to a tight side.
Why do Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want FBI investigations?
Their resistance is the result of the time in which the investigation would take place.
Up to the interlocutory elections that will take place on 6 November is only five weeks – if the Republicans are to be able to do what they are expected to do, this will make them very weak when they try to elect a willing person at the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush repeatedly phoned the senator to avail himself of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and who was presenting him to his current wife Ashley, now Bushev's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI prepares the report?
A vote will take place in the Senate currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could have gathered at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would have led to the defeat of the position and election in the Supreme Court by Mike Pence.
The number of North Korean refugees decreased below Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea in South Korea has fallen, since Kim Jong Un came to the area seven years ago, said South Korean Ambassador.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to the data of the South Korean Ministry of Association, said 1127 people were missing during the run-off year, compared with 2706 2011.
Mr. Park said that they were the key factor in controlling the border between North Korea and China and raising the price required by silencers.
Pjonging hasn't made this public comment yet.
Most refugees from North Korea are finally offering South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegal.
Most of them escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to reach than a heavily secured demilitarized area between the two Koreans.
The Chinese consider refugees to be illegal migrants and not refugees and often repatriate them strongly.
The relations between the North and the South – which have been technically still in war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang at talks focusing on the stills of negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after a June historic meeting between US Presidents Donald Trump and Kimo Jong Unom in Singapore, where they generally agreed on a Korean-free half-life effort.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong has been sentenced to American sanctions since then.
"With no confidence from the United States, confidence in our national security will not be trusted, and in such circumstances we will not be divided unilaterally," said Mr. Ri.
Nancy Pelosi marked Britta Kavanaugh for "historic" and claims that he is not suitable for service at the Supreme Court
The head of the minority House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, was a candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh, marked "historical" and said that he was significantly inappropriate for service at the Supreme Court.
Pelosie did so in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't think of a different woman, if she knew so, as a 'historical'," Kavanaugh's fourth speech to the Senate's Committee of Investigation commented on Pelosie.
Kavanaugh was gravely accused of sexually assaulting Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were the youngest.
In the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very sensitive, often nearly incendiated and engaged in discussions about his family and middle - school life.
He also strongly condemned the democracies in the Commission, and the charges against himself were marked as a "great and coordinated fraud" organised by liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosie said to me that Kavanaugh's speech proved that he should not be appointed to a Supreme Judge, because it showed that he was anti-democratic.
"I think it has been discrepancy with such statements and ways of fighting Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelosie is asking whether she will attempt to file a constitutional complaint against Kavanaugh if it is approved and Democrats receive a majority in the House of Representatives, for a moment she has become.
"I will say this: if Congress or the FBI does not speak the truth, it is inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the Court where it is now," said Pelosie.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Appeals Court in Washington.
Pelosie has said that as a democratic concern, it may be that Kavanaugh's decision against the Law on Access to Health Care or Roe's case against Wad is a matter for a conservative judge.
In his confirmatory hearings, Kavanaugh avoided the question whether he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical person to go to court and wait for us to say, 'Is that not wonderful?'," said Pelosie.
And the woman has to be chased.
It's a fair outcome, after months and years of verbal abuse, and it can't be expressed without a cry.
"We cry when we're angry," she said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's rare, what do you think?"
She continued: “The woman who was a directory who was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique, and that is when she was upset and started to cry, the person she was talking to said, ‘ I may be sorry because I am crying.
I'm angry.'
Then she just went on.
It seemed to me very high."
Solzes are as an exit for no part of it because people misunderstand them.
One of my most powerful memories of early careers when I was still working in the office where men were ruling, when I once found a crying in an inexhaustible rage, was when an older woman grabbed me by the door – the cold water that I was always a few times afraid to pull me to the ground.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
"They won't understand you're mad.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be happy to have you arrested."
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic Congressional from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at his presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was hit by a jump across a boat called Monkey Business and had to stand out of the game, he found that there was no reason why he could not apply for the president alone.
"This was not a well-thinked decision," I was laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the competition and another one was the last thing needed at the time.
Someone called the game 'Sneglecty and seven thumbs' at that time.'
Since the campaign was last joined, she remained in the fund-raising process, so she decided that she would not be involved in the competition if she did not collect $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave her $1,000 to a man, gave her only $250.
"But do they think I'm going to get a break?" she asked.
When she announced that she would not start an official campaign, her feelings — the gratitude of the people who supported her — were a disillusionment with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and focus on voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism - so she won to breathe.
"We'd think I'd have a nervous disorder," Schroedereva mentioned the media's reactions.
"We'd think it's my official sponsor Kleneex.
I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my wallet.
'Did she cry?'
How the war between the United States and China could take advantage of Beijing
The initial wave of trade wars between the United States and China has been shocking, and although the battle has not yet been over, experts say that it could be a long-term advantage for Beijing.
Donald Trump, the American President, launched his first warning at the beginning of the year with the taxation of key Chinese export articles, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important scalation took place this week with new commodity prices of USD 200 billion (GBP 250 billion), which effectively means taxing half of all goods coming to the United States of America from China.
Peking has been taxed at all times with equivalent return measures, at the latest at rates of between 5 and 10 per cent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China, the second largest economy in the world, has committed itself to moving around from the United States to the eye, and it is probably not going to be intertwined soon.
In order to be able to leave Washington, China would have to agree to its demands, but the US's public withdrawal from China's President Shi Jinping would be too embarrassing.
Experts say, however, that if Peking knew to withdraw the right movement, US pressure in the trade war could have long-term positive effects on China with a view to reducing the mutual dependence of both economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would lead to economic turmoil in any country is actually far more dangerous than observers have thought so far," said Abigail Grace, an expert associate who focuses on Asia's brain trust Center for new American security.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, the real Foreign Minister
Syria says it is prepared for voluntary return of refugees, and requests for assistance in the reconstruction of the country, which has been abandoned in more than seven years of war.
In the conclusion of the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moual said that the situation in the country improved.
"Today conditions in the field are more stable and safer because of the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to dream of areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normal conditions.
All the conditions are now met, for refugees who have to be left in the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures directed against their daily lives and survival.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled from the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in the reconstruction of the abandoned country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries sponsored by sponsors.
Europe won the victory at Ryder's Prize in Paris
The team of Europe won the race against the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National game in Paris in France won Ryder's win for 2018.
The United States has now lost six times on European soils, and Ryder's bid has not won since 1993.
Europe once again won the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn team reached 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
U.S. Star Phil Mickelson, who had problems with most of the priority, was trapped in the water on 16th of August in a par-3 game at his initial strike of zhogiko, which made it necessary to surrender the game to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfers Molinari spread across the circle and became one of the four players who have ever achieved a score of 5-0-0 since the beginning of the first year of 1979.
American Jordan Spieth won with 5 and 4 the lowest ranked player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 against Jan Poulter from England, who may have played last in Ryder's gifts.
The eight Ryder's gifts, Spain's Sergio Garcia, have become the most powerful European player at all times from 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help.
It was a hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas that he took me and trusted you.
So happy, I'm so happy that we won the prize again.
It's about the team and I'm really glad I can help," Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
The theme is delivered to the parents of John Ramu, who won the American legend of the Tiger Woods golf game on Sunday from 2 to 1.
"I feel incredibly proud that I was able to defeat Tiger Woods. When I grew up, I watched his games," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games he played in France, and now has a career record in Ryder's pool of 13-21-3.
This is an unusual statistics for one of the biggest players of all time who won 14 big titles, right after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been trying hard every week to find the right way, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who have played golf all the time of the entire beginning.
The U.S. captain said after a poor move for his team, "I'm so proud of these guys, they fought."
We pressed a few in Europe in the morning.
We've been down.
The clown down before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna have to get together again, I'm going to work with the American PGA and our Ryder Committee and move on.
I really like these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Head down.
We have been played.’
