Republikas' strategy against Obama
Republikas leaders have given rise to their policy of fighting against voluntary obstacles.
However, Brennan's medium-sized dividend points out that the voluntary dividend is less common in the United States than the number of people who die after the plague.
The Republicans have recently recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in the last ten years.
One is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voluntary participation.
In this sense, these measures are partly underpinned by the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, they are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And in this spirit most of the American governments have issued new laws that are difficult to process or subscribe to the electoral list since 2009.
This year, after the elections in November 2010, 675 new Republican representatives arrived in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 drafts of the law restricting voting rights in 41 countries were submitted for 2011 alone.
New electoral laws require voters to present a certificate of authenticity with the photograph and evidence of the American state population.
In addition, these laws limit the time for elections in advance, pay the right to register voters on the day of the elections and withdraw the voting rights of citizens registered in the criminal register.
Before the elections in 2006, he did not require any American state to submit a certificate of authenticity with the photograph.
The first state that made this claim was Indiana.
The Constitution of the Indian Law was confirmed in 2008 by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The Republican authorities have accelerated the extension of this procedure to other States.
In the last two years, proposals for such laws have been supported in 34 countries with a view to introducing voters to present evidence of authenticity with the photograph.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal certificate of authenticity, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, it does not own 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people of age who are allowed to vote, no evidence of authenticity with the photograph issued by the government of their state.
There is still no evidence of the identity of about five million new voters in 2012.
In addition, the requirement for a certificate of authenticity is often more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions are mainly addressed to young people, minority members and persons with low incomes.
25% of Africans, 15% of people under $35,000; 18% of citizens aged 65 years and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 are therefore not required to have a photo identity certificate.
And that's not all.
Students who, as voters, are familiar with their own example of democratic candidates are not allowed in a number of countries to use their licenses with their photo-based school.
On the other hand, the Member States will also allow members of fishing or fishing clubs who prefer more Republican candidates to use the cards issued by these clubs in their elections.
By 2004, no state in the election required a public record.
The first such request was made by Arizona.
Since 2011, about twelve states have adopted laws that establish the duty of voters to prove themselves American citizens.
These measures obviously lead to a reduction in the number of votes from the Spanish minority.
It is important to note, however, that two of the three Spanishs are giving priority to the democratic side.
The Republican legislators in 2011 supported eight laws that violated the vote on the day of the elections.
They have also limited the rights of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to write.
These restrictions have their consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general elections, the polling campaign helped to register some 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted after 2009, however, led to a decrease in the number of new voters in 2010 by 17% in 2006.
Then, in the other five countries, the Republican legislators adopted laws aimed at shortening the period for elections in advance.
For example, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of African voters who had previously voted, although African voters in this country were only 13%.
It was the same in Spain.
They created only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
On the other hand, white people, who represented 76% of all voters, formed only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Against the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters, the democratic legislators and their supporters have, of course, been placed very seriously.
Democrats have blocked several legislative proposals by their conscience.
In order to stop the application of the most controversial laws, the Attorney-General of the United States has even charged the United States.
The damage was partly limited.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted the law requiring submission of a licence.
The new rules, however, are inextricably difficult to implement voting rights in 2012.
In particular, democratic criticism speaks of the prevention of adopted laws and considers them to be a clear force to influence the outcome of the elections in the key states in 2012.
The 2011 Brennan report shows that the States where these laws were adopted represent 171 out of 270 votes in the election of voters required for victory in presidential elections.
It is too soon to declare with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have an irrevocable impact on voluntary participation.
In this sense, these measures are partly underpinned by the American democratic system.
Diabetes detection: complete the investigation or not?
The PSA test has led to slightly missing results that were not correctly negative or even negative, leading to the rest of the medical steps.
This has still increased the density of men who have been so excited to go into the investigation.
Let me check it out or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, high levels of contamination among individual tested groups were therefore difficult to interpret these findings and to make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, found a different mortality between patients who were under investigation and those who were not on it.
This study also showed after 12 years of delay that those who do not go to the study have between 30 and 40% higher risk of metastasis exposure.
I therefore recommend a 50-year-old or 40-year-old investigation if your direct neighbour had a prostitute cancer.
The most threatened group are also men of African American origin.
The key is to make the right decision when cancer is detected.
There are aggressive types of cancers and types that are ineffective.
Therefore, it is necessary to explain to the patients the risk of his or her cancer, to offer him options, to avoid the need to treat the cancer of the prostate that does not have a long-term impact on life, and to focus more on the active control of the disease in these cases.
Today, a number of men with cancer diagnosed are not treated because their cancer type is not aggressive and does not endanger them in life.
We will suggest that they have more active control and offer treatment if they are unable to progress.
More often and with greater clarity, we set out criteria that help us decide which kind to treat and which not.
However, I recommend that the examination be completed.
However, it is important to conclude a discussion with your doctor and to determine whether it is appropriate to submit the examination.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, a Movember tool was created to evaluate for and against the PSA investigation.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous procedure to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress made in the research, it seems to be the best means to reduce the risk of disease taking a sound lifestyle.
It is estimated that if all healthy people ate and moved sufficiently, up to 30% of cancer cases would occur.
"If everyone stopped smoking, this data would be at least 50%," says André Beaulie, a Canadian cancer research language company.
On the contrary, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer is caused by pregnancy.
A certain percentage also remains completely unclear.
For the Canadian cancer research company, the fight against smoking remains a priority, even if the number of smokers is broken.
Cigarettes represent 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
They are also a risk factor for a number of others.
It's incredibly harmful to human health.
"There are 1.5 million chickens still in Quebec today," says spokesman André Beaulieu.
Exciting data: 10 years after the smoke stops burning, the risk of death on the cancer of half-life is high.
Volume
Fatigue and obesity are another risk factor for disease outbreaks, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, fat tissue and endocrine, liver, kidney, and kidney.
"The research reveals that regular physical activity for the entire life of protection against cancer of fat tissue," adds the report.
Life
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of the red mass.
Too high can lead to increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is appropriate to take care of the opinions for which it is also paid.
Conserving mass by injection, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"They can cause damage to the body's cells and lead to cancer development," the report adds.
Vitamins
In recent times, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet brought a single conclusion.
Studies aimed at vitamin E are dispersible according to the SCC.
Although one of them claims to reduce the risk of cancer of prostitutes, other studies speak more about its increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not shown in detail.
Mr. Beaulie will continue to discuss how important it is to talk about your concerns and the past of your family with your doctor.
"Research doesn't mean you'll have cancer."
Higgs' boson studied
The notification of the likely occurrence of Higgs Boson called for an outbreak in the summer.
There is a view that this boson is divided into a mechanism that is responsible for all weights in the universe.
And it's also about the last part where the existence presupposes a standard model - our best or "at least bad" explanation of behaviour and behaviour - which has not been observed empirically yet.
Between physics, however, there's still no 100% certainty that it's about Higgs' boson.
There is no doubt that we have a whole new piece, which is very similar to Higgs's boss, as foretold by the standard model.
The new data published this week during the great physical convention in Kyoto is more convincing, however, there is still a lack of data in order to have absolute certainty.
However, let's assume that it's about Higgs' boson, because the risk of making a mistake is small, and let's look at what's really going on.
In this world, there is a completely inevitable law that does not allow two things to be issued at the same time at the same place.
This rule can't be ignored - and don't try too hard, otherwise you'll hurt yourself.
Even though partial physics is very strange to the world, it is shown that even in it there is a similar law: Paul's exhilarating principle, according to which two parts cannot take the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quant state" - this "state" of the group is said to create some of their properties.
Next he divides the physical particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we will find organized citizens, or farmers who obediently adhere to Paul’s principle.
And at the other end, the bosons, the under-anarchists, who don't care about anything at all, are definitely not that principle, which means they can be at the same place at the same time.
These bodies are further divided into two groups according to the device (excellently amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in the laboratories of Berkeley: the muscles that we leave here without attention, and the "strong particles", which spread a great natural force, and with which Higgs' boson is probably in some way connected.
It is necessary to say, however, that these bees are not as exotic animals as they might be imagined.
If you read this article, it's thanks to the bison with unusual banalite: photo, or "parts of light", which is an electromagnetic force.
When that part of the electric charge accelerates or changes its direction, it "screams" this electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a mask attached to the fish.
From this "restraint" comes an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultrafilament, etc.) and this wave is nothing but a photo - and then one of the bosses, "power carriers".
Stronger field
It's also with the Higgs boson, just by the difference that "smoothing" is necessary another field, the Higgs field to reveal this boson.
This Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; it needs to achieve very high energy values, like in the frozen fish's cold, which is just beginning with a very large balloon.
For this reason, it is necessary to use as large arson as the CERN accelerator in the lab - a large hadron accelerator with the impact of the collisions is a cross with a range of 27 km! - so that such energy can be generated.
Analogy with the electromagnetic field is again used to explain the relationship between Higgs and weight.
The electromagnetic field does not respond either to all parts or all of the material.
Some, for example, magnets, do it, but others don't -- the piece of paper, for example, will never hold themselves on the refrigerator.
And the same thing is that the Higgs field doesn't respond to all the parts: those who do so have a certain amount, while the rest (for example the photo, let's look at it) they don't have it.
And Mrs. Novak asks what are all these researches bringing him?
From the scientific point of view, it is about confirming the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physics to clarify any discrepancies between observation and warning.
There are few physicss too long before they can be found, because a smaller difference could open the space "new physics" and cut some memes in the model.
It should be noted that the model already has huge shortcomings, does not cause any explanation of gravity (ooha!) or dark weights that make up approximately 80% of the mass of the universe (zase oh!).
However, the CERN device has not yet been shown to date.
Odezvy
With regard to these research in your daily life, Mr and Mrs. Novak’s can only predict very difficult, but it would be a mistake to think that there will be no one.
Look: At the beginning of the 1960s, the lasers in Bellow laboratories had no idea of the revolution that had already taken place.
They predicted scientific use, but nothing else.
Physics Willard Boyle - who worked in Bell Labs, where laser was found in 1960, and who created the first steel laser paper (previous paper was pulsed) in 1962, I have already said it - laser was initially considered to be such a "labor toy".
Just imagine...
In addition, applications may also come out of all the tools that cover research.
For example, this Willard Boyle created a small light camera in 1969 during his work aimed at optics.
This photographer, even though Boyle didn't plan this at first, now serves as "like" of all digital cameras in the world and gave Nobel a price for physics in 2009.
Of course, this doesn't mean that the activities around LHC need to change our lives, but that means that a person really doesn't know...
Palliative Care - The best way to get out of life... ▸ Le Devor
The Commission has recently addressed the issue of ending life-threatening issues through its Commission on Aging.
The debate should continue slowly and at the same time come to light on a legislative proposal.
There is still much work to be done in this key area.
The magazine Le Devor tried to look at this question more detail.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Monteregie.
She's got a double-year discount from the prostitutes she's been caring for.
"They've given me five years of life and it's already seven," says without feeling on their bed in the house for the Pilateic care of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he came last day.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The poor man did his job: an unsatisfied weakness prevented him from going to the toilet alone or eating alone.
He looks intently at the chilly breakfast and agrees that we can help him eat.
He's brave and even smiles, talks to strangers who stop him, offers him drugs, offers a bathroom.
It leads to normal death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of this first, the one who humiliates me," he says.
A few hours later, the medical team found his drug problem.
"For the rest of your life, a man learns that the boy is strong," reports Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist in Victor-Gadbois's device.
Returning to the stage of the child is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the abilities of a person," says a psychologist.
According to the opinion of a number of people who are caring for palliative care, the basic moments are played in the very core of such a return.
Patients who come home with Victor-Gadbois palliative care suffer from cancer.
Their prognosis is at least three months of life.
At this stage, teams of doctors and sisters who care about them do not provide "careful" care as well.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89, the worst concern is to die "in the spirit of full knowledge".
But my illness allowed me to reveal to my children.
"I have many children," he adds.
"I have no wish in my life," she says, and then she lets us set up a breathing device.
Still, she is still happy for the next few days for the last visit of her son from Italy.
At Victor-Gadbois's home, a group of volunteers cooperates to provide body care through survival.
It looks like a palliative care that happens if you can't do anything else.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one bed of palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very small if we realize we're all going to die once.
Life continues here under optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at home.
Whether it's physical, emotional or spiritual.
When a person dies, for example, he can be given a shower of brandy or peppers, according to the taste.
Diabetes don't have to watch the cold sugar anymore.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, they sent a beer to Mr. X., who died later that night.
He's drinking his son's beer this morning at the honor of his father-in-law.
"We are helping patients as close as they are," reports Nathali Savard, director of the Pachete Service.
In Victor-Gadbois' house, the days go by one another, but they don't like each other.
According to a 13-year-old man who is happy with his family from the last meeting, who is basically represented by the police, while contributing to his honour, a tragic six-year-old man, surrounded by his parents, his wife, and two small children, dies tragically after he has tried all the opportunities to survive.
"There have always been three to five beds for people with cancer for up to 45 years," reports Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients who come to Victor-Gadbois's home come here from their homes, 47% from the hospital.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care that is intended to ease the patient's suffering as long as he gets into the final phase of his life, whether he's home, hospital or bakery.
And a number of organisations, such as Victor-Gadbois's homes and the Grand Montreal Family for domestic palliative treatment, are more highly specialized in the care of oncological patients.
And just this fundamental lack of access to medical care in Quebec leads to the fear that a number of doctors specialized in palliative care are afraid of adopting the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Already since October, there has been a manifesto signed by spies in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their disagreement with such initiatives.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebecn medical system is not effective enough to ensure access for all persons to quality palliative care until it is possible to agree with the implementation of euthanasia.
As she says, she recently had a patient who spent 14 days preparing for major diseases without anyone taking the necessary steps to get rid of her.
It is feared that patients will not ask for death because they do not receive adequate care.
And at the same time, it pays for a number of oncologists to care for their patients until the last minute regardless of the unfavourable prognosis.
Hope for Hélène Richard's survival was already completely minimal when she gave up the prescribed chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to end my treatment, she said she was sorry I stopped fighting, she'd tell us.
And then she told me it was over!
No strong care
Dr. Martel suggests that 90% of the patients who wish to die are grateful to their healers for not meeting their wishes when their palliative pike has healed them.
But it is necessary to say that palliative care is not necessarily powerful in the treatment of disease.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care in the Grand Montréal community for domestic palliative care, patients are avoiding treatment in 8% of cases.
At the same end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives that the patient can achieve until the end of the day, whether it has been given intravenously or with sedatives.
We can't pretend we don't take this part of suffering.
A patient we don't cure will have an even greater chance of accessing palliative sedatives.
Patients who are not given sedatives always say, "I want to die".
But it doesn't always have to mean "I want you to give me euthanasia," which means "I want you to heal me."
The implementation of this report has enabled journalists from the Canadian Institute for Medical Research.
Wider actual scans in Quebec
Road management officials, construction and public works, lobbyist political parties and experts on the Italian Mafia continue to report what they know of a wonderful "system", where buildings, state officials, politicians, councils and mafia are organized.
This "obor" came to Quebec's taxpayers very dear, especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system has broken apart since we adopted the basic measures," said Iranian Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebecan ambassador and former chief of police in Montreal.
Thanks to him, in 2011, he launched a scandal on the basis of a follow-up investigation aimed at the acquisition of funds in relation to the construction of a railway in Quebec, which the former liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest approved for long periods of time.
The "Duchsneau's report" confirmed a direct link between industry, non-transparent funding and corruption of government officials.
"Just since the start of the survey in 2010,," she says, "the Ministry of Transport has only visited the Department of Transport on Billions of Dollars," when some people have held back their instincts to get part of them!
Charbonneau's commission "who has brought the two-year-olds down," adds hope that she will be able to "discover some people's greed".
Permanent unit for combating corruption based in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011 is also involved in the fight against its army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
In addition to this, the Marteau Police, who have ensured since 2009, that the exhibition's "moneycard" will clearly reduce the ban...
In the past few weeks, they have carried out a series of inspections and have complained of the confusion and corruption of a number of general representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, an elderly town in the province.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his role as the oldest town of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec.
It is suspected that he was re-submitted to pay for public contracts.
The formal charges have also been received by transport engineers from Montreal and operators of the Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito called for a sensation when the Commission explained the mechanism to "system" to obtain public orders.
He committed himself during these years to 3% of the value of the ban that he received in Montreal, to the media associated with the Mafia, who then transferred the money to Union Montreal, as senior candidate Gérald Tremblay.
Zambito was a witness on all sides after 2000 and owed over $88,000 of Canadian dollars (about EUR 68 000) to provincial parties, especially to liberals who were in power at the time.
He also acknowledged that he organized an illegal financial hearing for former liberal vice-president Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with money-producing prices
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked very closely.
Gilles Surprenant, former transport engineer, described it in a very detailed manner before the Commission: during ten years he received from construction companies gifts, invitation to travel, golf tournaments, to restaurants, hockey sports and cashiers at a value of nearly $736,000 instead of cash contracts at his price.
Other public operators from the transport sector admitted that they were allowed to pay compensation for over 30% to 40% overestimating invoices through unfair increases.
The organizer of the senior party, Martin Dumont, then accused Tremblaye of imputing his eyes to the previous budget, which he had brought with him a spy money.
On the basis of these findings, Tremblay left early in November, which Montréal threw into the vast crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first demonstrators who issued a warning signal.
As the old Rivière-des-Prairies on the east of the island, since 2010, it has been against the sale of the current land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million promoters directly in the midst of the rising trade with property.
70% of spinach money in voluntary campaigns
The investigation that will finally begin says that "there is no one in the effort to understand the functioning of the inspired movement system in order to stop the gangrene and suppress the guilty."
The process is, according to it, "serious, but mild."
We are in the wound cleaning phase, but it is necessary to set up our own investigation unit in Montreal and ensure that these wrong practices cannot be returned.
It's like he's getting involved.
Right.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have printed hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly afraid of the role of "the messengers who have been informed about this letter" if they have not joined those checks!
It's estimated that 70% of the funding for voluntary campaigns in Quebec comes from Spanish money, and with irony, it adds: "I've heard that it's only a bad deal of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit the contributions to the parties to $100, but it does not address this situation: "Until the electoral expenditure is strictly limited, the money will not disappear from politics."
It proposes a comprehensive control of the system of awarding public procurement and financing of the party: "We can't go wrong anymore; if we focus on the basis of things, we can build on stronger foundations and with greater control and compliance with the laws."
If this story turns the picture of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchessneau recommends everyone who laughs at him to look at his own court...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
In this season you and the PSG have set up a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
You can explain to her that all individuals went to themselves, or just a new PSG dimension.
Great players came to us.
Every day, I'm getting along with them.
The technical team has helped me a lot.
Every day these facts allow me to raise the level of the game.
And it's easier at the game.
It's all going very fast in the football.
I'm not losing my head.
From the beginning of my preparation at INF Clairefontaine until after I moved to Saint-Etienne, I always thought about the individual stage.
So you're using the competitive environment that Carlo Ancelotti launched...
Powers from this year are used to playing games at a very high level.
He also knows that every trainer is fundamental.
And it turns out that a player like me has more desire to run and wants to do the maximum performance.
And besides, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot of attention to my position.
He's got his hands on his hands, like Claude Makelele, who's playing at the same position as me.
And has Ancelotti got the right word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has respect for all the techniques.
Today there is no equal in the 1st league and is one of the best European coaches.
He's got huge experience and he's got a lot of titles with the spy teams.
He also worked with outstanding players.
I think he's playing another title in Paris.
In January, I had a comfortable conversation with him.
I had a lot of injuries behind me.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my effectiveness.
How do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
On 1st July, Lyon picked us up the head position.
But we're still in custody.
One of our main objectives is the League of Masters: we've come to the eighth level very easily.
What's your club's purpose in this competition?
We're trying to go as far as possible.
It can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a hard fight for the quality of the European team.
First, we want to win our qualified group in front of Port so we can play in the eight-year-old home.
Can PSG be in a short-term horizon with a large European club?
It's time to start counting on it.
To become a big European club, Paris has to win titles and write into history.
It's not like that today.
On the financial page, the PSG has the means to achieve this objective.
And would it be a great failure not to win in 1st league as in the late summer season?
Of course, that would be a great defeat.
This year, we really want to win the league title.
We've missed enough in the late summer season.
We were lying in May because we had to win.
We had a great season.
We've collected 79 points.
It's usually paid that with 79 points, you're a clear master...
Only another club, Montpellier, had a season more wonderful.
I think this year's gonna work out.
Although the title is being moved by large teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think we have a weapon available to defeat them.
You think the PSG media are expecting too much?
It's not unusual to expect us much in view of what invested here and what players we have.
That's exactly what we're gonna do.
It's the fact that if we break Troyes 4:0 at home and there's still something we read in the news, it's not quite pleasant.
The man asks what people can want more from you.
Of course, it's not gonna win 4:0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up herring style.
You need time to build a team.
We found out at the master's League that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, which was no longer in the second season of the eight-year term, and they also invested large amounts!
In view of the invested sums, it would be possible to expect you to have the rest of the 15 points hit!
That's where you attack the other clubs and the French league.
Lyon and Marseille clubs, which did not happen too much in the late summer season, joined the new PSG in the next phase.
This shows how great the 1st league is.
I hope we'll be able to laugh in May and say that despite all the difficulties, we have been able to win.
It seems like the PSG depends on the execution of Zlatana Ibrahimovica.
It's good to say there's a "dependence on Zlatana."
This means that Abrahamic is very effective and that he gives a lot of heads.
That's why he came here and showed that he's a star number one.
Wherever he went, he proved he's a big player, the world star.
We respect people and players in our team.
And he respects the people around him.
What he's got is really extraordinary.
This led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, who belongs to the world's best defenders, also makes it possible for others to grow beside themselves.
How did you survive the Euro 2012 with the French representative?
It's like a breakdown.
I really wanted to play this tournament.
I'm sorry I couldn't play the way I imagined.
But I survived, and I got out of it stronger.
Today, I'm also allowed to play good games in the representation.
And that's what I've been hoping for from my way to the representation.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to be exemplary.
How do you look at the first month of Didier Deschamps in front of the national team?
He's talking about the results.
We're in a good position to qualify for MS.
The coach will choose exactly, he will be close to the players and will be able to climb for victory.
That's what Laurent Blanc was like.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc reached his goal of qualifying for the euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will take our team to Brazil.
Is the remiza (1:1) from October 16th in Spain a solid outlet?
This game has given us a sense of self-consciousness.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I didn't have such a game for my career.

All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and costs for processing between recipients.
As these technologies are often true, there is a clear political perspective: the conviction that the existing financial system based on banking monopolies leads to the financial crisis.
Bitcoin, whose finder is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudo) represents both virtual money (relative to dollar, euro...), such a secure translation protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between two partners.
With 15 000 computers connected to the network, some 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as payment means.
The bitcoin course first reached a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later it was 2 dollars, and today it is moving to a limit of about $10 (the course view is listed on the bitcoincharts.com page).
Compared to the world's exchange of real money or financial products, this is not a big deal.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual funds that came out in October.
Bitcoin refers to "the most successful virtual money", "competitive dollar and euro" and "the period of ordinary money".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual money because it's like "credit" used for the video game process that a person gets game or can buy (and easily change it again).
The Facebook social network has also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the central authority shall monitor and process individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all depositors of ordinary accounts, controllers, issuers of money and buyers and sellers are posted online.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses.
However, the user can choose another address for each payment that ensures anonymity.
The transaction information board is electronically signed by the encryption system with the double key.
The network can verify the validity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is still possible to ensure that changed bits exist in a public book of ordinary accounts distributed throughout the network.
The key phase starts in writing this new transaction into this book.
It shall be used to resolve the mathematical task of the computer assigned to which the solver, as a temporary central banker, shall have the right to write this additional line.
It is about the file resolution phase, i.e. the conversion of the size file to a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers "transmit" this new transaction and add the number to it, first and then the whole "square".
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific print (depends on the beginning).
As soon as this number is found, the other opinions are easy to control.
The transaction will then appear indestructibly linked to the network of all other transactions; any adjustment would be made to change the print.
If the user wants to pay twice the same money immediately after him (up to 10 minutes), the network will confirm only one of the two transactions - the other will be released because each of them has a different print.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this compensation will be paid regularly by two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is so limited by 21 million, but it can be divided up to 20 million, so the margin space is here...
The difficulty of the task also increases from an increasing level of calculation.
The network's already been running its way down and down.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and have been printed by the posted Bitcoins.
"The used debt is not a separate protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who established Paymium, a company for real money payments that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the possibility of paying spinal money through this anonymous service.
But this problem is also a matter of urgency.
Great players like Wikipedia reject the gifts of this attitude.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, are accepted.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizman Constitution recently analyzed the book of ordinary accounts in Israel and showed that almost 80% of the Bitcoins do not exist.
In November, the "obroves" were launched.
"Three thousand dollars was exchanged," said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who lives in turning bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the pedagogical books on these money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a trading network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent credit card (with real money) or without contacting his mobile, but he uses Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are easier.
In addition, the wearer adjusts his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easily established in traders where new terminals or software are not needed.
It's enough to send an address that can be "photographed and identified" by Pierre Noizat, who guarantees that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement towards the failure of hierarchical systems and the transition to more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin passes, it's still running, but 2013 could be decisive," he predicts.
In its report, the ECB also proposes to assess the various risks that are considered to be increased today if such money is to be successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
The French authorities have abandoned their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Capis and Surobie).
NATO and US units should follow up at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of their territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not all of us.
The biggest prize has been endured by people on the Afghan coast, which we have persecuted, because we considered them terrorists.
And we've come with 88 dead soldiers, and all of you hurt and freeze.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former leading representatives who fled to Pakistan, but it is often about aliens who refuse the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though they have been added to them by the Jedi, the Pakistani, the Arab, the Uzbek, the Tadzik.
Now they use tolerance and often the help of local supporters, but if Western forces are to be lifted, their support will weaken.
The departure of the French units from the foundation of Nijrab, which I was watching from the tops of the mountains of Mandlons, thanks to the French loans, has been organized.
Cars and tanked vehicles arrived in Kabul without an attack on the air transport of the helicopter.
Since the end of 2014 the Taliban will no longer be so active in Kabul.
The conditions have changed significantly from their unstoppable process in 1994 to 1996.
The Cabul was now empty, and the land was in blood and fire as a result of wars between various armed groups.
Their taking over control over the country was then considered to be a type of liberation, a return to safety.
The Afghans paid the price for the plight of these refugees, who were completely governed by Al-Ká'ida, but their situation has not improved until our time.
In some cases, the Afghan government and the current Taliban agree to keep women in a position of subjection.
The main winners of the war against Soviet units returned in 2001 to power.
They became heads of State, sold as building lands for refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge American restrictions on subcontractors.
They were disappointed; most of them were not even at war.
According to what I've heard in the campaigns, people complain about the government that they won't make any more evil.
A number of young people want to leave like those who have been able to use American fortunes: capitalism is important.
Young people are already losing the war and associated ideology.
During the exile in Iran or Pakistan, the modern world was recognized and its benefits were realized.
About 65% of the population is younger than 25 years; there are currently 5 million inhabitants in Kabul, the fifth population.
In cities, public schools are full, girls and boys are going there.
This young people will need to be given work, which they no longer want to return to the misery of the past or to the corruption of some representatives.
All, including armed opposition, enjoy mobile phones; televisions and Turkish series that show the modern world follow everywhere.
The army is already there.
Will the authorities that will be placed in her head be considered legitimate?
Some of the greatest battles against the Soviet army are already being renewed by provincial militias that will be out of control of the Central Force.
Afghanistan, which has a strong influence on local identity, should enjoy certain measures of decentralization following the example of Western states, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralised state with a strong presidential influence, so it had become a breach of the status of the prime minister that had existed since the adoption of the Constitution in 1964.
President Karzáí does not want foreign controls, especially when the elections scheduled for April 2014 are available.
However, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the early 1950s.
No industry has been able to recover, no prize is working, no basic system is fixed.
Everything is brought in; nothing is made with it, but fruit and vegetables.
He has a private initiative.
The three decades of war destroyed in the country would require government control of infrastructure.
It was reported that Afghanistan had vast wealth.
And it just felt like Western states were here just to strengthen her.
Without energy for the processing of iron or steel on the ground and without means of transporting raw materials across the mountains, there is no difficulty in growing up.
The Chinese have already left the role of Mes Aynak and have left the international archeological teams (for the support of the World Bank) with the possibility of exploring a vast Buddhist area to preserve the role of the largest employee in the entire province.
One day it will also be necessary to restore normal relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which is largely dependent on imports and exports.
The departure of French war units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement proposes the continuation of the usual types of assistance: girls and boys lycea, French universities, French institutes, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, she has worked on the initiative to "get a heart and soul" trying to imitate the immediate task of pursuing aid and military activities, in which the service of the "citizen-military steps" Ministry of Defence, which was abolished in 2012, but has been achieved thanks to the countless French non-governmental organization of success in the area of common interest and agricultural reconstruction in ten mountain villages.
This work, involving the number of local workers, helped to slow down the rise: packaging, steam, drinking water, heating, fruit trees, soil protection and expansion of the processing area.
What do we remember about two billion euros of military expenditure?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very convenient in these areas, which are often at sea altitudes of over 2,000 m.
The majority received dozens of written applications for small agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free these farmers from the rebellion of the leading foreign groups, they wish, in their own words, to achieve impartial civil assistance in their benefits, which would be properly controlled and directly affected.
Hard work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Mursi left for another party of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided country in its history because of the declaration of the Constitution, which temporarily confers unlimited power on it, it decided to play a vampire.
In the middle, he announced without prejudice to the opinion of all the others that the Constitutional Assembly agreed to a final amendment tomorrow.
A few weeks ago, the Head of State made this meeting two months later for the completion of the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using the provisional text, which has been repeatedly supplemented, which weakens the constitutional stability of the country and leads to legal agreements.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the country's well-being.
In view of the opposition, the president remains in his "autocratic delirie", he continues to "reject his word" and "response his right".
His supporters, however, are convinced that it is about how quickly to cope with the constitutional and political crisis and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be concluded in two weeks.
It is a very short time to bring the Brethren away from the purpose of the text to explain the article after the article.
The President is also talking about how to regain national and democratic legitimacy while the country as a whole rejects protests.
As confirmed in the discussion for the American Week of Time, Muhammad Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.
In particular, because this rapidly organised vote puts the people of Egypt before the ultimate: " either accept my text or let me leave unlimited powers", which should otherwise end after the adoption of the new constitution.
And in this special atmosphere yesterday, 85 Members of the so-called constitutional meeting with a large majority of Islamists adopted the text.
Most liberals failed when voting.
In mid-November, shortly before the declaration of the Constitution, they knocked on the door because they could not put their views to the test.
Human rights defenders, civil society, or members of religious minorities have made their steps similar.
In order to achieve accountability, 11 persons from a number of donors were quickly added yesterday.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim brotherhood.
It is not surprising then that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
The commentators continued to argue that one of the few disputes that day ran around... hours for prayer when some members of the committee held the view that the hours in the sitting room were not properly arranged.
The text on which it was voted yesterday evening is drawn up in 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, is finally in line with the 1971 version of the Constitution and states that "the rules of the law of the courts are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the implementation of Islamic law is one of the fundamental requirements, hoped that it would replace the term "law" with the term "rules", which would allow for greater application.
For Islam, the fact that this article has not been corrected is a sign of their good will and respect for the rest of the Egyptian society.
"Procedure" is intended by liberals who see only a linguistic problem.
According to them, the Islamicization of the Constitution is carried out through other articles.
They shall, in particular, refer to Article 220, which confers on the University of Al-Azhar the advisory role, in particular on issues of law enforcement.
According to the expert at Egypt Sophie Pommier, it is reassuring because "people called for expression are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can look at the beginning of the theocracy."
The concerns of liberals are even more confusing than the fact that the next Rector of the university should be less moderate than the present one.
"Now there has been no specific religious consequence.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not useful, but university workers, a number of them have studied in French schools," Alexis Blueet, who prepares for the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, it agrees that "there may be disputes regarding the interpretation of Article 220, since the terms used therein are part of the religious dictionary.
This is particularly the reference to "fiqh" [Islamic legal knowledge, Mr. Red.].
And in the future, a question may arise, to what extent civil judges are competent to express themselves."
Yesterday, the text approved was highly criticised in addition to religious sites because of the powers extended to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brotherhood insists that there has been a marked restriction on the former regime.
Another peaceful place: the power of a trusted army.
In accordance with the wishes of the representatives of the army, the audit of the draft defence budget will not be carried out by Parliament, but by the National Defence Council.
Then there will be no ban on the treatment of civilians in military courts, as required by the Association for the Protection of Human Rights.
These associations speak in connection with the text that they consider to be against freedom, about their own shortcomings.
The third act of redundancy is maintained and the strike is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
There is no article on the protection of women anymore, highlighting Heba Morayef's Human Rights Watch organization.
According to it, the only clear point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous sentence.
While the Egyptian President had to appear on television last night, the events scheduled to take place this afternoon.
Then the heads of state will show up on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the world’s poppy and sea from a salty salt solution
The land of promise is linked to the size of Bible truth, modern comfort, and the lack of natural resources.
AaF has identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Communicating With the Holy Place
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that for all who enter into this “laugh, ” there is God’s mercy.
And Galilee was the place of Jesus ’ miracles: the change of water into wine for the wedding, the pool of water, the comforts of the storm, and the filling of the net.
Here Jesus also appeared to his disciples and after his resurrection.
But most holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers here will suffer on the road or suffer on the path of Jesus Christ (Latin Via Doloros).
It begins with the courage of Antonia - Pretoria - where the court is held, passes through the streets of Old City and leads to the temple of God's tomb on Mount Golgot - to the place of burial stone and place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian doll of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The church of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was established in a place where according to the Christian legend a tree was grown from which the cross was made to Jesus ’ cross.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place for the Jews - Now the temple remains, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, people from all walks of life leave notes with wishes to be fulfilled.
Lower Path Vertically
The word of strength of Masada remained secret before the enemy, whom Herod the Great set up in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
The nest is located on the slopes in the mountains at a sea height of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who live in hot weather can get their own strength.
The rest of this historic mountain is bringing the wolf out.
And on the north side of the country is a well-known mountain range of 1600-2040 m, which is located in the middle of Hermon, which is located in the winter months of a large number of tourists.
To this forest paradise, tourists are transporting tourists from the head of a cable bus.
The entire length of mountain seats is 45 km.
According to ancient legends, they lived on high mountains in the realm of the gods.
Visit the unique museum
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit all of them during one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely the visitors.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near Knesset (Parliament).
It contains an ancient Kumran manuscript or testimony from the Dead Sea, which was found in the Greek Jewish desert, and some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The art museum is also located in Tel Aviv.
In its exhibition are the most widely represented and expressed coins, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkono you can visit the Al Basha Museum, which shows visitors several rooms of old Turkish bathrooms with figures of laser and laser healers from that time.
There is a unique private Ralli museum in Caesarea, where you can admire the salts of Dalí and Rodena.
There's no guide here, no funerals.
It's free access and gifts are strictly rejected.
The fifth museum - The Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - reports about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - Children's Memorial - was based on the memory of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You're going inside - and you're going to get out in the dark.
The stars are falling apart.
And the names of the children of Judah and the names of the country where they were buried.
Ukraine has also been introduced.
Improve Your Health
Israel’s three main Laser centers are located on the Mediterranean, the Red and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers pools, aqua park, delfinary and oceanary.
It is interesting that in the Red Sea it can be bought in winter months because the water temperature is not below 21 degrees Fahrenheit [21 ° C] and the air is warm to 23 degrees Fahrenheit [23 ° C].
The dead sea is even hotter, and people buy it all year.
The dead sea is by far the most special sea in the world, located in the lowest firmy point of the planet - 417 m below sea level.
Azuro water in it is a salt solution that easily keeps cool and people who are unable to swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealisticly beautiful.
Make sure that you are treated with salty water - salts, and a medicine bag that can treat your health problems with dermatitis, allergy, asthma, eczema, arthritis, constipation, diabetes, to treat your loved nerves.

Protecting her was an old part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean Coast.
Through them she passed the glorious sea route of Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The features of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is the place where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, which together survived a long and happy life.
Tourists love the tastes of narrow streets named after the signs of the beast.
It's said that if you press the walls in the street "your" sign, you'll be lucky enough.
In Jaffa, you may meet new arrivals from all over Israel and even from other countries to allow them to take pictures.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can pass through the Roman theater and "get" the strength of the circles.
In Roman times Caesar was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pilate Pontius Pilate.
A well-constructed theatre is used for evening concerts and operas today.
Tourist, in dictionary
If you come to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: about 30% of the Russian population is speaking in this country.
On the way, it is better to take money away from yourself, not in euros, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for shoes (now about $1 is about 3.8 check).
The city transport is mainly busier, but in Jerusalem there is a speedy tram and in the city of Haifa is the only line of foot in the country with six stations that connect the lower city with the mountain.
It's basically the underground lava road.
Traveling to all types of urban public transport is 6 bicycles for which you can drive 1.5 hours by driving.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath was celebrated.
From Friday evenings to the west of the sun on Saturday, it ceases to work on markets, shops and public transport.
And Sunday morning begins a week's work.
In many coffee shops, restaurants and hotels, you will only get a cup of food: with the exception of grape mass, marine fruits, fish without soup and food containing the combinations of milk and meat.
They offer a great choice of foods from the pineapple and honey, herbs and deserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish cheese hummus, the most diverse kinds of vegetables, cyclists from yellow - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no dogs in the streets of Israel.
That's why there's a lot of stuffed cats here that's thankfully "tossed by their taste."
In the evening hours you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Surviving cats love frozen places and feel free to do any good.
The car rental will be based on the car's mark of 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 dollars per day (Audio A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - $15 per day.
And renting a bike will be about 15 shillings a day.
The entrances to the museum are approximately 30 shekels.
Numeric point
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Getting to know the country and rest has come from most citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The country's promised visit from January to October 2012 to 118,8 000 Ukrainian tourists, 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the 9th of February 2011.
"Great and strong" will be announced in Moscow: immigrants will save money in their own language
While MPs and human rights defenders still debate the law on mandatory language tests, there have already been found in the country by subcontractors who sell "departed" certificates
Each year 13 million foreign workers arrive in Moscow, Petrohrad and other Russian cities.
Most of them are Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support the family home.
On 1 December, he entered into force on the law, whereby each migrant worker will be obliged to make a test of the knowledge of Russian.
In the meantime, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, the FMS promises that the relevant tests will be time-bound for all visitors.
However, the tests will be based not only on language knowledge but also on Russian history and on the principles of law.
Language skills will also need to be confirmed to obtain and extend labour permits.
The exception is only for citizens of a country where Russian is the official language.
This law does not apply to any people who have successfully obtained a certificate and obtained an academic degree in the collapse of the SSSR in 1991.
Use, assessment and protection of rights
The network of experimental sites will work under the auspices of the Russian-language Foundation of Puškin, the National Friendship University, the Moscow State University, the State University of St. Petrohrad and other Russian high schools.
Migrants can run tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres have been opened in Russia today.
The initiative to support the implementation of the testing was also supported by the Member States' MPs and the FMS (Federal Migration Services).
But before the law came into force, the defenders of human rights were able to put them in the press a question: what does it really bring?
What will change the responsibility to know the language for Russia and for its visitors?
So above all - responsible representatives of migration services - it is possible to reduce the number of people who suffer as a result of "the child labour."
Many people today talk about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the president of the FMS Russia presidency in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be started before their departure.
Only a system of organised meetings will allow 90% of the problems of foreign workers to be solved.
Problems arise in migrants without a call, without education, who do not know the language and have no medical examination.
Without knowledge of language - says Sebelev's conviction - the future migrants are condemned to shootings with bad people who, with the help of the help of him, will ensure a "show" for the next, solid accommodation in which he and dozens of others, such as he himself, spend months without food and documents and walk for 12 to 14 hours a day.
From our migrant workers, we get a lot of trouble.
"They promise them one in their possession, but when they come, they'll have their passports, they won't pay their pledges," confirms the Chief Tax Administration of Labour Migration MS Tolib Sharipov.
Don't give up!
Rather, many citizens of the Central Asian Republic, who are planning to work in Russia, recognize that they not only know the language of the country they want to get, but have no experience at all with the work done.
Of course, this is not even their wines, such as the most unfortunate: only very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tadiks can afford to get at least an adequate basic education.
However, their families also need something to feed their children, not just the fact that they need to be well dressed, fed and trained in school.
As children grow into productive age, they have to work on their first chance.
Without knowing the language, it's hard - they admit it.
"You feel low and low."
It is true that in view of the law on language experiments, the protection of human rights is one of the most important things.
The test will only be carried out by migrants who have legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't have any tests, nor will they get any other official work.
In the meantime, most migrant workers live as illegally as they used to in Russia.
"By the way, or by the forbidden entry."
Many coming workers claim that gaining official status in our country is not easy at all.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and all those language problems.
Legalizations are also money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police officers know that we have basically false documents, without registration, and that is why we have a case of excavating.
"Requires a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," he shared his experience with journalists from Tajikistan's town of Umed Chuškadamov.
"Come on, don't be soft, buy yourself a ball."
On the first day of the application of the language law, it was found that counterfeits were not just documents of migrants on registration.
The FMS staff have already taken a number of false testimony on language testing.
Shared evidence is printed on the usual colour paper.
Of course, the new owners did not get free: each of the migrants in hopes that they would be so easy to complete the tests that they paid for this document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times higher than the completion of the official test: this will become a migrant worker of three thousand rubles.
The main task of the nearest future is to ensure a system against corruption so that workers cannot simply buy evidence, in which government officials and human rights defenders agree.
Government authorities can still promise foreign workers who did not have the first test time to complete a course of basic Russian language.
For visitors who do not have the skills of Russians, work is expected in areas where there is no need for active contact with people.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not take part in the illegal arms market
The share of criminal acts using legally held weapons is very low
MVD Russia submits a proposal to strengthen the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of government authorities to recent events: the incident of shootings on non-victimated weddings and a massacre prepared by Moscow's lawyer Dimitria Vinograd, resulting in the disappearance of seven people.
The police want to prohibit the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which they can obtain a license to carry weapons - from 18 to 21 years.
This opinion supports the head of the Security Council Committee and the fight against the corruption of Irina Jarova, which promised that the amendments to the arms law would be submitted by the State Council in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian state authorities are trying to solve the problem of the road to "shrubing".
In the network, an open letter was published by the authors - representatives of various community shooting organizations - calling for the rejection of the "unreasonably direct" law.
The percentage of fraud with registered weapons is minimal, Vasili Lesnikov, a lawyer and a criminal in a discussion with the Russian editor BBC.
According to the Ministry of the Interior statistics, 142 criminal acts were recovered in six months in 2012 using the armed forces of the Ministry of the Interior, while at the same time a total of 1168 thousand criminal acts were committed.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the enforcement of the legal provisions in the field of civilian weapons does not accept the defendants to move into the "black" market.
According to them, at present there can be found a low priced voluntary weapon in Moscow.
At present, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Addendums: from race to race by officer
"Black" arms market is equipped with several channels.
The main channels are five, says Colonel Victor Baranèc, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General State.
Screenshot page that accepts weapons orders
The first one of them - "military or military road", means a weapon that was fired during the Kavkaze wars.
"The weapons have also stolen officers and their own cavities," Baranèc says.
Other types of "black weapons" are weapons stolen by criminals in security forces.
Baranec explains that there are also thefts from police funds and weapons stolen directly from officials of the authorities involved in criminal proceedings.
Unlawful "mainly" get to the sale of military funds.
In many military reserves it often comes to explosions.
"It has been shown that some fires have been deliberately set up - so that the lack is so hidden," said former soldier.
They make their contribution in accordance with the words of Barance and the arms manufacturer.
"At present, private arms companies that are not competitive on the international market are emerging and are producing weapons that are being delivered to the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
Another source of the black market is hunting.
In particular, a large number of guns and cars come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There's their product, sometimes weapons are produced here in small arms, and it's caused by the mafia that organized their oil production," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun?
The panellists figured out what is a close part of the individual sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
The report on this problem was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for the Analysis of Problems and Design of Public Administration.
The experts reviewed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, the criminal literature and the data of the public data portals focused on weapons.
Most illegal weapons are carried out by researchers, from military and executive authorities.
Half of all weapons have appeared on the black market "the guilt of official workers whose work is linked to weapons," says the report.
According to data available to researchers, 17% of armed conflict weapons have occurred in 14% of cases in the manufacture of weapons, 5% is "black archeology".
The seller-consultant of one of the arms dealers who asked us not to introduce his name is convinced that the weapons found in black "archeologists" have not been bought for a long time - they are just too old.
Most often, as he says, salesmen drive for new deposits right into military funds.
Through the trailer, the interested party buys a unit, such as the TT gun.
You order a gun to him and he sells it to you across the board.
"This will take her to the city and sell her for 900 euros for a cup of tea with two containers," she says.
"The fact is that the police are well in the picture, and that is why whenever they start to burn a plan in the explanation of criminal acts, they do control purchases in dealers with illegal weapons," he adds.
"As in the luxury shop"
The sellers with the most frequently purchased are found through their acquaintances.
I visited websites and blogs until the guy who offered me the opportunity to go to the "Temporarily" platform, where he would be the man who would lead me to the "Question", where we would go together.
I've learned most of the price until I get there.
Military report Viktor Baranèc
If I want to get a gun, I need a known guy who knows the way out, he's gonna tell the salesman - a consultant. - I have a well-known guy, but I don't trust him.
The sellers on the market are, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr Ivan Ivanovic, who asked me to make sure that the daughter had a tooth."
And now I'm gonna get through the man I'm sure of.
He also gives them to me only because he knows I don't give it.
Beginners are looking for weapons in various ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baraníc tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-90s when he was preparing for publication on this subject.
The schematics have not changed according to his word.
He gave him a photo album where it was "all you've thought about."
"I felt like a luxury shop," the soldier recalls.
The buyer, according to Baranèce, does not offer any interest in the search - you can try everything.
I, the potential client, I just don't buy - we're going with the salesman into the forest and we're gonna set up a target.
"They give me the chance to shoot, and when I'm sure that the gun is going to shoot well, we start to run," says the expert's procedure.
Reconnaissance box
Searchers will bring you online to websites and groups on "Vkontaktu", where you will be offered to buy weapons "for various purposes".
There is no need for documents or personal meetings.
"It's enough to have a fixed amount of money," they write in a commercial title on the website "Buy a fight gun or auto".
On these sites users leave their notifications and ask questions.
What about selling cheap?
"Of course, without a license," the user "Ivan" is asked.
"I'm buying TT.Moscova" - it's specifically formulated the "Fedorenkov" requirement.
The Federal Security Service has recently decided a vast network of web sites and individuals who wish to buy military weapons can collect a thief.
People laugh like hungry fish on the beach and then get oil on Siberia.
Military report and senior military commander Viktor Baranovic
I have heard of such schemes: websites are usually registered for limitations of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer will make payment through the banks.
"In response to this, the seller sent him a photo and a description of the direction where the weapon is hidden," reports the press spokesman of the non-governmental organization "Right to Arms" Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranovic confirms that following orders are posted on websites, you can remain unarmed and run away from the networks.

Macarov for $100
If you buy illegal firearms, you will pay the amount normally from $100 to 900.
According to Dmitrije Kislov of the non-governmental organization "The Right to Arms" you will arrange Makarov's guns for $100 to 300.
You have to wait until one and a half months.
The weapons shall be dispatched from funds to long-term storage through the funds of the medium Article.
According to the official statistical authority, compared with the winter period, in October 2011 the number of these criminal acts in Russia decreased by 7%, by 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of reported thefts and shootings, shootings, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, fast food workers and supermarkets are being set up
"McDonald" works on a follow-up to the fourth of all American teenagers.
In the last few days, there was a wave of protests in America against the low walls in Walmart's hypermarkets and in the restaurants of popular fast entertainment contests, such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave changes to the ninth wave, or if it's just about to disappear soon.
All of this is supported by the committees and a number of left-wing community organisations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages that are received by workers in Walmart and in rapid distribution systems, the aim of protest organizers is to achieve their creation in their committee organisations.
At present, this economic sector is practically not affected by the committee's momentum.
46 cents a year?
Actions began last week after the day of thanksgiving, in a so-called "black Friday", when the organ of cheap products was attacked in America, millions of people were arrested and, in some cases, were also executed by robbers.
On that day, some Walmart workers, who work for 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs and demonstrated together with the teams and left-wing activists of the international trading companies whose goods are destined for people of lower and middle classes.
Walmart sells all over the world, from filling through the hunting rifles and car batteries to after the excavator, eggs and milk.
The products in its sales range from 8% to 27% lower than in large supermarkets.
That's why many employees with low wages in Walmart's sales are only buying themselves at work.
The availability and Sorting of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can allow himself to sell goods so easily partly because he only pays his employees a little.
They also suffer from poor working conditions, such as lack of automatic vehicles or manual scanners.
The demonstrators called for an increase in wages and complained that the health insurance costs provided by companies increased from $30 to $100 per month.
Typical Walmart employee gets $9.5 per hour, but it doesn't answer the costs, employees say.
Researchers at the University of California in Berkeley point out that if Walmart increases the average interest to $12 per hour, it will be a government $3.2 billion a year.
It's about 1.1% higher than this company is currently paying.
If Walmart moves an increase of half to the consumer level, each visit to the sale will be only 46 cents more.
This year, customers lose about $12,39 more than today.
Walmart's advocates point out that the protest was carried out only in nine countries and that the company should not cause practical harm.
"Black Friday" in sales companies lasted from 8 o'clock on Thursday to midnight the following day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5,000 items of goods per second.
Its entire crew carried out almost 100 million transactions on "black Friday".
The representative of Dan Fogelman pointed out in the discussion for the left-wing Huffington Post website that the workplace left the entire "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was all "other media sensations" organized by the councils.
"Unsatisfied treasure!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where Walmart's business houses were not intended (they are not too close to the city, so they're almost here) but McDonald and other left restaurants.
McDonald says he's selling billions of pieces, and then he doesn't pay you for your clean work!
Jumane Williams, member of the City Council in New York
At the present time, the minimum amount for work in accordance with the federal law and the state provisions of New York would be $7.25 per hour.
The fast-food restaurants gradually increase this figure, but only mildly, and in average, they get their workers in New York $8.90 per hour.
No one's got a lower head in this expensive town.
I don't really understand how you can exist in New York for such money.
With a job at McDonald, almost a quarter of American teenagers who work at school after school for part-time attention and live with their parents.
Only a few people look after their main source of life or plan to stay there longer.
At the same time, I still meet with staff "McDonald", who complain that they have to live with these money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, on the other hand, the Wall Street Journal raises a comment that the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know how to feed them.
The protesters who started at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at "McDonalda" at 40th Street and Madison Avenue asked for volunteers and cooks to start getting at least $15 per hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wage.
They also called for the establishment of committee organisations in the area of rapid education.
American law prohibits the right to prevent the arrest of committee organisations and the claim of the committee's activists by fraud and neglect.
On the other hand, it only manages them as soon as life makes it easier.
However, the introduction of the rapid distribution of the committee organisation is also a complex one for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusual high rate of inflation among employees.
Nesouhlas
On that day, there were also protests in a number of other left restaurants in Manhattan.
The above-mentioned action was in the afternoon meeting at "McDonald" near Times Square, where a number of local democratic policies have emerged, especially a member of the City Council of Jumane Williams, who said, "McDonald" says he's selling billions of pieces, and then you don't pay for your clean work!
The demonstrators also looked forward to the support of other prominent New York Democrats, such as a candidate at the old town of Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must work together to support fast-food workers in order to achieve fair rewards for their work and economic prosperity, as each non-white person deserves!"
As New York Times reported, it was the biggest act of its kind in American fast-paced events.
But there were only a few hundred people involved in it, although not all of them were workers of the fast - food industry that employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event will happen quickly, which will bring the flame of the mass wave to light, is still unclear.
"At present, the brain is able to climb average"
Among the phenomena of modern virtual reality, virtual reality is a popular theme of expanded reality; in recent times it means to consider the world especially through the food of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer of its annual conference, Google presented the working model of this news and in November it was announced that the application for an appropriate patent was also submitted by Microsoft.
Speaking with the leading group of interactive 3D technologies in Cambridge's laboratory, Microsoft Sharam Isadim says that scientists in this company have already noticed the past.
The light is a perspective of manipulation with virtual objects in the air with large hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us the frame, what's your research team doing?
- We're dealing with human interactions with machines, but at the same time we're trying to cross the limits of this interaction.
The people have been involved in the phase of work with pixels on the flat screen, especially with their fingers.
We want to look at 5-10 years ago and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox console and cinematographic Kinect - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without Kinect cameras, because for all it is a very interesting possibility to manage with a gesture.
- What else is waiting for us in the future?
- Despite the fact that the Kinect system has transferred interactions to a physical level, a lot of interactions are still running on flat screens, sometimes in 3D.
The input stream has improved (the system accepts more data), but the output stream has not yet been particularly.
We're trying to change this, we're actually working on three-dimensional education systems based on different technologies, including design.
We need to put the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
To that end, however, it is necessary to know not only the users but also the space around it.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more appropriate way.
And in the first row - to hell with these stupid helmets virtual reality!
- What do you think of the voice control?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it worth it?
- Of course you can't consider it all - there's a private question, because we don't always want to inform others about our actions and objectives around us.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for example, we had a project to run in public places, where we thought of gestures, but not of soft ones, just such shorts.
The gesta would then not wear a camera, but with a frame that would monitor the movements of the bones and bones.
It's still big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the frame clocks.
However, it is generally paid that the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- And how is that?
- How do you ask me, for example, to give you this lemon juice?
Say it and show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, it'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to hire users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do at the moment?
- It's not necessary at all, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future, we will have to work first for the development of new types of filmmakers that will be able to find out more about the human reaction.
This can be, for example, laser cameras that provide a relatively good depth resolution, which is very important.
- Do you have to talk about your work with sensors Xbox Kinect, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough divorce today, deep enough, or something else?
- essentially the present generation - that's what we can reflect in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s speed.
But it's not just megapixels, it's like math and depth.
At the same time, all the current technologies are not enough for us - this gives the work of algorithm designers.
So we have to remember not only the resolution in terms of X and Y, but also Z.
So it's also very important to speed, the number of photos per second.
Human movement is relatively dynamic and current data flows of 30 images per second are fairly small, especially for the gesture.
Stephen Betishes, from our laboratory in Redmond, made an appropriate camera with a adjustable delay of processing in lengths 1 to 100 ms, while current, serially produced cameras are closer to second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone's understanding how it affects human interaction with the machine.
For me, work would be a very useful equivalent of such a device, I just don't need so much touch, but I need some pictures for a second.
- And there's no need to raise the number of cameras?
- In the Kinect system, three "cams" are now used, one of which is actually the infrared transmitter and the other - the receiver of the detected signal.
And already the third camera - it's actually a very common camera of visible sand.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem ...
Or worsen it because it would increase the required amount of the calculations made.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog system Kinect, play with the closing position of the camera and see how this can help when setting three-dimensional positions.
- If I remember well, Microsoft (in contrast to Google) did not present his glasses publicly.
Don't you think that when it comes to the daily use of technology extended reality through special glasses, it's one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking and still keeping the smartphone in the attached hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be the "transparent" kind of expansion of reality when it would be possible on the basis of the clouds platforms to switch from the flash to the smartphone, the projection display and the next to the dock.
Brilliant - it's a very personal device, it's their strength (the private things you see only) and the current weakness - the extended reality on the basis of the glasses does not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine the moment that manipulation with virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also to a regular killer.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no answer to this question!
My hand doesn't feel anything!
What answer does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that extended reality - it's seven after each other's going to break in mutual interaction between man and machine.
I think the supplementing of mass gains could easily become an eight-year-old.
To date, one of the interesting tricks is used - to use the other hand as a particular type of background for drawing.
It's an excellent way to record the beating!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding the magnitude of this "images in the air" - for example, the interference of several guidelines of ultrasound paper in the defined point where the finger is found, causes a massive feeling, but it's still very weak - as if you were looking at the edge of your fingers.
It is also available as a framework for restraint, which affects nerve endings in fingers - also a weak direction.
- You've tried to rob the brain?
To think he feels what it seems he should feel at the moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried it yet.
Here is another challenge that will be faced for a long time - how to embrace a person who is physically in a very tight space to believe that he is moving towards an open, practically endless space - we are also working on the concept of running trails (not even in clubs), moving platforms as well as huge shoes.
If brain failure becomes a goal, it's work for many years.
That's what makes work on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - a lot of things are in simple starters.
Experience instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "Peter Avantgarde", dedicated to the citizens who are in charge, are an avantgarde of culture and art.
At the top of the list, there have already been significant figures of Petrohrad's performance scene, whose spending exceeded the city's framework, often found recognition in Europe, without reaching all sorts of votes.
The new "Rosbalt" brain is a playful creator of Cyril Miller.
The whole city is known by Cyril Miller - a white man, who is dressed in red, where you meet here in the Russian Museum, here in the summer garden, here in fashion shoes and on vernishes.
Cyril Miller's poems, wherever they're displayed, always attract the gift of monsters.
Cyril Miller is one of the clean social and philosophical petrohrade developers, the creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller - this is an ideal husband of the Petrohrad avantgarde at the end of the 80s and early 1990s.
In addition to being a city man, his appearance on the streets makes smiles on the faces of the people, heightening all tension.
He recently took on a bottle and became a petrohradic flirter, as he grew up to this complex role in his entire divine life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why are you going all over the city in red and not in yellow or in Turkish, for example?
- I've chosen a red color as a designer with a look and an image.
In this world, the red color represents a compromise between artist, imagemaker and public.
It must be paid in general that everything that is just a little different from the rest of the world will be aggressive and exploiting bad qualities.
But my provocations are focused on the connection.
The whole history of my provocative actions is primarily a call for discussion.
And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition at the Cultural House in New York, where my work was performed.
I understand what's on my way.
At that time, I could not understand the freedom of the old unofficial artists and the new, free types of artists.
I had friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gazones who brought us to the "Pushkin 10" and there were no other waves.
It's nice to me for the theater, the dress, the music, all the genres, except for the words.
- And all of this happened in your art clinic... - It was important for me to be at the center of Petrburg culture, where all the best creative forces should be gathered.
In 1995, I had a place at Puškinské 10, and there was a music and art club, a bohemic club, a peterburg bohemy house.
There are many: NOM, Tequila Jazz, don't forget how Šnura brought along with the project "Ucho Van Gogh".
Snur and his friends sang under the cover of a light song, dressed themselves in appropriate tricks, among whom the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion, is among them.
When the hat began to play live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg has a lot of halli-galivian programs.
We gave them Trachtänberg, which started his great career, basic education, and professional training got from us.
Gallery "D 137", Gribojed's club - it's Art Clinic.
There are our employees and permanent guests.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture meant something else.
In 2000, a study was conducted in print, a special price was "People in our town".
I was named "The Artist of the Year," and that ended my top.
In the new times, according to the old rules, work is unacceptable, I am a man of truth, honesty, and culture of the past century.
In modern times it is easy to be popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are characteristicly recognized.
- Many of my pictures - these are the hits in which life is captured by reality and prognosis.
I'll have a program show at the Russian Museum in the classroom.
The clones are over-time categories.
I used to be social, being such today is painful and terrible.
But in the classrooms, everything is going to get worse, the tragedy is going to happen.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world from the path of total refurbishment in the sorting order.
Today, people meet by clothing, focusing on the outside mechanism, not on the inner person.
Or maybe he can't hand him a hand and he needs to swim in his face.
And the cow will be removed by a turn.
- We've seen you in the role of a city florist. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should have it if I didn't?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- At present, commercial, profitable art should be essential, tactical, sweet.
It's coming to a cultural collapse.
In the past, people were caught in lies, gods loved one another, just other people.
It's all broken down into microspyness today, it's very hard to like everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar banknote to like everyone.
Today you need to think about who you like.
Today, every culture garden has its 100 fans.
And there's a few thousand monsters coming to St. Michael's!
- He's got a boyfriend, he's having sex with the social sphere.
And there are 300 people on the cultural floor, and 10,000 are not coming, and as a result it's less management, money, all cold.
I have fantasy, the main thing is that no one's unbelievably and doesn't spoil what it's worth.
When I was a young man, I painted pictures of one collector hanging on a wall with Falk and Larion.
I started with the pictures that most people end up with.
Today, people are often confused about ideas.
They say:Culture is spiritual, culture is consumer.
There is no consumer culture, it's a waste.
I am a man of culture yesterday, I grew up in examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, denied money for drawing pictures.
And I'm for such a culture.
- Cyril, what's missing in Petrburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a concept: a factor in culture.
Not all of them, but they can be cultural.
It wasn't like that in the time of the fairs, the emperors may not have understood the cultures much, but they realized that real experts should be supported.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people who could be experts in Petrohrad, but they're somewhere in the kitchen because they need great experts who properly evaluate these experts and they'll introduce them on the right path.
It's expanding the experience today.
Even Erarta, but it's wrong that they honestly say that we don't accept all modern art, there are artists who should look for another museum.
- What do you think, Petrburg?
- Petrburg - it's not the main city of culture, in Moscow there's a lot more culture, there's the right soil.
And on our top, art is getting cold.
We need cultural land, but we have more writers today than readers, that's bad.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are strangers who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have such a kind of weakness.
We need art to become fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented by means of the St.Peterburg gift

The land is in danger.
Global heating or cooling with deadly asteroid.
The caravans of spaceships with land on the deck are on their way, looking for a restored planet.
To save mankind, the main question arises: How to keep your family in a more difficult situation or on a given recovery planet?
I don't think the choice is any big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be won, even if only hypothetical.
"It's Venus and Mars," says highly established scientist of the State Astronomy Institute P. K. Šternberga (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
But while there are better conditions for life on Mars, on the surface of Venus, temperatures reach 500 degrees Celsius.
Living there is only possible at great altitudes or at the orbit of Venus... in the universe.
To solve the questions of reproduction in the universe, scientists started with the flora.
Six centuries ago, tests on plants were carried out.
The four generations of the game produced on a regular drive are nothing better than their earthly neighbors.
Then there was the introduction of an orbital humour - very small fruit man Drosophyl.
In 1979, we were sent to the universe to check out how the embryo develops in a state of emergency.
At the exit we get absolutely normal bird.
But then they start problems.
"The problem is that this bird has to find support, has to stand on its own feet and start moving," says the leading laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Syčev.
If they don't find resistance, they're chhaticky birds fall down and make cots.
After 10 hours, the purely liquefied birds came to the purest range of instincts.
The birds didn't respond to light or sound.
And the problem was they just disappeared for four days.
"Two times we let the birds out, but then we rejected it because it's just impossible to work with them," comments the expert from the world's curators Vladimir Syčev.
The last "miniarcha" flew on a common road 16 years ago.
In January 2013, experiments will continue.
At the Bion Biosatellite, but they're only gonna have one sex.
He's been experimenting with the hostages who were being sent to the universe already pregnant.
They didn't reveal anything that was overprivileged.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - it's a unique experiment and such attempts need to be carried out," says Vladimir Syčev.
After landing on the ground, the human race was born.
However, it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of proliferation directly in the universe.
It's a heavy task.
Life-threatening people cannot simply realize their sexual instincts when they lose their normal environment.
Man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens is governed by abstract thinking and is capable of creating the corresponding emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying to the universe for 50 years.
The greatest danger has been the threat of Tarreškov.
The most precious thing mankind has is the female body.
Our tea went away, and no one on Earth could say if it's going to take a flight to the universe.
Is it possible to have a child after such a year?
"But no one has answered this question yet," says the veteran radio station Vachtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, more than a year after a year into the universe, the first woman-in-law of Valentina Téreškov's daughter was born.
The father of the child was also cosmonaut Andrian Nikolay.
In 1988, the son of the second woman-commoneur Lightlane Savické, who visited the orbit twice and who also worked in the open universe, was born.
But the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts that have been born and raised in the long years of human health.
"It can also be dangerous during orbital years," states the spaceout-pilot, the Soviet War Hrdin and the Russian Valerie Poljakov.
Nevertheless, mankind must look for new roads in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK hydrolaborator is responsible for the preparation phase for the flight.
Here, in the context of zero-inhibited cosmonauts, the skills needed for work in the open universe are overcome.
Water seems to be a lot more difficult.
The water for adults may be comfortable, but in its own way, the environment is a natural life for young children.
Small ichitinandria seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that the child is in the womb for 9 months and that it is easier to get to the water for them.
In principle, this is logical because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first purchase, it will take only 2 weeks.
"It's very little about forgetting something," says the novelty instructor Marina Aksenov.
It has been said - if the situation for the newborn child is more natural, then for women is more inevitable gravitational, forces are needed.
In the state of safety, it comes very quickly to the freezing of breast muscles, breast muscles, poor body’s ability to produce fruit.
We can leave this on the other side if the stimulators of the muscle function at birth.
Finally, it is possible for the birth to take place in a special room in which the mother's organism produces fruit.
"And what's next?" says Valerie Poljakov's complex questions.
On the other hand, the child also needs an art gravitational exercise.
If it is not possible to cause earthquakes on the body, it cannot properly form a bone or set of bones.
Newborns on a regular basis are not able to dress as adults in a special suit, which may be trained.
He'll just get rid of what he needs for his development.
"If we go with you to an experiment that will allow the birth of your child in a foreign environment, we will bring to Earth a healthy person who will simply not adapt to the present environment," recommends the lead committee for the bioethics IBMP RAN Igor Pestov.
So the distinction of children in the universe is only a theoretical question today.
However, the time will come when the earth will become a reality and the earth will be transformed into a distant planet that will become home to their offspring born in the universe.
Head of the NKU: Control of the blackout system has led to political interference
Česko has a good control and quality legislation in relation to public orders, but in its application.
In the talk for Current.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Authority of Miloslav Kala says.
"The law will never be perfect, but must be correct in its application - that's what we think is missing," comments Kala's current situation.
Similar conclusions also indicate joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example, incorrect practice introduces Petra Necess access to the so-called "protection system".
Mr. Prime Minister recently said that ODS would not be responsible for its controls - is therefore prohibited or permitted?
"The law must be quite well established, and if something is forbidden, even the President of the Government can't prevent the activities of the agency that has the duty to control and avoid responsibilities," Kala observes.
At the meeting of the Control Committee in Poland, you spoke briefly about the joint project between Czech and German parties, which was compared with the legislation on public procurement in both countries.
What exactly happened?
It's about the parallel control we started about two years ago.
It is simply said that the European legislation governs how public legislation is managed, followed by individual national legislation and then by the same practice.
We have all done this together, and even though the control is not yet over, we have shown very interesting differences - the general said legislation may also be "faster and more perfect", however, the practice itself is in some parameters better in Germany.
It is thus confirmed that it is not sufficient to continue to establish more precise rules, but it is necessary to comply with the law itself.
What can this project do for you?
Such direct joint control could contribute to our continued efforts to break the laws, reduce and overcome the limits if they do not have such a positive impact.
The economy means getting the right thing to do (which does not always mean the lowest) price in order to eliminate fraud and, where appropriate, criminal conduct.
But by reducing the limit of the ban, we don't have to do that.
Maybe this system will be filled with such a multitude of "paper" that those who want to find the doors in this system will be so much easier to swallow than if the limit remained higher.
You are talking about Turkey's problems with transposing legislation relating to public bans to practice.
How does the German control system work?
Is the office similar to our NKU here, or is it set up differently?
As regards the authorities, such as the NKU, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organised like us, also has a college, is made in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices are acting similarly.
The powers are also similar to certain measures, although Germany has a collective arrangement, so it has these accounting courts and at the level of individual collective countries - this system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only control public money, which we have provided by state resources.
The public resources that are directed at us by countries and objects are controlled there from the level of collective accounting courts.
What are the darker laws, so that's easier than ours?
I would generally not like to compare this without specific data, although in some cases Germany has been marked as a sample, but it certainly cannot be said that it is in all the better.
So it's also necessary to have better controls?
I'm sure not, but I'm saying again, I don't like this comparison.
But it must be said that even the countries we consider to be examples are facing a number of problems.
Otherwise it would be no profit to cooperate with our office for them, would it not?
What about foreign legislation, which has meant for your office the new law on public contracts, has already shown some of its consequences?
In view of the relatively short period of time for this novel, we are not yet in control.
Because we're doing ex post checks, we need to count with a certain delay.
We are now only aware of this in the process of preparing future controls - we have launched our new tool "responsibility risk detection", through which we have passed almost 14,000 public bans, and we have analysed them - these changes will be made in understanding, because the changes in limits, the conditions of some types of election management are adjusted and similar.
Do you consider accepting this law to be more beneficial, or are you in charge of the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise here is that it rules "exactly" and will not be possible to keep them.
In the case of regional operational programmes of the Regional Council, persons under control are already subject to the operation of the previous rules because any failure to comply with the public procurement law means a breach of the accounting fine.
So does the law value that way?
I don't think that way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, rather than betray those who will allow a formal mistake that has no impact on the decision.
Such a system will only create greater pressure on bureaucracy.
So how's it going out?
Let's show you where the road doesn't lead.
Mr. Prime Minister recently said ODS would not be responsible for the controls of this so-called "protection system" - and what does that mean?
Is the sugar system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be otherwise established, and if something is prohibited, even the President of the Government cannot prevent the activities of the authority responsible for controlling and disposing of duties.
He can say, "We'll change the law and allow it," but he can't say we'll do it like nothing.
In the law on public procurement, there are relatively strict rules on how to formally implement - which is proper for the protection of public competition.
But on the other hand, it's tragic when interests with the best offer are excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that's what we think is missing.
The roads are destinations, mostly but swirling
In a few places the Czech Republic is still on the road, and it is also snowed.
Most of them, however, are slow, some of the increased caution.
Karlovar Region
In Karlovarsk, the road was hot, but still soft and snowy this morning.
The temperature ranged between five and ten degrees below zero, but during the day, it has to be slowed down.
Snowing in the region has been established and only low levels are available.
However, on the Red Mountains, it is about 20 inches [30 cm] of snow.
The places were even less visible because of the tongue, resulting from data from the dispersion of the national motors.
The R6 speed lines and first-class communications are now unlimited in the region.
Caution is also on the site, for example, on some movements where the surface can be soft and cloudy.
The rails are also all the roads of the second and third classes, including mountain trains.
But in some branches, there are still remains of the remnants of the cold and the places of the cool snow.
First of all, in the higher areas, there is a need to pay increased attention to driving.
Pardubic and King's Country
On some roads in eastern Czechs, the sea is threatened, in higher places and on mountains can be reached by snow types, it will inform its pages of the Road and Distance Guidelines.
Railways are protected by drivers from the tide, which can be created especially in the higher parts of the Pardubic country.
The survey can be around Lanškrauna, Urstí nad Orlicia, Poličky, Svitiv or High Motto, especially on the road of the second and third classes.
Chemicals have been cured by engines I/43 and I/34 in Switzerland.
Snows are especially on the roads in the Krkonos and Orlic Mountains.
The affected snow species is in the highest areas on the railways in the Rychnov periods over the Knežnou and Trutnov.
In the eastern Czech Republic today, it is the most clearest until it is clear without conflict.
Temperatures usually move between minus three and plus one degree Celsie, flashing low wind.
Plenty of Plenary
The railways in the Plyzeńsk country are busy this morning, but there is a need for time to adapt to increased caution and driving.
It's cold after the morning, the temperatures move between three and nine degrees below the ice.
After the previous snow and the next drying, some communication may be more direct.
The seats must also be counted with the slow, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is due to information from the dispersion of the national motors.
Distance D5 is nearly unlimited, and increased caution is recommended by communication managers between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most of the first classes have dry and cold surfaces.
In southern Plzeńsk and Tachovsk, but there can be sharp cuts.
The communication of the second and third classes is flexible and, in this case, it also pays attention to targeted actions.
Drivers should be cautious mainly on less frequent roads in the area of the Samoan region.
Ololow Country
The snow is on the road today, and drivers have to be counted to the highest point of the Olomouk country.
She stayed on the Red Sea and on the way to the Videl Cross.
On the night of snowing, the railways to the terrain, according to the road managers, lifted a hole of three centimetres.
In other parts of the world, vehicles are most of the same without restrictions.
"On Schupersk lies in the highest levels of snow.
With snow falling on the Montenegrins, drivers must count in the direction of Jeseník," said today ČTK's driver of the driver's driver's driver's license.
By night on the ground, their colleagues had also crossed the Jesenick, and the roads to the highest places are now according to them after chemical treatment of coal and mud.
On Olomouk, the roads are unlimited, however, in Strasbourg, drivers should pay attention to the forest trails where the trains remain floating.
Eastern Republic, Liberia
Now a few difficult railways are reporting today, after the morning of the driver's ride to the north of Czech.
In addition to a few places with snow or snow, there is also a mountain road from Telnice to the Book of Osteck, which comes from the police database.
Temperatures are also maintained in lower levels below zero, so ice and snow are apparently maintained on the roads.In the lowlands, especially south of the Czech Central, however, there are no problems and the trains are dry.
The operating complications are not yet reported.
The lifts are reported mainly by the railways around the City.
According to meteorologists for it, there were ideal conditions at night - over the day of rain and silence, at night clear and dark.
The main conditions of entry into force are also reported on road I/13 at the border between Austria and Liberia.
The closing of the Telnica to the Book was made up of frozen leaves of trees that were exposed to the driver’s nose under the nose.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts we want to save positive energy
What do you think he's got to do with the end of the world in a few months?
It's just one of the other scary messages that people like to catch.
Together with The Tap Tap, we do more fun and say that we are the only capillary in the world that can gather enough positive energy to keep the world apart or prevent it.
In December, you will also arrange a single project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present him to readers?
It's a global benefit action we've been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the May calendar announced on 21 December at 11:10 a.m.
The day before December 20th, from 21 o'clock, the concerts are usually held in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They'll end up on the island of Kiribati in Tichomor, which is at the time 12 hours ahead of us, the Mayan calendar will end.
Who came up with this idea?
At first, it was probably my idea, and then we all thought together with our founder, Honzo August.
In addition to trying to reduce the supply of positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about the condition in which this world is once we deliver to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we have also created a unique collection of items of bots, triangles, bag or original keys against the end of the world with the purchase of www.e-tap.cz that people can also support us.
The Tap Tap Tap group, along with other interpretations, also sang a taxed hymme against the end of the world, which is called "the end of the world is destroyed".
He's already very popular on YouTube, is he also involved in these beneficial concerts?
Of course, and it's in complete conclusion, so if everything happens to us and the end of the world doesn't come...
All three concerts sing it together.
Hymnys are also being offered at the same time in a unique direct transmission to Czech television.
The words of this song were written and the main role of Jesus in the clip is played by Tomáš Hanák, also in Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also work with other characters of the Czech cultural scene, given that we organize a lot of profitable events and concerts...
We're trying to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested and interested in our cooperation.
What's the race from concerts to the end of the world?
For the preparation of the free education centre of Studio, which we have been working with the civil society Tap in the Jedlić building for six years.
Students of Jedličk's school are regularly attended by lecturers and are engaged in activities that are interesting and interesting.
Students alone don't have the means to get out of school on their own, so we're trying to make it possible for them to do this.
Within the framework of the delivery of the Jedlić Constitution, the future will create a self-construction building to which we will be transferred with this project.
At each concert, there are several musical groups and interpretations.
What did you choose?
We've tried to establish a program that describes all generations, including children.
For example in Prague, there are Chinese, Support Lesbians, Illustratra Sphere with Dan Barto, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchi.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning some kind of "bombistic action" for the future?
In May we will be the first to go to the Prague Park, so here we will certainly prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests.
In the next year, we would also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we're in the United States, I would like to do this with the appearance of Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans aren't minimalistic, you've been dating for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is however a group that creates people's handshake.
How do you manage these roads logistically and organizationally?
It's not as terrible as it seems to be at first sight.
We have five members on an electric car, their cars have to travel in the parking lot, and we're going to carry a lot of costs and a bag of tools...
However, this has always been done without problems, ČSA and British Airways have been well prepared for us, how many times I've been mad.
Even in Moscow, where we had recently returned, that was no problem.
Thanks to exits abroad, you can compare how each individual seems to be free of barriers, public access to handy and similar.
What have you ever met with?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than we do, we were just witnesses in Russia that in the east it is still in full beginners.
On the contrary, Moscow is a very barbaric, where it is still unusual for a person on an electric car to move himself into the city center.
It doesn't pay for any kind of self-evidentness, as the driver should give priority to the auction.
Unfortunately, there are also civil society that is trying to alert people to the problems of reaching out.
What, though, do we still need to reach a more rapid country?
There's a lot of things we're still behind...
But it is important to remember that perfection and improvement are always dependent on the efforts of the people involved.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common that people with a heavy handle move themselves to the public, can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
But it's not too common that a large number of people would be actively involved in social life there, but we are with The Tap Tap a little ahead!
Respect for the public or for impartiality is one thing, but even when important athletes, artists, priests, politicians or lawyers are among us, things start to change in real life.
It's still a single case of people who have strong wills.
Capule The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but let's go back a few years ago what you were supposed to put on it in 1998?
I came to be the upholder of the Jedi Constitution, where I had many young people around me who were interested in getting involved in something.
And since I'm a musician myself, playing in front of others on saxophones, I set up an interesting musical circle with my colleague.
Well, in time, as our Moderator Ládža Angelovic says, a little out of hand (Laughter).
But she's been popular for the last few years, or am I mistaken?
It's true that it helped us when we started preaching with famous songs and also actively working on the preaching of the capel.
We've come to believe that work that's not seen is basically like it doesn't exist.
Thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can also allow quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to add it to The Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential for something else to be done.
Showbusiness is filled with things where one looks like another.
It's in its logical way, everything new is taken carefully and it lasts a long time.
The things they're united are very small, but I'm trying to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of the man who first sees us is of course sorry, it's natural...
But this sadness is simply extreme because people with a handle are no suffering for all the abandoned habitats that we have to suffer.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, provided they have the means to do so.
I'm saying that if something happens to people with gloves, it's not just for them, it's for the whole company.
Has it also helped to make you a tough boss, as many people have noticed?
If we want to do quality work, we must be in a lot of uncompromising and demanding discipline.
But I think it's just normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic picture and a head in the clouds, and when they find out they have to go to the test twice a week, get ready and spend a lot of time on the way to the concerts, then the promotion will be slow.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something.
The Tap Tap tap currently has twenty members.
How many of them were at the beginning of 1998?
Only the only Lady Angelovic.
We're an open group, people are coming and coming, that can't be avoided.
Whoever has a will and a desire, always has a door open to us
It will be held before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 p.m.
Run in the Incheba arení, Brně Flédé and Ostravi Plynojem for the participation of 12 chapels and other musicians from the Czech Republic
At the end of the evening, all three cities are offering telemosts at the joint song The Tap Tap "The End of the World Destroyed"
The aim of the concert is to collect financial resources for the provision of a multi-functional non-barrier education centre at the Single Foundation in Prague of 25 million Kč
400 Kč, children up to 12 years of age have free access to Bohemiaticket
Polish and cosmos.
During the last week, Poland was adopted by the Ministers of the European Space Agency as a second member of this European Space Agency, as a second country from the country of the former Eastern Block (after Czech Republic, which became a full member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and has been involved in a number of agency projects over the next few years.
All the way Poland into space has started a lot earlier.
In the years before the second world war, the Greeks fought in outer space; but they did not always meet with understanding.
I recall, for example, the presentation of A. Šternfeld in the Warsaw Astronomy Observatory, which presented ideas from its work into spacecraft.
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the audience hungry, and after the summer of Sternfeld mentioned that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
Sternfeld was awarded entry to the spacecraft in France at the price of Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirscha.
The mentioned Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a major promoter of astronomy and cosmonauts.
In Polish journals, he published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books bound by these scientific disciplines.
Gadotski became the world's known promoter of cosmonauts and was assessed by the fact that one of the craters on the stolen side of the moon was named by his name.
In 1925, a railway line was set up in Poland, which was to be operated by a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is unknown and we do not know the details of the project.
It's not even clear whether the rocket should be used to break the wire or to screw it.
The information about this drawing is only known from time-print.
Since 1933, the Polish occupation has started with rockets.
Research has provided the Comorka Techniques of Armed Forces in cooperation with Professor Mieczyslaw Wolf and Prof. Gustave Mokzyckieg.
It is evident from the material studied that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
By the time the German army arrived, the investigation had been cancelled.
In 1937 a proposal was made by engineer Rohozinski in a professional print, which was proposed by the engineer Rohozinski, and the following year came the work of Rakieta - the wind turbine and the rocket bomb by the author of Lelyw-Krzywoblock.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects in the military use of rocket techniques were entrusted with the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Timed Scientific Committee) which coordinated all work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work, the war ended.
The work of the Polish Astronautic Society (Polish Astronautic Society) is also reflected in the work of the Polish Astronautic Society after the war in Poland.
The first is a summary of the company in the November 1954 issue of the magazine Problem, in which four more comprehensive articles are published.
One of them, by Prof. M. Subotowice, is designed to create a company that will remain a cosmonaut.
At that time, projects of art were being launched, and it was clear that space research was a perspective.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) has sought to enter the International Astronautic Federation (based on 1951) and has already become a proper member of the PTA.
And next year, the first president of PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became Vice-President of the International Astronautic Federation.
This function remained until his death in 1959.
Since 1956 PTA has contributed significantly to the development of very successful meteorological rockets RM (Meteorological rocket), which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and arrived at the first start on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with access of 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
A perfect version of RM-1A was later established and in 1959 a two-way RM-2 pilot test was launched in the Bledov desert.
The rocket was 1,4 meters long and its weight was about 11,5 kg.
Another type of development should already be capable of real scientific work - RM-34 rocket should have access to up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high wind.
However, further development was stopped in 1962.
The following first rocket type RM became the Meteor-1 rocket developed in the years 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a double, its overall length was 510 cm and its initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (defined Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) have been developed, which have decreased the size of the space for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket there was available a space of 0.4 litres, a Meteor-1B of 0.34 litres and a Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
Maximum access in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 he attended the development of the Meteor-2 rocket, which began his first flight tests in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying useful loads of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Next were the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions.
The entry of Poland to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the National Committee of COSPAR two years later is still to be mentioned.
Poland was also involved in the research of space space in Soviet art companies, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercomonate after Vladimir Remko.
Breaking the law on public works is not the solution.
In the past week, the Constitutional Court broke the law on public works.
The introduction has led to a lively discussion on public matters.
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in the globalised world are based on the principle of more, unregulated economic competition.
In effect, this means that individual economic barriers, national economic systems, are in a permanent conflict between them.
As a result, the principle of free trade and free, unlimited movement of private capital together with free financial speculation.
The impact of significant differences in labour prices is due to price pressure.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation when the manufacturer attempts to import the cheap goods into the economic competition by "supplysing" the price of the competitor with a view to attracting a greater share in the market and thereby increasing its own profits.
In the mass scale, this means that for most businesses, either transfer the product to another country, or buy it cheaply, or disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where job prices are higher than other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore the unemployment generated by it, the social costs of the state are rising necessarily.
The whole situation makes it easy for the owners to pay taxes and to compensate for the economic and social damages that have been incurred in the interest of profit.
The situation is so widely known that specific statistical data should not be provided.
Independent private capital practices are created in different economic situations when governments of individual countries are forced to enter into mutual competition with a view to reducing the social level of their own citizens with a view to attracting foreign capital.
In other words, governments give private capital but their own citizens without regard to social disadvantages.
This is particularly evident in the changes in the laws of law.
The aim is to encourage the economy of its own citizens to accept the price density of private capital, especially in the field of mining.
This is, however, a system of economic taxation in the case of long-term unemployment, but by limiting the rights of employees in the field of labour law.
As a result, poverty is growing together with growing differences between the poor and the rich.
In the SRN there have been a number of years of public income for poor people who cannot enjoy their own work.
The number of these people already goes to millions.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for people to get decent jobs so that they have to be paid to an existing minimum.
Such a scandal has also been published in the case of auxiliary social workers.
Effective measures of practically all the southern EU states are undoubtedly leading to the same situation when people under the pressure of a catastrophic social collapse are forced either to migrate as it was in the 19th century or to live for food for the rest of society in hopes that a private investment capital will come to the country at least once.
Where is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because China, India, Brazil, either Turkey, Morocco, or Egypt, or Africa are still working to break the European flag.
It's all about Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media argue that the state cannot participate capitally in its own economy, that the managed economy leads to economic disaster.
The private capital of Sweden is based on the view that the state must not be able to apply the guiding principles to the economy.
It should then be asked whether private capital does not affect, it is now in fact guiding policy and this whole state in its own egoistic sense.
Here's a unique answer already.
The evidence is practically powerful and in all the states it's universal lobbying.
As a result, the situation in the area of corruption, the provision of mutual benefits, the law, where virtually all are criminal but not criminal.
In the SRN, the situation is such that the state ministries for lack of financial resources are responsible for developing legislative proposals by private legal firms which are proud of the industry.
These legislative proposals were then adopted in Bundestag.
All of this does not come from people as the constitutions of the West type vote, but from the financially strong groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberally oriented democracy is now rapidly getting to the situation, as Appianos describes in his part of the crisis of the Roman Republic during the days of Caessar and Pompeia: "The state has been in full interpretation for a long time and the authorities have been involved in violence.
For payments, illegal acquisition of goods and by means of stones or swords.
The payoffs and corruption broke out without any arrests and people went to the elections with the previous vote" ..."the characterized people didn't know about the office, so one day it was eight months without consular consent." "The effect was that the only drug in the bad situation was self-government and that it was necessary to choose an energy man."
The conclusion, as in the past, is based on the independent preferences of own resources regardless of the overall interest of the public.
The private capital is no longer capable of understanding and applying the overall benefit of its foundations.
The result is now, as at the time, an unprecedented decade without any effort to reform the deeper race.
We must therefore look for a causality of fascist and communist regimes in the independent liberalisation of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
At the same time, the savings of these systems in favour of the liberal type of democracy can be considered to be a certain halt with the expectation of another car.
Especially disastrous is the fact that modern elites are totally ignoring possible statistical losses in lives, humanitarian and social disasters that we are now witnesses of crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new events.
Breaking the law on public works is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of economic competition at both international and internal European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
So this trend is system-wide.
The solution is the objective of policy-social reforms that strengthen the state's share of capital in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: Chaos laboratory.
"Nothing goes away from violence and can never go through" Sting in the song Fragile whose main verse in the refréne is "not forgetting how we're short."
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be anyone" dying Gutter Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild's wife in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, many reactions arose.
One stands for Israel, argues about his right to self-defence, and the Palestinians join the role of terrorists, others support Palestine, argues the racist state of Israel, the genocide of the Palestinian Arab nations, and the state of Israel stands for the role of the State of terrorism.
I do not want to think about who are in the periodicals of the violent killings of the guilty and who are the victims, and at the end of today's Israeli citizens, including their own territories, have been born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
It is about offering readers a view of the opposition, a view of who has been in service for 95 years (counted from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on the small coast of the Middle East country.
Some of my views are supported by the historical facts available, some of which are derived from my own understanding of who the resp. whose group of people is the main cause of modern history.
People's actions are the first of a series of acts of violence.
We can check on Alexandra the Great or Napoleon at any time.
What is not so obvious is whether it was always those qualities that simply guided their steps and whether or not they were someone who guided their actions to the desired goal.
We must admit that we are living in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that the money and the power that flowed from them cannot come to the lives of a single generation.
Among these astronomical rich families is one that could be considered to be the head of the Chobots (if anyone still stands above them, but I don't exclude it) - Rothschield.
It's not much about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) has bought in the 1990s to stop linking their name with high criminal effects, which have remained behind and which have always meant the consolidation of power, wealth, or both.
They have major shares in almost all the central banks of the world and against countries where the central banks have no driving or preparing wars (7 countries before the attack by Afghanistan, 5 countries after the invasion of Iraq, only four after the defeat of Kaddáfi, but between Russia the central bank of the Russian government was subjugated).
Whoever tried to burn this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Central Bank of Rothschield's Bank of America, began in the civil war to issue his own (intellectual) money and was murdered in 1865 in the castle.
The JFK began to issue its own money and wanted to cancel the FED, was murdered in 1963, and Ambassador Louis McFadden was dismissed in 1936, and he wanted to appeal to the FED for a major economic crisis in 1929.
Their zeal for global power led in the years 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of the plan of the three world wars with the highest threshold, 33rd degree dedication of Albert Piek.
The first war was to remove large monarchic state cells in Europe, the second had to remove colonialism, especially the United Kingdom, and the third had to reduce the world's population somewhere from 0.5 billion to 1 billion people (such a number of children for their comfort and luxury are enough and do not need so much resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a prelude to such a solution) and the final transfer of absolute power.
The method that the group of the richest families in front of Rothschieldy is to call for a crisis and the next offer of a solution (order ab chao - order of chaos).
However, these solutions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the FED Foundation so that the crisis does not repeat itself as it did in 1907).
So after they were killed by Habsburg's successor, R-U, the throne of Ferdinand, in Sarajevo, to blow up the first world war, they destroyed the Russians by bringing the Bolshevik revolution to an end.
The first world war ended with an unreputed, military and economical capitalist Germany (no longer needed for the war to destroy Russia) and subsequently came to the distribution of the European Central Power, Rakouska Uherska.
In order to facilitate the discussion of the second world war, the politicians allowed the latter to create a conflict situation by putting huge war repairs in Germany, which they had created, for example, the radicalization of the supplying masses and then were able to support only the Germans with sufficient strength, wines and simple solutions offered by the Leader and further the creation of the internationality of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority that was to be collected and also the fifth column, with the blessing of the war fire.
By the end of the 19th century, Rothschield’s foundation of the Zionist Church, one of which was based on the creation of a Jewish state, was promoted in the area of historical Judah with Jerusalem as the capital city (turning back to Zion).
The already mentioned Balfour declaration created a forecast for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, beginning to arrive at the first stage with the local Arab population.
The terrorist attacks came on both sides.
The second world war broke out if Hitler broke out of the network on which the international bankers had held him, or all he had done was hard to imagine, however, that the suffering of the European Jews in concentration camps had created a premise for acceptance by the Jewish state of the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like the German war-rehabilitations, was committed to World War II, a third war fire was launched by the State's declaration.
If international bankers are able to disband it, the Jewish nation will, like the second, sacrifice in the first line of wars, now, together with the Arab or the general Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of lightning and chaos not only within the country but also at international level (we will only take care of people on the reception and rehearsal of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim of the Palestinian - the Israeli conflict, where the evil will produce evil in the endless chain of violence, when the greed of individuals and their greed for global power are at the beginning of everything?
Here, it is necessary to separate the people of Israel from their leaders because, like us, international bankers support people's elections in their own elections.
The current Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is a typical example of a fascist, international loyal, policy that does everything to resolve the war with Iran, which, in view of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), has threatened the transition to a global conflict and the control of Iran over the Hormushian sex, which is traveling 20% of all world-roof-roof-roups (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide) and the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with the new world order."
The new world order in their performance is the world of gentlemen and children.
A world where the rest of the human population serve as a comfort to the hearts of financial aristocracy.
A world where every new birth unit is implanted at the birth of a chip that makes it a fully controlled habitat.
"And urge all the small and great, rich and poor, free and children to have right hands or feet, so that he can not buy or sell who is not marked by the name of the Shelm or the number of its name.
That's what you need to understand: who has the mind to cut the numbers of the helmets.
That number represents a person and that's the number six hundred and sixty-six."
Argo: When it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, he collected donations from Islamic students of the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
The missing were to be replaced by the wounded uncle Mohamed Réz Páhlaví, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, who was the boss of his regime for several decades.
For the U.S. administration, she did not offer a positive exit - going through the deck could not afford to be allowed because it would seriously undermine trust in associations in other countries.
The surrender of hands, however, in Iran, where the revolution was brought about in the establishment of the theocratic regime, was not possible.
It was the morning for the United States' prestige, which later intensified the harmful attempt to free the arm of force.
The diplomats were finally released after 444 days after the merger between the Algerian government.
Their assignment at home called for a wave of solidarity and anti-civil feelings.
Debakl, in Iran, has expressly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film directed by the director Ben Afflecka Argo describes one episode of the history that America has brought about a small victory.
Just before the ambassador was arrested, there were six employees.
After complex perpetrations, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian archipelago.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to obtain them from Iran, assisting the extravagance of the history of Canadian passports as members of the film's state, which looked at the location for the launch of the ski-fi film in the country.
Combination of seeds
A plan that was designed by an expert on "exfiltration" by Tony Mendez, also called for Hollywood's cooperation.
To make the legend reliable, the film project was written in specialized stores, the press conference was organized, and the firm had a real office.
The details of the operations were long-distance, the film comes from Tony Mendez's memory.
Affleck's film is a special combination of more genres.
On the one hand, a real-looking political thriller, also called "caper movie", the story of a piece of paper, a picture - can be a series of Danny's partners.
In the film, the events - on the one hand, documented sequences from Tehran (in the title sequence are shown iconic contemporary photographs of events and how the same situations were presented in the film - there are no big differences).
On the other hand, a remote passage from Hollywood, combined with irony and peaceful overcrowding.
And then still scenes from the CIA center and other institutions - men in the clothing are picking up situations in the same tables, on the streets of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck had an excellent way to start a career.
From the laughing priest, he became a respected director and his legacy ceased to be the target of ironic fame.
Argo is his third birthday film, after the dark crime of Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the city's thriller (2001).
At the same time, it's the first Affleck's picture that doesn't play in the director's house in Boston.
The atmosphere of the place, however, was one of the characteristics of the director's older films raised above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck's showing it in Argu, where Teheran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film are played in streets, when reconstruction of real events - the initial sequence of the collapse of embassies is due in its perspective, which at the same time involves the emotion of shame and incompatibility that arise when the events are at some point clearly moving.
Similar effects of Affleck and its employees are achieved in the scene of thinking (a false statement on the Tehran base).
You've done a lot of things in too many places.
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story is not really a big deal in the sense of filming scenes.
He's working quite successfully with this little thing, sometimes he's actually thinking about something - it's not going so elegantly out there (the scene in which the terrorist crisis in the Tehran airport opens the phone in America and the corner is driving a lot of hair hits).
But Arga's weakness is the dispersion resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in the role of Hollywood staff, but their positions would serve more space and are not the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film is so much losing dramatic silence, it's a picture that can be followed with a peaceful interest, evaluate the realization and retro style of the exciting thriller in the '70s.
But it's just hard.
As a reminder of a certain way of living history and evidence of how the representations of all powerful and conscious secret services have been transmitted, but are becoming.
Rules for smoking balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which issues an annual questionnaire on the most suspicious banking fee, has now decided to issue a competition on "Unreasonable Regulation or EU-wide ideas".
"It has led us to this last event when the EU plans to adopt a 40% quota for women in the management of large European companies," the legal editor of the Patrik Nacher survey said.
Among the so-called absurdities, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice on the harmonisation of the rate of insurance for men and women has already been made.
So far, women have been exposed to the prices of life insurance because they are less vulnerable to insurance.
"More incredible ideas from the EU can be identified by the end of the year.
Then the vote itself will take place until the end of February 2013,” Nacher reported.
The EU's controversial regulation also requires that biodegradable compounds should be added to the soil content, which, as a result of environmental damage, further prohibiting the use of dependent pollutant temperatures only because they contain relatively small quantities of dangerous substances, or the directive on the size of light bulbs, as a result of which the plant has been explicitly exposed this year.
In the past, criticism also led to an actual ban on the use of the term of confectionery butter or the classification of classical wines from sale.
Qualified bananas have 14 centimetres
The Union apparatus often decides on the pressure of either the trade or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels are usually met by a state or a group of states (that is why Czechs now and with the threat of the wind carry out the requirements of their banks).
The interests of the lobby also remained because, for example, the bananas had to reach the highest quality in the Union at least 14 cm long and should not show "anonymous coverage".
The European Commission has also protected itself by harmonizing only the existing inconsistencies of national standards that have complicated trade.
Standards on fruit and vegetables already existed in the EU through the opposition of some states, showing that existing directives lead to food pollution.
The candidate for victory in the survey may also have a lower EU regulation, which states that it must be borne in mind that children under 8 years of age should not smoke without the attention of adults.
The EU here called for an American research, which says the balloons between toys are leading to the death of children for breathing.
Similar restrictions now apply to children up to 14 years of age when breast-feeding.
Curiosity is born at home
However, it is quite absurd that the rules concerning European officials themselves - whoever has an official function in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia in the name of Greece and must instead talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
In cooperation with the association of the liberal economies of Laissez Fairi, the Bank’s banknote.com server appointed in the questionnaires other than some of the abovementioned absurdities and the Union regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of the Member State.
The EU has established maximum levels of food supplies that could be found on the territory of the PRC on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the limits set in the preserved languages, which threatened its high concentration.
The investigators also made the idea of paying a certain country for their lack of sea and the idea of making an application for a grant.
However, these ideas did not occur in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are disabled by having no sea.
We ask the European Union for refunding," said the former Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that we had a lot of greens and that, as a result of such intervention purchases, he had to be full of funds that he had to make.
In order to continue its accession to the Czech Republic, the EU, according to the Palace, had to pay hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission launched the CR against the organisation of a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries which do not have access to the sea.
The grant grant was offered by the local Ministry for Local Development, managed by the German Minister Paul (US-DEU), and in particular they had to apply for the grant from Brussels.
EU: Foreign regulations are exceptional
In the Member States, it is easy to become the target of criticism, EU efforts to regulate and at the same time improve the functioning and development of the Union as a whole, according to a number of experts.
The most serious problem is that experts say that the EU's approach to projects which have no sign of any European integration, but which have been rejected by Member States during the accounting years.
The feeling between Czechs is also encouraging that, like other Union countries, the CR in Brussels must fight for the right to specific labelling of its traditional products, which does not always succeed in this scheme.
The Czechs, after six years of war with the Germans and the Rakushanas, threatened the marking of the ools of the wild beasts, but the Tusan Rome, whose tradition in us until the 19th century, had to convert our producers to the desert.
The designation of rum can only bring products from trite distillate and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of EU-registered products, there have already been carlovar sugars, carrots and kerosene syrups and zetacan molluscs in the world's known cheese companies, marcipan from Germany or from the porcine cane.
The EU's protective label can also be used to swirl the pardubic pennies and hot tubs.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm an amateur, Okamura says.
Mr. Senator, how does a man attack that he wants to apply to the president?
I don't care whether I'm a senator or president.
If it works in our country without any problems, I'm not candidate.
But I can't see how in the last twenty years the country's thefts, the more the thieves run, the more people get paid and the age of retirement.
I shouldn't have been a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, I'm trying to figure out how to change it.
And since I was forty years old and I'm independent, I have no choice but to apply for a senator or president.
You got to the Senate, but you're interested in the City.
Aren't you against the people who chose you?
I've been saying I'm going to war on the City as a result of the senate elections.
Later, I made sure that if I was elected senator, I would apply to the president.
My goal, but it's not a function, it's a tool I can perform my vision.
That's why I need the greatest influence and the strongest mandate.
The problem is not only that we as a nation are spending time in the house and on television, but that we are going to get everyone who wants to try to change.
In addition, the media are used to spread lies about freedom of speech.
I may have been told that I'm paying the press or that I was the counsellor of Jiří Paroubka.
Let's go see you.
In the war on the City, you have expressed the heavy and criminal responsibility of politics and back ownership over twenty million.
That's what you need to change the law.
As President, but you do not have such authority and only the Senate can propose laws as a whole.
How do you want to figure this out?
When I, as a citizen, fought to make the leadership a free life, it was possible to do so.
The problem is politics - if someone comes with a good proposal to the left or right, it's called an objection, and the citizen keeps it.
As an independent neutral, I have much greater potential to receive support from all sides of Parliament.
My priority is that without page scanning and teaching I can take something that's best for our country, from every side and apply it.
Do you think you're more than just a man, or a left-handed man?
From a Czech perspective, I think people are going to sleep on my left.
It doesn't matter to me whether it's a little left or a little transport.
It's important for me to go ahead.
I don't care if anyone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to connect people.
I always support any good public solution, even if it is proposed by KSCHM or ODS, and I will also resist wrong thinking.
You'll be surprised if someone says you're popular.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan in the company, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
And you're trying to get closer to that.
Someone may call it populism, but all the suggestions I'm talking about are already working in the world or talking about them by significant experts.
But without Parliament's support, you'll be left with only passwords.
And you won't be long enough in politics.
Or do you think that when you go out with people and talk to them, you will be able, for example, to face up to punishment and heavy responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them to our side so that we can get through this.
If I have been elected as President, it is not a problem to arrange a direct television transmission, where I ask the President of Parliament to lay down a heavy and criminal responsibility for policies, officials, judges and state representatives.
And they should somehow tell her why they don't want her.
If there is a strong personality that will name the shortcomings, it can be pressed on a political scene.
Take the President's vote directly, it was the public pressure hearing.
At the same time, I say I'm an amateur that I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinion and vision, I'm trying to look for connections.
I started politics first, and I'm trying to get a lot of support for my programme.
I'm trying to do things myself, but it won't work, I'll end up in six years, and I'll be back in the private sector.
It sounds a little like Okamura should save Czechs.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not doing anything in one person, so I've been running a number of famous people, whether they're not candidates for the Senate.
I went with Radi Jançuro, who refused because of a lot of work.
So at least I supported the detective journalist Jan Lorenc, who covered the gaps with light fuel oil.
I've been praying that people are really upset, but now I'm pregnant.
Sixty percent of the people went to the polls, and those who went were mostly elected representatives of the institution.
We're only two independent in the Senate.
People called the Senate so that changes would be difficult.
Still, I'm going to fight for my vision, for example for the direct election of the elderly or the Haitians.
Do you consider setting your own side?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the pure history of every potential customer, and I don't even have money for it.
I don't have any money on the presidential campaign, there's only 20,000 in my transparent account.
You don't have money?
You're talking about property recognition, what's yours?
The private property I estimate is about 60 million.
In Prague, I have a gross area of 25 million, ten million, another eight million, a collection of works of art about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million, and the Superb for a million, and then I have a couple of millions on account.
By the way, I've got Aston Martin because it was my boyfriend's dream - I've always liked James Bond, who was driving in the car, was gallant to women, and at the same time fought against evil and inhumans.
You drive Aston Martin, you own 60 million and you don't have any money on the campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to give your own money.
It's not too convincing.
I don't have 15 million on the campaign.
Is that what I owe you?
I've already killed 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors proves that my program is probably not that interesting.
And I have no obligation to pay for the campaign.
The costs of the campaign will basically cover what I'm going to get the senator's salary.
But I wouldn't take it from him, for example, I couldn't pay the son of an English school worth 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I don't have a candidate.
So you're still a business so you can live?
Didn't you say you're going to miss these activities?
But it doesn't match the higher salary.
As I promised, my activities were partly wasted.
For example, a passenger will become my representative on the train.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who will save the Republic.
But I need to get out of something, too.
How long have you been as a businessman been used to taking a month?
Two hundred and 400 thousand, which I'm going to take.
And if I were president, I'd end my business.
The entire discussion will be held in the Sunday edition of the Law.
The MVRDV architects are proof that real adventures are not only played in the head - for example Spijkenisse and recently established Hora books - 2 photos
"This building seems to me happy, it seems futuristic. It's finally a sight of something interesting," says Lisette Verhaig, who goes around the corner of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby big business, says, "Well, the house is nice."
But I wonder what we still need the library today.
Everyone has Internet, iPady and electronic books.
None of these old-style books are available today, are they?
Spijkenisse, sitting in close proximity to Rotterdam without his own job opportunities, which are not even worth a visit, keeps a special record.
This village, with 80,000 inhabitants, is the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to solve this stupid situation, a few years ago the decision to contribute to general education and to establish seven beautiful gems painted by the miniature of fixed bridges that are displayed on Eurobanks.
The success of the educator of offenses, but he was never back.
And so the townsmen knew that there is only one way to get statistics: we have to have a library!
Viny Maas from the Rotterdam Architectural workshop MVRDV, a master of brilliant columns and a producer of funny, often even cynic buildings, accepted the thing with normal ease and in the course of the 2003 competition, he appeared with five books under guard and framed face.
And while the Commission was still looking forward to it and baptizing branches, Maas raised his gifts to himself according to the size, and his active-informed words ended with the words "Dear City Towns!"
So this is my proposal to Horu book in Spijkenisse, so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, 30 million euros were completed.
It is part of the revitalisation project, which also belongs to the underground parking lot, the supermarket, the mail and a number of adjacent residential and railway homes with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, Hora was designated second location "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
A small town now that could not offer more than a post-modern step zone and an unusually complex workshop for which you would expect milk for the white façade, is more rich than a little modern architecture.
But above all, he now has Spijkenisse's first public cultural building in the history of his existence.
Long way to the nest
First thought: the reading hall under the cover of the cheese.
By means of the mass of the mountains, the wind is running out of air, but the actual space and readership will be very clear until you reach the topography.
On all sides the mirror interior is bright and transparent, the floor of the burning cabin and elegant street lights clearly express the public space atmosphere.
The city environment is perfect.
You see park villas, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And all the books, books, books.
"Normally there are rules with books around the façade and in the middle is a large dark space, which is most insensitive and personal," says Winy Maas.
We've set up a classic space configuration and we've pulled out the reader space outside.
Inside Hory books are widely used: offices, Internet libraries, chess club, ecological centre and central home technology are located in the center.
In particular, black police are on books that are once walled, one parapet, and the other cover-up.
The look, the structure, and the smells make a difference.
They even attract architects and construction engineers to the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, leading project at the city town of Spijkenisse, on a standard magazine question.
And that's how we found a suitable waste product from agriculture one day in a Frisian agricultural company.
For many years it has been used as a base under a millimetre root from synthetic weight in the scaffoldings and fields of the Netherlands.
It's light and timely.
The dry textile will last one, two seasons and then mature to lead to massive waste.
For the library there was roon - the first in such a quantity - placed on the sheets of a thickness of four centimetres.
With special iron and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) is colored in dark, homogenous and loaded material, which smells a little as a new car and a little as a sport bottle.
You'll get on top of 105 stairs.
At the end of almost 500 meters long journey, you will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city but also with Dutch croquets and flowers.
They care about the atmosphere, but mainly about the correct humidity of the air in higher literature.
New Souls' Gifts
"If you don't believe it, but this house is despite many glassed flats with an environmental project," says Trouborst.
He's getting out and colding the earth's heat.
Although the mountains stand under a clouded cloud, the light of the sun is only short within, and it is also in the sun's day.
Widely beautiful wooden trailers, which stand at the edge of the exploding phase, serve as a stopover and capture much of the sun’s burning.
The air in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of it's completely automatic.
Stefan Spermon, the original IT sceptic from the industry, has already visited the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who even marks Boekenberg as "a long-term expected soul" Spijkenisse.
Reason: Every citizen of the city was invited to open a book from his personal fund a few weeks ago.
This should be the first to be filled with optical fairs not yet fully equipped with a library, which currently numbers 70,000 pieces.
The concept was confirmed.
The police are completely filled.
"There's nothing worse than an empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every citizen now has a certain relationship with the new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just on the floor.
The MVRDV was in the royal discipline, which is called the creation of identity in a professional gargon.
Spykenisse's letter of literature.
She's young and uneducated.
That's the end of the eastern point for identity.
The theme: "The Germans Must Play Biggest Role"
Germany held a vote on the decision to adopt Palestine.
According to the expert on relations between the United States and Europe Stephen Szaboa, Berlin is thus balanced with a solid diet of diplomats.
Deutsche Welle: Germany at the beginning of the week first signaled that it would vote against the proposal on the observer status of the Palestinians in the Organization of the United Nations.
Then Berlin held the vote.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
Now Germany must be honest because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he's even supporting the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - even though it would be too critical to Israel.
During the rebellion in Libya in March 2011, Germany also held a vote in connection with the establishment of the wireless zone.
This is the end of NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stand on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The reason is that it just changes its foreign policy, which is the policy that was so directed by the US, to the German foreign policy.
The situation is more difficult for Europeans not to have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans are between two fronts.
They're expected to play independent roles, but they're not used to it.
I think they're moving in their role first, but they're on their way to "normal" foreign policy.
The foreign policy they have in France or in Great Britain.
In particular, what is the "normal" foreign policy from the German perspective?
It shows readiness to take action in the case of national interests and the existence of which are independent of existing US or European partners.
I think that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, export and its relations with certain areas, whether Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are somewhat different from the economic interests of others, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Were economic interests affected by the situation in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has a large settlement in the Middle East, especially in the states around the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, it must be careful not to intimidate the public, but not even the elites in the Arab countries.
It plays a role anyway.
I don't want to sign it, but it's not a completely unilateral relationship.
However, it plays a significant role in German opinions at all times.
Has it damaged Germany's relationship with the United States when Germany held a vote in favour of both important decisions, for example when voting on Palestine?
I think that in Europe and even in the United States there will be a great deal of understanding for the German position.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic as Libya's question.
Even Germany has a certain degree of respect.
It also indicates that it must be considered as an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
There are various views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The U.S. has clearly spoken against the veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always been due to American internal policies.
I think Obama's government probably has considerable understanding of the European position.
But because of the darker political situation, this position cannot, of course, stop public.
I think that differences in views are not really as big as they always seem.
When you look at the relationship between Obama and the Ministerial President Netanyahu, Obama is not much more than Netanyahu's policy.
Is it not difficult for Germany to conform to its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and with the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's exactly what's bothering the Germans.
For Germany, of course, it would be a little easier if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not currently happening.
So they can't be part of a wider line and have to take things from their own position instead.
They're just doing it with the euro.
I believe that Germany will play a leading role in the future and will force Europe to a European existence.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of the relationship with Israel.
It was always a sensitive subject.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play an independent role.
See Germany itself in the role of an important international player?
Or is the leading role for Germany still difficult?
Germany's still not normal, it's still not acceptable, and for some reason it's still difficult to play a larger role for this country.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, as often as Germany plays a major role, there will be resistance.
That's not easy for the Germans.
This is actually an old problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be friendly for the most diverse neighbors and opinions and it's not easy.
The US's influence on European politics is still waning, but the EU is not currently completing this vacuum.
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, they don't like it, and he'll make it even more unpleasant - c'est la vie!
Stephen Szabo is the deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, the institute where academics and policy experts from Europe and North America jointly study the challenges of the transatlantic community.
He is also a member of German Marshall Fund, where he specializes in German politics, foreign policy in the United States and transatlantic relations.
"Protect protection" in China: when Puma and Armani are united Chinese
Armani is a well-known symbol, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
What's Armani Polo?
It is therefore hidden from the mark which has been officially registered in China but has nothing to do with the original company.
It does, however, enjoy protection for as long as real owners do not regret it.
And it's not even clear whether the law is right.
"For a foreigner, it is still harder to protect his marks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office, who specializes in the violation of security rights in the Far East.
Every week I'll get a new case on my dog table.
The participants already have a few more letters to be able to sign their signs.
From Gucci marks, for example, Lu-Gucci becomes and instead of Prada are allowed to register Prada-Kny.
In this way, also German companies are legally copied, the manufacturer of the Puma sport product should be.
Pattloch will open the records of the Peking's sign office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company was allowed to protect the trade mark Zegna DF Puma. A professional name that also stands for the fashion house Hermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that China's masters are the world's masters in copying and misinformed spiritual property.
In large cities, there are several shopping houses, with almost excellent shops.
Pattloch's cases are different. By entrusting its mandate to the Chinese companies to obtain from the sign office the official right to use the label that has already been protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpi", an associated sign.
This word is referring to "Bang Dakuan."
There's so many women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It damages the trade, we have to destroy it," says Pattloch.
"The sign is broken, the excellent position disappears, the damage to the image is huge."
Financial losses and court costs incurred by the companies are to millions, especially in expensive product displays.
According to CLSA market research company data, China is the third largest market in luxury products and the fastest growing market in China.
However, the removal of missing records in the register can be difficult and something is worth it.
The procedure may take up to nine years, with an uncertain result.
Pattloch will report cases when the court refused the complaint because the name mentioned has been after a long period of "market reality".
When he has a grieving party, he has to pay the plaintiff yet because he has damaged his sign in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes it's the law of the jungle.
The known cases are also related to the graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler won a legal dispute with the manufacturer of Sany's construction machinery, a company that recently took over the German ceramic producer at the Putzmeister concrete mix.
Chinese therefore today may use a symbol similar to Mercedes's star.
Geely, who bought Volvo, originally used a blue logo that was remembered by BMW. Spor was urvy, Geely had to change the logo.
The manufacturer of the fashion product Lacoste lost in China with the Hong Kong and Singapore dealers, who were known as Crocodile in the wrong direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO network will agree that there was a lack of sufficient number of employees and space in 2010.
But in the last year, it was reported that "the process of working has returned from the emergency situation to normal".
For example, the number of unprocessed procurement procedures was 22 per cent.
There were 57 000 of these cases closed, 75 per cent more than in the previous year.
Still, 81,500 more facilities are still waiting on the office.
There's something wrong with this business. It's expensive.
As it is often in China, it's an impressive number.
In last year CTMO received more than 1.4 million requests for protection of the mark, which is almost a third more than 2010.
It's a record and means that China's set up behind it leads to a list of new reports worldwide.
It also pays for the number of all available security signs - it's up to 5.5 million.
In 2011, it was selected for payments of 1.8 billion June.
Simply this means that each notification averages 1280 Jews or 160 euros.
A number of ways to start this fight are to start with, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
This group has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarists for more than seven years.
The Germans have come to the conclusion that his illegal production of imitation car parts has been abolished.
However, the shareholders guaranteed Chinese rights to the Freudenberg mark and continue.
We would like to remind ourselves of this because in Germany there can be no designations protected, says Hanno Wentzler, president of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO also rejected the invention of the minority company.
In the other two institutions, Freudenberg ruled the law, but the resistance to the conflict is still fighting today.
He needs to be careful.
Now the case is settled in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that it will lead to a good end and commend the professionality of the courts.
But she also says, "The driving is extremely expensive and is worth a lot of time, money, and nerves."
The internal costs cannot be calculated. In the archive, companies even had to look at hundreds of years of old records to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg, on the contrary, was offering a "high sixth share in the euro" for the purpose of resolving the dispute.
"You see what that means for us," says Wentzler.
He's afraid that the danger from the Far East will affect Europe too.
And it's in case there's unguarded signs.
For example, one Chinese producer wanted to sign the Freudenberg label for clothes and skin in Germany.
This area of business was long abandoned by the group, although it was able to withdraw the registration.
"It's important to pay attention," says Wentzler.
He and Pattloch counsel advise German companies to be very careful when dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international law. The foreigners should rather "all the way they stand for protection, report to China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
The effect: if Freudenberg's company in the final activity of its drama is subject to the sign, then it will probably have to pay the licence fee in its own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we'll be in the dispute segment forced out of the market.
World Day Fights Against AIDS: Smoking, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, the Imongani Congregation is being tested - and in Sweden, orphans are happy to be among the parents who have died of AIDS.
A connection experience that exceeds much more than 8733 kilometers.
First of all, it's a dump: battleships, basketball boots, ladies' boaters and panties are looking for a ticket park and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then they slowly take the voices of songs - al, bass, tenor and soprano - urge, mom and each other.
The 29th-year director Fiete Hopfa is almost twice the size of his textile boots when he connects his voices with his particularly wild gestures.
It's Monday evening. In the music scene of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imongani congregation is trying a new song.
There have been dozens of songs and songs between the ages of 23 and 69, from human genetic research to home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy stock, each congregation voice has another text and more in a very foreign language - a zul that speaks to tens of millions of people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Sweden.
Help to Self - Help
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Organization programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
Of that 23.5 million lives in South Africa.
In Sweden, there are 245,000 orphans who have died of AIDS by their parents.
HIV is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans after their parents died in AIDS, in the village of Esitiani, he found a group of Voices for Africa patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend the second grade school.
In 15 or 20 hours a month, you can take over the pattern.
It guarantees a school, school uniform and one hot food every day in the Gogo Centre.
Impongi means "reformer of stories" or also "one who grows up".
No one can speak in this space, just sing.
For almost ten years now, the congregation has been singing songs in this foreign tongue, and sometimes it is bringing it back to where they originally come from: to Africa.
In the air distance 8,733 kilometres from Heidelberg, it is still located in the northeastern part of the Kingdom of Estonia, which is dependent on the possibility of the voice of the German congregation.
Forty percent has been infected
There are 2000 people living there, some even in empty or broken lakes, most of them children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they've been infected with HIV.
In Estonia it is seen in the small, which is the capital of Sweden: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.
The design of a male front covering, which has been shown to reduce the risk of a half-life ban, is unacceptable to the public.
More than 40 percent of people in Sweden are carrying the virus of weakened immunity in themselves. There is no reason to die in the next three decades.
This village revealed the congregation on a joint trip to Africa in the summer of 2005. However, in the first place, members of Impongi saw many children on the streets, where not only parental care was lacking, but clean everything: food, clothing, education.
Without finished school education, they have no chance in the poor country at all.
At first, it was a private meeting of individuals who were able to send a child to school for a couple of euros a year and give him one hot meal a day.
A year later, however, the Voices for Africa congregation was established, which has been taking care of orphans after parents who died in AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
Who are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial SPI is a syphilis, chlamydia and a gonorea.
The common sources of PPIs are HIV, human papillomavir, herpes Genital or hepatitis.
The mussels and swab belong to the parasitarian SPI.
Who belongs to the group of the most successful?
Syphilis and puppies are primarily available in men who have sex with men.
Roberta Kocha states that at least four of the five cases of syphilides reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, they are sexually transmitted diseases that are common, chlamydic infections, trichomonade, candidosis (skin), pupica and human papillomavir.
HIV is relatively small among the heterosexual adults among us, but the total of 20 per cent of new HIV infected people belongs to this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydic infections are more common than in other groups of citizens.
According to European studies, three quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years of age.
In addition, among young people, human papillamavir is often used.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
According to Robert Kocha, the number of syphilids reported has increased from 1697 disease in 2001 to 3698 disease in 2011.
The number of new HIV infected persons has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, there were some 2700 cases.
It's about a decade less than a year ago.
What symptoms are warning of a serious illness?
Infective disorders may cause joint damage in the area of genitalia, muscle problems, rash, subcutaneous pain and diarrhoea or bradycardia.
Often, however, no disease or other symptoms are caused and therefore remain unwarranted.
How can you protect yourself?
Hazardous restrictions may reduce condoms, however, do not offer 100% protection.
Because sexually transmitted diseases can be partially transmitted and infection from unclean and difficult physical contact.
The experts therefore recommend regular examinations, especially in the case of frequent sexual partners.
In the case of chronic diagnosis, it is possible to cure most of the SPI and prevent future consequences.
Thanks to the patronage, generous gifts, and in the latest series of honorings the congregation, some money is collected throughout Germany.
"We've already sent a total of 200 000 euros to Estonia," said the president of Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany is being spent in the very village of Zodwa Dlamin, a woman of course who can move.
It's also about finding afflicted children, for example, some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as it is called old women in Zulju language, is the village of the village.
Some of them even took 14 orphans, gave them shelter on their heads, and took care of their children’s delivery every day in school uniforms.
Children who no longer have any children go to Khanishle, a single woman who pays together as well as two cooks who cooks for more than 200 hungry children a day.
"Voices for Africa" also founded a school of milk, set up two cooks, and together with the American health organization PSI arranged that many people in the village would stop testing HIV.
It's not obvious, even though the disease is so obvious in the whole country, everyone is silent about it.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because she has something to do with sex."
In fact, it's quite strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 husbands.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his mindless lifestyle.
Let's take the place of democracy.
The approved way of life in this country is also responsible for the rapid spread of HIV virus in the last decade.
But there are also many migrant workers who spread the virus across the country.
Annette Lennartz says the condoms are on every corner free of charge, "but no one uses them.
Culture is different - unguarded sex."
To support the cultural exchange at least a little, the Imongani congregation travels once in two, three years together in South Africa and sings a song full of charms, wars, faiths in the future and the knowledge of the blacks that many in the southern tip of the black continent still know from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing in black words - such appreciation brings not only joy and joy, but also has already resulted in tears in many wild foreign soldiers.
The road always leads to Estonia, where singers visit children over whom they have a patronage.
Even though you find this village difficult to find on maps, the river Ezulo is more than you know.
"Go to Estonia, there is light," people say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is 8733 kilometers from here to the dulciful songs in the experiment at Bergheimer Straße, you see that light shines here too.
Messenger: NASA published in Mercuri led
Sonda Messener found evidence that it's on the planet Mercur ice.
The ice cover could have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The National Aviation and Space Agency (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet of Mercur.
Although the nearest Sun is located, there is also cold water, as it derives from three studies published on Thursday by the professional journal Science.
The Sonda Messener found evidence that there is a ice cover in this area of the planet, which lies in a permanent state.
This is evidently a minimum of 30 cm and possibly up to 20 meters strong.
This water came from everything from coke or perhaps from asteroids that were found in Merkur.
But let's not give you a lead to the existence of life on this planet, said the leading scientists working on the Messinger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercuri can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, research could help us to explain how water and other basic elements of life have been obtained into other solar systems in other areas.
Sondy, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix, undetected landscapes, participate in the exploration of the deep universe.
From time to time, the pictures go to Earth, a small corner into endless columns.
The picture comes from a photograph device developed by German scientists from Maxe Planck Institute.
Eight planet our solar system, plus the planet Ceres's endurance.
Just as Pluto, which surrounds the Sun next to Neptune, is not Ceres according to the new concept definition of the International Astronomy Union of 2006 "planeto".
This expression from the infrared image of Spitzer's telescope shows "family portrait" of countless stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, highly identifiable are red-coloured "nonorozeneta" on the birth pool of stars.
This area where stars - scientists call it unromantics W5 - revealed Spitzer's telescope in the Cassiopeia constellation in the distance of 6500 light years.
This mediocre star dying of stars captured Spitzer's NASA telescope.
The inner ring consists of a material that the star has died during the dying process.

One of the largest and most accurate pictures of Hubble's telescope: viral galaxy
Photographs of spiral galaxies are made by actual artificial parts, according to their color.
The exhibition, published by the European Southern Observer, depicts a few thousand light years of a distant trifide in the Star Star.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "tripidus" (distributed to three parts, triangular), because dark pieces of dust make the heart of this star family to three parts.
In the distance of 400 million light years from the Earth, the astronomers photographed two moving galaxies in the distance and have to come to the coli.
This birth of the star marked Hubble's telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who doesn't like technical cuts can call it a South Wind.
The photograph from Hubble's space telescope shows the image of Iris' tongue in the Cefea constellation.
This 1400 light years is made up of workpieces, which are ten times less than the usual domestic dust.
This picture was composed of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It displays a ring from the black walls, which is 430 million light years away from Earth.
This galaxy group, called Arp 273, marked Hubble's space telescope for NASA.
These larger spiral galaxies are called UGC 1810 scientists.
In this star valley is the most recent group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The star's collage is still leading to new developments.
This star cloud, also associated with the voice of Rosette, is still born to the young stars. They are 5000 light years away from Earth.
There's still no dust in this clear blue galaxy with a little black hole yet, just rain.
Scientists believe that it was just a short time after the Great Cross, when it was a major guide throughout the universe.
Our Views of the Universe: Most Important Telescopes
The remote view was apparently found in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey. He used her to observe the star a year later before Galileo.
From that time onwards, the perspectives of optical distances have increased - and the views that are being emphasized are still deeper.
The world's largest telescope was 30 years old, and it was from 1947 to 1975, Hale's telescope at the observer Palomar near San Diego.
The view on this picture was about five meters.
There's a Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona, U.S.A.
It enables you to observe the universe with two views immediately, each of which has an average of 8.4 meters.
The Gran Telescopio Canarias interior on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. It is only 10.4 meters wide.
The South African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to reduce costs.
Still, its average reaches a depth of eleven meters.
The absence of a light design method: the telescope is secured by a high-speed cable that limits its mobility.
In the high-ranking field, Hobby-Eberly telescope is also set up in Texas.
Its features are a great boost to the light stream.
Despite the relatively small scale of the view, it is equal to the world's largest telescopes.
Radio telescopes in Arecibu (Portorico) provide scientists in the universe with extraterrestrial signals.
This radiotelescope has an average of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - search for foreign intelligence - it can help any computer owner who makes available his accounting performance.
View of the observer of the European Southern Observer (ESO) in the Chilean Andeans.
They're standing here with Very Large Telescope - and they honor their name.
This remote view with a full four-eyed view can also shine a medium-infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large distance is also planned for the Chilean observer of the ESO.
His main mirror has 42 meters full and it has to be made up of about 1,000 pieces of mirror.
However, the pictures can be counted first in 2018.
Two Keck's remote views of the Hawaiin Mauna Kea were considered to be the world's largest until 2007.
They're offering two glasses, each with an average of 10 meters.
Keck's telescopes are part of Mauna Kea's observers, who, in addition to them, observe the universe and the telescope Subaru and the IRTTF.
The Mauna Kea also has to create a new range of telescopes - with an average of 30 meters.
Here you can admire her on the picture.
However, we will find the most significant discovery of the universe through Hubble's space telescope.
We have been provided with distant worlds since April 24, 1990.
The space telescope Kepler has been working since March 2009 on extrasolated planets - especially those that are civilized.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets had been identified since the start of the mission.
The picture contains the last preparations before the launch of the space telescope Kepler.
The space remote view of James Webba (JWST) will be launched first in 2018 into the space on the Airane rocket deck5.
The primary view of the space-infrared telescope has an average of 6.5 metres.
One of the telescope's tasks is to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Great Cross.
Scientists come from ice on the south side of Merkur.
However, there is no reliable data, as the Messinger circles around this planet far closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have shown for several decades that it's on Mercuri ice.
Thanks to the Messinger trial, which was sent in 2004 and is the first one to go around Merkur, scientists are now secure.
Drink butter every day and you'll live 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people live in Bible times.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Looking for a step in the country where people are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people live in Bible times.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Looking for a step in the country where people are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
I'm going to get back to Talish. We can call the romantic savages.
Microbus calculates by means of a series of many attacks in the form of heavily loaded shells, wooden rivers, and simple circuits.
It's all green and smooth, as soon as it seems we're in Schwarwald.
However, this is the largest of them in Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few miles away.
Here, there is a Caucasian ethnic group of the Talysians, which is not very well known, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani and live a very high age.
The last station is Lerik.
This town is too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which is not happening in the small hill country of Jaksi.
Tourists from Europe don't travel here. Coming from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too easy.
It takes eight hours to 323 kilometers because the train is just one way.
The riches of the land for which the oil is grateful in the Kaspic Sea have not yet reached me on the outside.
However, Pilate Fatulaj (48) is convinced that Lerik is about to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku celebrated Eurovise's High Price in May - and we will have the festival of the oldest people in the world next year," Fatulajev says.
He's the director of the long-term museum, probably the only one in the world.
Here's a documented life of almost eight Tuts of Talyšos from around the world, who are older than the years. Fatuljav shows a black photo.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he was still raising a child.
However, this museum is the shepherd of the shepherd of Şirali Muslim, apparently 168 years old.
The birth certificate does not exist yet.
And since the oldest man of evidence was 122 years old, Islam's age seems to be very mistaken.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulaj.
This man was evidently married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he still had a daughter.
So he didn't lie to Shirali Muslim at his age for a few decades?
However, he also heard about the people in Central Asia Rembrandt Scholz, the circleologist of the Maxe Planck Foundation in Rostock.
"There are many people of high ages who live in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Scholz says, "and there are very many very old men living in Sardinia."
However, there is no scientific evidence of age, especially when mothers are missing.
Every day the mixture of dissolved butter
In fact, people in the area around Lerik often experience the age of Bible truth.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
So why does he live here in the south for so many years?
Azerbaijani leader Farid Mugimzadeh explains this to the special genes of the Talish.
The director of the Fatuljev Museum, however, believes that he is counting on it.
However, the fact that just the caloric grass of the Talysians who love meat, bread and especially milk products and many of which drink the ingredients of the dried butter daily is so healthy, it does not seem reasonable from a bromatological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that sustains young people? In Chegemiran, a small settlement near the town of Lerik, where Rubaba Mirzaev lives.
At 97 years of age, she is still relatively young in this landscape.
The Mirzajev, who claims to have 143 seeds, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasian region.
He's sitting on the ground with a knife that he doesn't know about.
Under one roof, there are eight people here, except one of the sons of Mirzay and the daughter, both of whom have been ancestors for a long time.
There are two small children in the neighborhood.
In the kitchen, a tea is prepared for guests, which is given in typical dried "armad".
The white teeth of Mirzay make a perfect order and hide under the hat a long dark blond copy that the mountain reveals to us her son.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they didn't look like me and kept the color.
"I've never used champagne," says Mirzaev.
The monthly income for life is sufficient
She always ate only what came from her own court, lunches, broccoli, games.
For the rest of my life, I didn't even buy food in the supermarket.
Then he'll tell me about his husband who was in the army.
The worst was the second world war.
But everything improved when the universe took over the "loved father" Geedar Aliev.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
However, the cult, which surrounds the positions of the fathers of the nations that ruled his country as dictator, in Azerbaijan, does not know the border.
He was in power by 2003, then took over his son Ilham's wedding.
Old people in Azerbaijan don't have to suffer at least.
Mirzaeva receives a monthly pension of 230 ments (about the same amount in the euro). This is to a greater extent the amount from which it can be used well.
And maybe he's a long-standing son of Mirzay: "Old people live in our culture of great importance."
They live among large families, they are loved, cared for, and happy.
If that's not the reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of "human rights" in the constitution is missing
The revolution came back to Cairo.
Undisclosed demonstrations in Cairo revealed a profound dispersion of the country.
The sharp debate is about a future constitution based on the right of the charm.
The Egyptian president didn't save the path.
We need to create a transition.
"And because this happens to us, I'm responsible, before people and before God," he said on state television.
His words were directed to the entire nation, especially to the Christian Coptics, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and secular persons.
All of you, I'm sure you've been wondering about the suspects, but they're scared.
Fear before "God's State" on the Nile, issued in mercy to the mighty Muslim brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursey almost apologized that he had overstepped the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court and expanded his own so as to "save the revolution."
However, a 61-year-old engineer who has the title of a doctor at the U.S. University in southern California really wants to save, and there is no Egyptian or the world.
Should the court be free of power?
Paragraphs 234, which immediately approved the constitutional meeting of Islamists in the fifteenth-century night marathon, in part raise concerns.
As in the previous constitutions, it is also stated in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does "laws" mean?
That was and is an explanation and you can be afraid that Islamists are using this unclear formula and associated legal space for a more precise explanation of the charm.
At least this explains the new added paragraph: In all matters relating to warfare, it is necessary to consult with the University of Al-Azhar, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with a major impact on the entire Sunni Islam.
This is not necessary, but it can mean that the clergy will carry out a review of the law, which would actually bring justice to justice.
Many things are explained in the proposal of the Constitution
The problem is also that civil law of military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts served as Mubarak's government to provoke opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, there were up to 11,000 civilians in the military.
As proposed, the state should also protect "the right foundation of the Egyptian family and support its moral and values".
This is so clearly expressed on the legal page that by means of this paragraph, the State institutions may even control the content of film art and literature.
Understandably, this means nothing more than a censorship.
Finally, no paragraph in writing limits the explicit equality of men and women.
Therefore, another paragraph prohibits the prophet Mohammed and his proclamation.
However, the unknown remains what Hanobing is and how it will be achieved.
Similarly, there is no doubt about the wording that "man-made" is prohibited.
Is there already a president's cartoon or a joke on the account of rights experts?
More explanation as to how much else in this proposal, which Mursi submits to the signature, and according to its words, it will "be very soon" present to the Egyptians for the purpose of human vote.
"The revolution has come back."
For several weeks now, opposition has been formed against Islamist rule.
Tens of people gathered in extraordinary solidarity on Friday evening at Tahrír’s place in Cairo and were willing to destroy the constitutional document before it began to pay.
"The revolution has come back and we are welcome," said Hamdin Sabbáí, who placed himself in presidential elections in third place.
The Nobel Prize winner and former Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed Baradaj declared that the proposal of the Constitution was "in the ancient ruins".
Through the short news service, Twitter accused Mursey's allies of wanting to carry out "a fight against democracy".
"If he declares a referendum, we'll go to his palace and kiss him," said opposition officer Jasir Said.
"We're not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not been disturbed yet," said Egypt's media of opposition policy Chálid Alí.
Several judges announced that they did not want to look at a referendum that would be free of charge.
"The Qur'an is our constitution"
The well-organised Muslim brotherhood declared the atmosphere demonstration, however, never at Tahrir’s place, but after a joint prayer on the other side of the Nile before the Kahar University.
She was attended by many pregnant women and salaphians who called out: "People demand the application of God's law."
They said: "Purity to the earth!" and they said: "The Qur'an is our established place."
The battle of superiority over the symbolic city of Tahrir, in which everything started, was likely to trigger a similar civil war.
It's Mursey's allies who obviously didn't want to risk it.
The Muslim brotherhood declared that the opposition and the rest of the proposal had been put to the vote and clearly expressed.
Now it's time to let people in optional hours decide which direction the country should go.
Most are certainly considered to be in favour of the Islamic proposal.
"The word 'human rights' doesn't get out of hand"
The constitutional dispute that should, in fact, continue until the end of the century and integrates all the social forces, says Hafiz Abu Sa'du.
The eight-year human rights defender and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) denied the members of the Muslim Brethren when they were in or before the court of Mubarak.
Not because he would share their ideology, but because human rights are inseparable to him.
That's why he was murdered, sentenced and imprisoned.
"And in the new constitution there are no 'human rights' words at all," she complains in the conversation for "Welt am Sontag".
The forced expansion of power on all three power components in the state has brought this lawyer to a halt.
These measures are a scandal against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"In order to strengthen the civil society, the president actually broke it," Sa'da complains.
However, without civil society organisations, democracy cannot function.
Sa'da feels abandoned by the international community, which is following the game of ideological fractions on the Nile with mixed knowledge and enthusiasm.
It could be him.
The demonstration at Tahrir's place warns: "You've created a monster that you can't control anymore."
Norwegian fishing: The world's most exciting fish?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the country's secret of success be linked to local appetite for highly pollinating fish?
Take a couple of overcrowded cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a collection of spinal and soft football equipment.
Let's lay it down for a week.
So you'll get those paralleling raffles, one of the biggest Norwegian delicates.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, three hours from Osla.
There's snow, beautiful view - and in the air there's plenty of air.
Rakfisk is a salted pstrum crushed in water for up to one year - depends on how much you want fish to swim.
As it sounds and starts to be cold, Norway here in Fagernes begins attending a festival dedicated to what it says is the best, most delicious food.
"Drink this acid and then drink it with a glass of water," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional teacher, but also called "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for the festival.
People around us eat little pieces of fish and sing them a lot of alcohol.
"Some people prefer to aquavit rather than a rapist," Havard says.
A drink can take over.
I'll try a few pieces.
If fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's like a sushi shirt that was on a long road by bus.
Rakfisk is a very different product when it was poor in Norway, and because there were still no refrigerators, fish were found in the underground airstrips with water and salt.
Then, in the middle of the winter, when they were well-encouraged, they pulled out and ate, and there was certainly no alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and look for jobs, mostly emigrating to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% create immigrants to attract a large number of jobs, high incomes and a wide range of care systems.
The citizens of Sweden, the old river, which was still much richer than Norway recently, is moving to the country for work.
It is considered to be an important, unsatisfiable feature, even though a relatively touching part of the Norwegian past.
It's between the most expensive food in the market.
Even though it's all sweet, little beer or sandwiches will get you nine pounds (14 dollars) for lunch.
Norway is often unable to obtain worldwide reports - and it seems that most citizens do.
The name of Anders Breivika, a legal racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children in the past year, is still missing.
Instead, the shooting is called the 22nd July event.
Norse can only find it hard to believe that in their dying country, one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
With the current wealth of Norway, one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries has grown since the early 1970 ’ s.
"But Rapa is not the only reason why we are doing so well," she says, when giving Tallers with a credit rating of our Anna, who is with her long blonde hair and surprisely blue eyes represent the prototype of Nordic beauty.
We're what you're saying, people take care of.
Its English, just like most of the people in the world, is just innocent.
We don't give up, we don't like showing up.
Norway is very careful with its cheap wealth - except for a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When all the others in the years leading up to the global financial crisis distributed money that they did not have, the Norse had a strong grip on their tables.
"As long as we can lie in the winter and go on vacation, we're happy," says Anna.
"And eat raccoon," adds with an old smile.
I'm standing in the snow at the front for something to eat. I've got enough rhabs already.
Such a lot of burger is definitely something else and it's beautiful.
But tonight's an exciting fish back here.
The hotel in which I live is one of the many places where coffee is served for dinner and where guests love the best or best for whose most annual fish.
They have this connection to live television transmission, where the modulator is a model surrounded by a raffic taller.
It's like a Eurovision song competition.
"What shoes do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergen?"
"There's our gardening here, Havard."
It's called a bandit and a smile.
From the seat, a man will fall, possibly capable of aquavit.
Or maybe all the fish's consequences.
Enrique Pena Neto from Mexico has a hard start
As Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take over the office, Will Grant from BBC looks forward to the challenges facing him and to the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transport in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In the city, which has been captured even in these best times, steel barriers have been blocked by several key routes into the main city and due to road chaos.
The aim, however, was not to prevent those coming to work, but to prevent protestors from accessing Parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the president's Sherpa and will take over the leadership of the people.
They're going to make a big deal.
Mexico has led a good economy at the time of the resignation of Felipe Calderona, but the country has been in the hands of drug wars, which have already taken 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said President Pena Nieto of the United States President Barack Obama in Oval, who worked at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before he signed his hand with the American president, President Pena Nieta gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
The views of the new leader are also different in his old home, the population and the vast state of the capital.
He's a real man.
For example, in the foreign town of Valle del Bravo they remember him well.
His citizens contribute to the development of tourism in aviation and infrastructure.
Now you can get to the city after one of the new distances that Pena Nieto left to build. These distances are a huge improvement in the transport of wood and rough roads that were here before.
The discs with its name also relate to the walls of the modern sports center and the impressive interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
"We expect it to bring about a real and lasting change," said friend and political associate Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, State Ambassador of President Pena Nieta, Party of the institutionalized revolution (PRI).
In particular, we look forward to the interesting and real changes in the area of security and the economy that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years of uninterrupted power, the PRI party was driven by Vicente Foxe.
Ambassador Olvera acknowledges that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, Enrique Pena Nita is expecting a lot.
And he rejects the statement of opposition that characterizes the new president as a person without a substantial content.
He's a very busy person, very busy with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a great politician, and he's mainly a man who can listen.
But on the other hand, this is not an idea that has a lot of people from its former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, there can be no contrast with the narrow streets of Valle del Bravo more obvious.
The city of the capital city of Mexico is famous for its remote location.
And the problems in the self-righteous village are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the army was authorized to assist in the control of drug gangs operating in the fourth, especially armed women.
Only in the last two years have the bodies of these murdered women been buried in the deserts along the vast ramparts of the waste.
During his reign, Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in Mexico, much more than in the city of Ciudad Juarez - a place that is a synonym for the murder of innocent women.
In a better case of criticism, Pena Nieta says that when she moved to the office, she sat in the hospital at the time of an adequate killing with the problem of the murder of women.
And in the worst case of his conduct, he is accused of blinding his eyes.
In the concrete house, typical for the fourth quarter, Irene Buendia shows me pictures of her beautiful daughter, Mariany Luny, and fills her with tears.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that he killed her partner.
"When I got into her house, it seemed like someone's dead," recalls Mrs. Bundia.
There were signs on him after his injuries, and death had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which is the only word "Justice".
However, this is what the family says, exactly what they were told.
The state authorities were treating me like I was an old pig, a bear and a rabbit.
They want you to just accept what they say and hide.
"But it can't be right when it comes to making mistakes and forgetting," she says.
The Sherpa, which will be held by President Pena Nieto on Saturday, is entrusted with great responsibility.
In the last six years, dozens of families in Mexico have been subjected to violent crime, and the new president promised that after his move to the office, his priority would be his.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was a governor," says Ambassador PRI Olver in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what families are most afraid of in Ciudad Neza.
Bradley Manning didn't insist on misconduct, military prosecutor.
The military prosecutor is trying to reverse Bradley Manning's claim regarding the cruel behaviour in the fight.
The hearing focuses on Manning's staying in a military league in Quantico City, Virginia.
The defendant wants the case to be dismissed on the basis of gross behaviour with Manning in prison.
The military is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that military soldier Bradley Manning, who is accused of the greatest exception to secret material in the history of the United States, has missed many opportunities to resort to cruel behaviour that he has apparently endured in the military service.
The military prosecutor of May. Ashden Fein, at the cross-examination hearing of the army of Manning, at a hearing in Ft. Maede in Maryland, claimed that the records of weekly visits that Manning had with the officers of the units during nine months of detention in Quantico in Virginia show no difficulty in misconduct.
The cross-examinations made during the hearing of the motion for an appeal to refuse the case brought against Manning because of the cruel conduct in the time of the arrest, which was self-sufficient, lasted the day after Manning testified that he had considered suicide in the contest.
An analysis of military intelligence arrested in June 2010 has been accused of stealing thousands of secret documents during their duty in Iraq.
Material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
During the five-year hearing, military prosecutor Fein, together with Manning, passed a form filled with officials after meeting with Manning in a prison in Quantico, where he was held in the regime with increased fear from June 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him on Friday at this form, Manning admitted that the behaviour of his guards was considered "exact" and the total behaviour in the device was considered "very professional".
The forms do not show any trouble with misconduct, even though the officers of Manning directly asked about how he was treated, Fein said.
Manning replied that the concerns relating to the various problems were expressed orally and that the officials who visited him spoke to him about these concerns and pointed out that they would be killed, however, did not mention them.
"They signed "no problems" (after which they discussed concerns), and this did not necessarily mean that I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Denise Lind also asked Manninga why he did not complain to his person in January 2011 when meeting with the Commission regarding suicide thoughts which he had expressed in the form several months earlier.
Manning replied that during this meeting, his intention was to achieve a reduction in the "prevention of injury" regime.
The army indicated that it used this restrictive regime (one step under the control of suicide) for its protection and security of others.
"I wanted the audience to know that I was all right and that I wanted to break this treatment regime... so that I could enjoy the increased quality of life as I saw it here," said Manning.
On Thursday, Manning witnessed his arrest in Iraq and transport to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before he was transferred to a prison on the basis of seafaring in Quantico in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he was watching suicide in Kuwait, and once he woke up there because of the heat.
He pointed out that he was not allowed to know what was going to happen to him and what was going on in the world.
"My world died only on the base of Arifgian, on this hill," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Manning indicated that after arriving in Quantia he spent most of the day (minimumly 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in small ones without any company.
Manning said he had only one matrice, cover, nicknames, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to walk because he was sleeping or just lying in bed during the day against the rules.
Manning said he always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He pointed out that if the guards could not see his face when he turned around the other side of the night, they would wake him up and have to come back.
Manning's legal representative gave a formal complaint against the manning military in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned the charges raised in the fourth complaint concerning the fact that after being sent to sleep one night in his entire village in Quantico, he was also forced to stand face-to-face before the guards and other colleagues in early accounting.
Manning said he wasn't allowed to hide his cover when he was counting.
At the fifth hearing, Judge Manning announced that by order of his guards, he had found a cover which could be hidden, but admitted that no one had given him a warrant for his resignation.
On Thursday, Manning said he had been forced to sleep the night before because he tried to prove to the officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning indicated that the officer said he could use the dog from his underpants or his summons to hurt himself, but he didn't do it.
Manning told me that this night he was removed from his cell by his undercrowds, his nicknames, and his glasses.
His legal representative hopes that the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and that in the case of his testimony before the military court, which is expected to begin in the beginning of the next year, his sentence will be significantly reduced.
The defendant stated that he planned that Manning would be guilty of lower criminal offences and that he would fight other charges because they are too extreme.
The beginning of the hearing is scheduled for this week, it is expected that the military prosecutor will fulfil the necessary conditions as justified.
The Pentagon stated that Manning was held in accordance with the provisions relating to all arrested persons in relation to the maximum security.
The charges against Manning include assistance from enemies, unlawful means of publication of reporting documents on the Internet, the transfer of information relating to national security and the theft of public property or records.
If he is charged in all points, he can be sentenced to life.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says that many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the insufficient opportunities they are there.
The Mexicans have a tendency to blame those who left; they remind them of difficult times, she says.
Navartte says Mexicans are lions between the two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital city of Mexico, I barely got to the roof and I got to the immigrant agency room where I found the problem.
The chips pointed to one of two fronts: one for "Mexico" ("Mexico") and the other for "Extrajeros" ("Cisinci").
I stayed there for a few seconds, and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in central California, and my whole life was called "Mexico."
It's an ethnic short, just like my friends in Boston call themselves "Iry" and my friends in New York identify themselves as "Italy".
So I ended up marking the Mexican American later.
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need to use shorts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to manage both sides of the conversation in this language.
However, I don't have the vocabulary of the native language and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and set up for the "Extraneros" front.
I was thinking about the time this week the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House of President Obama.
The programme had normal concerns when the leaders of these two countries met: immigration, drugs and trade.
Penna Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why it is the same probability that Mexicans will stay in Mexico as they travel to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trade block similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue in the Mexican war against drug cartels, even though he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complex and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States attacked Mexico and led its leader under the threat of arms to over half the territory of Mexico in the United States.
But for Mexicans who think around the clock, not minutes, the memories are universal.
So a minute after the representative of the United States says a little bit of criticism about Mexico, you'll hear in Mexican press and among the elite problems about how Americans enter into the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezum are going on a war march.
Yet, for Mexico, it is a real challenge to deal with more than 35 million Mexicans living in the United States.
You want to talk about enemy feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico there are winners and winners, people who offer opportunities, and others who don't.
The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio is that in some point of our family tree there was a person, maybe a parent or a relative who had an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it seems, this person responded to the profile - dark skin, poor education, the origin of poor neighborhoods, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not against Mexico.
And even though we're living in an American dream now, we're going to good schools and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we're living an American dream, not a Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It's against the United States.
And yet we know that many elite Mexicans who belong to the ruling class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating injuries and look at us as an inferior race that is not quite Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our route to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence is based on their opinion only on seduction.
If our families didn't settle in Mexico, they'd never leave her.
And now we wouldn't find ourselves trapped by a vicious attack, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who had legal access to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexico and the Mexicans because Mexico understands more about who they are and the Mexicans don't.
Although he is a citizen of the United States, he sees himself as part of two countries.
And at the same time many Mexican Americans I know don't feel part of.
We love the Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springstein.
You get the best from both countries, but you don't even have roots in one.
He's looking at us in Mexico like America.
And in the United States, we are considered to be Mexico.
And to make matters even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and some intelligence, as I learned on my trip, want to connect with the diaspora again.
They want Mexicans to work for Mexico as "premises" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American citizens how great it is to visit this country and press political leaders to establish relations with Mexico.
No, no, no, no.
That's not gonna happen.
You've reached a lot of enemies' feelings.
And thanks to the inequality of income and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that it is a great country.
I feel like it's on you guys, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not willing to forgive the United States for their dealings with Mexico a year and a half ago, it must accept that some Mexicans still do not feel the way their family members were treated in the near future.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The end of the conflict between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain foundation for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabia and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another cycle of bleeding indicates that every such accident is a nightmare.
Among the usual remains of those who began this, many buildings were transformed into towers, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most civilians, and six Israelis. The first came rockets from Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Israeli Metropolis, and the holy city Jerusalem.
But even though it seems that the Israelites and the Palestinians were involved in their ancient conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab era has changed the old order and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, have been caught in the current chaos in the region.
Perhaps this will cause their fight to be more bloodier than ever before.
However, there are reasons to think that this can prevent their dying condition.
A war that is neither won nor won.
At first glance, there seems to be no reason for optimism at present.
Even if the stop of the fires closed on November 21st, the fighting of this week would have strengthened food on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, an Islamic Hindu who has been ruling in Gaza since 2007, will claim to have led the Israelites into exile, even though Gaza has suffered defeat.
Even though some of the leaders of Hamas and the closure of 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most sad and most destructive places on earth, Israel did not allow Hamas to be destroyed.
And in fact, Hamas is having an impact on the Western coast, another castle of Palestine, which is currently controlled by its raging streams from Fatah, a more peaceful Palestinian group.
In addition, leaders of Hamas can very well argue that time is on their side.
Islamists throughout the Arab world had greater influence, so Hamas gained strong and rich friends.
Turkey, the renewed regional power, which was once the closest Muslim alliance to Israel, joined Hamas. Similarly, Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in Zaliva.
The prominent people of Hamas say that the Islamic semi-month is buried around Israel, north of Lebanon, where the ruling party/militar of Hizballah, across Syria, where the rebels, who continue to cling to Islam, can sit behind Bashar Asad, as far as Jordan, where Hamas' allies threaten the kings.
And above all, on the southern coast of Israel changed the rise of the Muslim fraternity under the leadership of President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, far from the most disadvantaged and hostile Arab country in the region.
Husní Mubarak, a secular desert who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have time for Hamas.
The Brethren, however, are brotherly Hamas and their leaders are more influential by public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may appear as a player who cannot be expelled from either Israel or the Americas.
On the contrary, the rest of the Israelites will come to the wrong conclusion.
In military terminology Hamas was put back into bed.
The Israeli anti-traumatic system of the Iron Curtain proved its price and many Hamas rockets were destroyed.
The Israelites could sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as unchallenged as ever. Many European countries have also won Hamas from the beginning of the last cycle of violence.
And especially - Israel has prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahua, the president of the government, who largely ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets from Gaza killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel was relatively calm from suicide bombers, partly because of the wall, which lies in the West Bank, the main part of what the Palestinian state may once be, and protects the Jewish territories that continue to grow in spite of their prejudice to international law.
The Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose side of Likud, at the beginning of the campaign, joined the more radical group, led by Avigdor Lieberman, was in a good position.
Why are you betraying the royal Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they were really ruling on the west coast, they wouldn't fire rockets, like they did their crowns in Gaza?
It'll be better if we keep them behind this wall and we'll knock them off when he's out of his head.
The rest of the line may win, but the Arab hierarchy can change their projections.
Although Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not have much love for Israel, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel's defence expenditure is higher than the total expenditure of all four Arab neighbours.
The launch of a new war with local superpowers will help the new Arab government to heal its economy.
The fact that President Mursi worked with President Barack Obama to achieve the stop of the ball is a good sign and can mean the beginning of something new.
The Israelites should also take a long look at the situation.
When the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, it creates a violation of the rights of the Palestinians to self-determination of the court with a gun that has to be fired one day in the areas occupied by Israel - just like the bus that exploded last week in Tel Aviv.
In the current period of repression, the situation continues to deteriorate in the Jewish state of democracy and democracy as the Arab population grows.
Blood attacks against Gaza that take place every few years for Hamas' arrest will continue to select diplomatic taxes.
Both parties need outside bids.
The answer is what wise men say on both sides, most of the outside world and these news: two states, when Israel enters the land because of security.
In the short-term view, there is little hope that stopping the ball will give external pressure at least a little more influence on the passing of this thing.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, has to stop arms supply to Gaza, has a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the opinion of the Jewish state based on borders since 1967 with the change of part of the country and shared by Jerusalem.
Arab citizens must also press on the agreement between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more for the creation of the Palestinian State than the offer without medium-term virtual state sovereignty in the UN.
President Obama also has his share in getting Israel to the governing table.
During his first election period, he forgot to present his own plan of peace.
Now, back in the White House, he seems to be equally excited at his entry into the process.
It's unfortunately short-term.
America has a vital interest in the stability of the Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and Palestine.
Australia has entered into force on the laws on various cigarettes
Inseparable green crabies, which are the same for all tobacco signs, are represented as warning for smokers and disease parts of the body.
Australia’s laws on tobacco and cigarettes, its first type of world brand, and the logo and color of the product have replaced the general olive green craze with the general image of the sick parts of the body and the appearance of children and newborns as a result of the burning of their parents.
In addition to various health warnings and images, the only difference between the signs of the label printed in the same small letter is the Saturday.
It's one of the most urgent regimes in the world with regard to tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to get young people out of smoking by releasing this crime from its appeal.
It is based on studies that show that if people don't start smoking by the age of 26, 99% is the chance that they never start smoking.
"And in very small children you can see that he understands the relationship that tobacco companies are trying to sell to them with his product," says the Federal Ministry of Health Tanya Plibersek and quotes studies that have shown that children are associated with the view of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest number of smokers in the world and changes will have only a small impact on the profits of international companies, other countries consider taking similar steps.
The tobacco industry has been heavily involved in the infringement of these laws.
Tobacco companies claimed that this law would increase trade in the black market, leading to lighter and more affordable cigarettes.
"This legislation will lead to serious adverse consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
The partners from China and Indonesia will bring a lot more of these products that will be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their trade.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for cigarettes from the silicone serving to hide uncooked scraps, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco companies lost their appeal to the Australian Supreme Court, increased almost zero sales.
Ha said Zico sold nearly 6,000 pieces to wholesalers and expected new supplies.
It's a good deal for us.
As far as possible, experts indicate the popularity of social media in the demographic group on which the plan is aimed.
According to a number of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsoring sports events and demanding that most sellers hide cigarettes in front of the direct view, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned Internet advertising by local companies and websites, however, it cannot limit foreign websites.
"If you are a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you have only this small space for the promotion of your products, it is for you online space is an unforgettable place you want to be," says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University.
Ms. Freeman noted an increase in the rating of social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, conducted by "meaning Honzo".
We have to ask ourselves, is this just a private town that really loves Marlboro cigarettes and gave you this job and created this video, or is there a marketing company involved?
The British American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry has focused on how to put new rules rather than on marketing.
The company started so far as it paid Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the attack of new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organization declare that trade is unfair, even though none of the countries with Australia are significantly involved in trade.
The implementation of the SOO Decision is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says that the government is conducting talks with other governments that consider similar laws relating to defences.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
More than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine, have now expanded.
They consider the laws of the United Kingdom, New Zealand, the South African Republic and India.
There's a lot of chicken growing in Australia.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You're going to take off your cigarette and throw your box back," says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a picture of the nose in his mouth.
Honestly, it's just one reason I quit smoking, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, claims that thanks to a single box, it's harder for him to fix it into the rules.
"It took me one hour to pay my expenses, now it takes me four hours," said Yu.
"The government should just prohibit them completely, and then we would say, 'OK, it's over, we'll close the window'," he said and stretched out his hands.
In the world of endless connections, it's not so bad to be pressured
The last day of the thank you, I was unexpectedly spending five hours at the airport when our plane was having mechanical trouble and we had to wait for another flight.
So we had a lot of time to think about the ransom.
I won't lie to you.
Waiting for half a day on the airport for the next year is a nice place to stay, even through distribution of books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts on child development continue to come with praise.
They say it's a good time to sacrifice for us (and our children) at times.
It's an incentive to go to interesting guidelines, which can support creativity.
And since most of us are still connected to some screens today, we have no chance of enjoying ourselves.
So, should we support the nude?
Yes.
Oh, no.
But I'll be right back.
For one thing, like many people, I've assumed that the offer is a relatively new wave that came with more leisure time.
But as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University of Calgary, author of the book Bored: A Live History (New History) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, he has a long history," he said.
A Latin inscription on the walls of Pompey was found on the walls of our first - century airport.
And then it's also the question of how we define the nude.
The problem is that it was defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After watching research literature and the presentation of the views of the target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined the smell as an experience "I wanted to do something that would calm me down, but I wasn't able to do it."
The offer turns out that the person is not involved in anything, but she wants to be.
He says there's no desire to do anything in the pattie.
He says that the core of the nude is "the destruction of the attention process associated with the bad cold and the feeling of slowing time."
Nuda can remember a lot of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a mutual relationship, people tend to see a problem as a medium or a world, while people who are depressed see a problem themselves.
Sometimes we think we're gonna make up for it when we're just having trouble focusing on it.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Bored in Terms of Attention", which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues taught at an earlier experiment, where participants listened to the tape that the person read from the magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and independent television program in the nearby rooms, others heard it so excited that they almost looked at it while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who listened to the television program were more nervous than the other two groups -- they had problems with focusing, but they were not sure why and did not subscribe to these problems.
If you are trying to focus on a difficult or boring task, you can pay attention to the award, said Mark J. Fensk, professor of neuroscientist at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, "like looking for the wrong parts on the factory line, you can ask music to help you avoid getting upset."
In fact, he said, we now know that the bending and cutting, which is often viewed as a sign of excitement, can actually help with the offer to fight and keep people physically more alert.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to return to their homes will learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit quietly," said Professor Fenska.
We've all had an accident - my flight's delay, a shooting player, especially a long film.
But some individuals have a greater chance of getting bored than others.
In the 1980s, scientists developed the "Bored Proneness Scale" (Boredom Proneness Scale).
The table contains questions like, "Many things I have to do are repeated and it's monotonous," and "I have so much interest that I don't have time to do everything."
With these levels, scientists have found that boys tend to sacrifice more often than girls, Stephen Vodanov said, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and especially if there is a need to have more and more external incentives.
However, teenagers are generally not successful.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents about seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of adults indicated that they were offered at school and at home, while 23 percent indicated that they were offered when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents indicated that they were offered.
Professor Larson pointed out that he did not know whether the percentage statement of vows would be now 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said he knew that "sing is a high time for the wedding," which is to a great extent caused by the fact that children and young people are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question, "Is the gift good for you?"
As research shows, sometimes no, because in its extreme form it can lead people to become subject to absurd physical risks, to play gambling games, or to abuse conventional substances as a way to solve them.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between evolution and evolution, said Professor Vodanov, who had studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Nude is a way of the brain how to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the most appropriate thing you should do here.
If you offer and use this energy to play guitar and cooking, it will make you happy.
If you watch TV, however, it will only make you happy for a moment, not a long time.
So if your child offers himself and you give him an iPad, he won't offer himself anymore, but he won't learn how to have fun or just run, Professor Fenska said.
And "This self-control is transferred from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child learns not only how to have fun but also how to gain greater self - control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate Christmas.
But we shouldn't even be too critical against her.
Our goal should be to feel more comfortable when we reach the achievement of continuous pressures of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse her of the need to offer more, but the offer is sick, unsatisfied to be connected with something reasonable," he said.
What people really are looking for, he said, is how to relax and enjoy free time.
"In the middle where we're constantly overstimulating," he said, "it's hard to find ways to have fun when the game goes off."
There is no manual on the new marijuana law in Colorado
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a student at a high-tech school and a footballist from South East Colorado, is accused of criminal acts for something that will soon take place in the entire state of law - for holding several grams of marijuana and smoke that he used to burn.
Mr. Orozco said that one summer day he went with several friends in Lamar, on the plains of the border with Kansas when he was stopped.
After the police found him in Marihana's car, Mr. Orozco was called for drugs and equipment for drug use - minor offenses in which he was charged with 100 USD - and he was sentenced to a date of trial.
"They treated us like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But he's a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks following the coloured vote on the legalization of the small number of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of less drug cases is more local than the law.
The number of cases of arrest proceedings for marijuana has already been resolved here and in Washington, which has adopted similar measures.
The police department ceased to charge adults aged 21 years and elders for keeping a small number legally allowed after the law has entered into force in the weeks ahead.
But in more conservative areas of Colorado, the complainants declared that they would continue with existing cases involving marijuana and still accuse people of being held.
At the same time, several cities from the province of Antwerp, with a view to the Western Hemisphere, voted to ban the opening of new, licensed trades with marijuana in their villages.
"This concern is developing so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Heads of wood and regulators in Washington State.
And they are looking for guidelines on how to set up a licensing system for production, distribution and sale - all until 1 December 2013.
They say Colorado, either in good or in bad, is in front of most states in marijuana regulation, first for medical use and now also for recreation.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, a speech council for the distribution of licences for the sale of alcohol in Washington State.
But as Mr Smith agreed, no place or system can do more than suggest what could work.
"There is no real precedent that we could manage," he said.
The Washington Law, i.e. I-502, acquires the effect of December 6th, which also leaves the annual vacuum, during which there will be no state licensing system yet, but legal detention.
And there are hidden mechanical questions that must be resolved during this period, such as to consider the State directive on "relevant approach" to licensed marijuana with its trade ban up to 330 metres from school, parks, child crime or child welfare.
"Never will it be more difficult to place a licensed trade with knopi than in the urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Centre for Legal Cnopi, recently founded research groups.
On 21 November, police chief Oates sent his officers from Aurora, informing them that the city's complainant would no longer delay the arrest of a small number of marijuanas in every 21-year-old town and that the police "with immediate impunity" will stop accusing people of these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police would pass on the city laws regulating drug dealers of marijuana and that drug dealers and dealers would continue to be silenced.
During the Weld period in northern Colorado, the district prosecutor Ken Buck is showing a closer look.
Following the vote, he stated that his office would continue to reduce marijuana detention cases, mostly as a way to pressure users to seek treatment.
At the present time, the charge of 56 grams or less is met with 119 people, although many of them are charged with another charge.
"Our office is obliged to remove a criminal prosecution which was criminal at the time it came," Mr Buck said in his statement.
The reaction was also complex in places, such as the foreign era of Mesa, where the volunteers rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the period, is not responsible for holding a small number.
The Regional Prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided not to ignore all ongoing cases of detention.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing law enforcement until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of the Colored Volunteers supported the measures, the introduction of recreational marijuana to government and the legal system will never be easy.
And the counter-reactions against the state revealed in view of this great state-wide green experiment of deep satisfaction between local officials.
For the prosecutors, this is a "cultural barrier", said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who is accused of holding marijuana, and local speakers of the National Organization for the Reform of the Laws concerning marijuana.
"They used so much of their lives to attract people that they still can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to which the small number of marijuana becomes alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the best road to become national drug legalization testing cases.
Lawyers and state authorities plan new boundaries for legalised sales and at the same time eagerly await instructions from the federal government, who is still planning to consider the sale and prosecution of marijuana for federal crimes.
Lawyers of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will break up.
In spite of several arrests by marijuana vendors for medical purposes and patients who took care of it, the majority of the federal government has left business with marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other countries in operation.
While anti-drug agents will probably not open the door to contain a small drug package, it is likely that they will be able to create the state of regulated transactions with marihuan authorized new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, former adviser to the anti-drug policy of President Obama.
Several coloured cities do not wait for federal authorities to proceed.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana trade, even though it will last about a year before the power of any trade can be opened.
Last week Montrose proposed a six-year ban on the west of the state and is likely to enter into force next week.
"We don't want to get into a situation when we give someone a license and then we'll have a lot of federal business," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our people voted against this addition.
We're looking at what the people voted for, and we're talking about what they're voting for.
There's really a lot of questions here.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was brought out of Oxford because I'm a conservative."
In their opinion, only today's university students are attacked.
I don't remember ever having a study at Oxford University.
Like my father, my older brother studied at the university, which I thought was the world's largest science center, a modern dedicated Greek symposium that stimulates two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And while I was at the end of the 80th century, two weeks after I went to Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, dug the suitcases, and went back to my first life scandal.
My father was screaming and crying.
My friends were confused.
Danik Evening Standard claimed that I gave it up because I had intentions against the love of students in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson publicly declared that I was leaving because I was forced to drink from the broken jars.
It's true she was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I escaped because I was the subject of systematic schizophrenia and fear.
Not because of my weird name or the fact that I came from private school.
I was chased for the only reason and in this bike of thought enlightenment it was as rich as the barbaric: my father, who was blind Woodrow Wyatt, was a highly appointed adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I to the Conservative Party.
You can ask yourself why I'm doing this until now.
Just because the latest reports indicate that the new generation of students is currently suffering from similar traceability.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students took the same protections of equal rights as gays, health professionals and ethnic minorities.
The Conservative Membership of Young People's Association (JCR) at Corpus Christi College states that because of their political views, they are "often isolated, exposed to personal attacks and are exposed to the fact that they are not welcomed".
They call for the creation of a position in the university committee for equal opportunities, which would ensure that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation did not help even the recently mentioned BBC TV series Two with the name Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right about the student political action that the conservatives considered to be partial and non-innocent.
In the series was presented by an absolute Joe Cooke, former president of Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who was driving Rolls-Royc, wearing a tie and wearing a helmet.
In other high schools, conservative students say that they have been treated as "sacrifices".
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice-president of Nottingham University Conservative Association (Conservative Association of Nottingham University), told the Sunday news that "the left-wing effect on universities is growing.
People think we're like Bullingdon Club without even meeting with us."
One-hundred-year-old historian on Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who stands for greater protection, says that such a climate is "unacceptable", while nine-year-old elected president OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that access to JCR members to people from the centre has resulted in a deterioration.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate, as well as to the good living conditions of the members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I grew up in September 1986, 18 years old, and in a protective way.
The hatred against the Conservative Party was the most bitter.
A year ago, the university voted to refuse the award of a title title by former student Margaret Thatcher, for the reasons of failure to finance high school.
From the atmosphere, the Stalinists would also be worried.
During the first few days of the initial week when new students met each other and with the professors, I was able to enjoy the ticket he had to come.
I found out not only the professors of medicine agree to conservative jokes, but he also feels involved.
The policy of horny movements, privatization and support of the government against the sanctions against apartheid in the South African Republic was introduced to the forest.
My first speech was about translating the French text from the 18th century into English and what followed, I was not prepared.
"Mr. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt, "please refer to the first paragraph."
I've had enough of that.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like a dorsal body, was very sensitive.
"The Thatcherovs refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students were ignored.
To my eyes, the tears of my eyes.
"I propose that you take some basic lesson in French in your free time, so if you are not too busy with social affairs," said Professor Pitt.
I'm so tired I'm back in my room.
At night at school, I sat alone when I felt a slight fall on my shoulder.
He was a student of the second anniversary of James, who represented himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said sadly.
I'm sorry.
Anyone who suspects condomism is the target.
It's too bad for me, but he knows your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be even worse for you.
Most of the condoms suggest they're workers.
Later in the local house, I tried to pretend.
I kept saying that I wouldn't agree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be a failure.
A first-year student of the field of philosophy, politics and economy, who (such as irony) went to Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're under orders.
The other students took notes with him.
I've been back, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" asked one.
It's one of them, isn't it?
I felt the way they had to feel gay before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Can I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have had to deal with people who were just thinking about dating?
Should I change into a labyrinth and put on my natural scarves?
Three years ago, they developed to clean up ignorance and isolation.
Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who sat at my college, was the only conservative professor.
He was hated not only because he's conservative but also because he's counsellor Margaret Thatcher for foreign policy and one of those who write statements.
He wasn't there.
He hated this place for his provinciality and minorityness and for his example of Marxist-Deterministic view of history.
In 1997 he attended the position of a professor at the University of Bilkent in Turkish Ankara.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to get from Oxford to my parents' home in London, looking for shelter in my busy metropolis friends and family.
I told my dad I hate Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the four-year period, all political views were adopted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dreams.
Even my communist friends always had perfect ways.
His blind eyes were smiling.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
With frequent trips to London, my silence has deteriorated.
My friend, also the Conservative Party host, was under pressure and gave up his conviction.
The following week during the study, when another professor of history declared me to be a "enemy of people", I decided to do the same.
Even though I was in the red studio, I admitted that my parents had brain cancer, and I called it "old crazy."
It was just a short time ago.
My father, my father, was in charge of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two booklets every week to Murdoch's newspaper.
My door was locked.
I got baptized inside, and after five minutes, my followers gave it up.
When they left, I went to pick up the blanket and caught the first train to London.
I've never been back.
You can call me a fucking weak guy.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be in the educational institution subject to such fear and greed.
Even more tragic, though, is that it was Oxford, which not only took 14 conservative primers, but also conceals itself today as an undeserved history of places with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino has a better elegance than glory"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: master of fashion", which was launched this week in London, ABC spoke to Naty Abascalov, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemiss and other famous Italian designer customers.
Somerset House, an old residence of Isabely I. English, is the only place in the British capital to host Valentina Garavani's exhibition.
The author confirmed this at the beginning of the famous retrospective "Valentino: master fashion design", which represents more than 130 models of high-end fashions created by his workshop over the last 50 years.
"This castle I worship," he says with his irreplaceable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il Signor" Garavani is the only protagonist that could not be written without his valuable clients.
Valentino has always felt motivated by the rare and distant world of aristocraticism.
The first hall of exhibition, which runs until March 3rd, is surrounded by a private correspondence and photography with the signatures of the most important sleighs, from Princess Salimy Aga Chan through the English Princess Marie-Cantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino presents these personal memories as the trophies of his social approach: from the simple crater from Voghera to northern Italy to the idol of the international "bohemic munitions".
Having love for the royal family is not bad.
"They're at least not a bunch of cigarettes into a great cup of cigarettes, as some beautiful pop-music celebrities do," says Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemiss.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in Alpach and were good friends.
Valentino is a traditional guest and guests have a lot of fun and elegance.
"All of us were very pleased when we were invited to his chat in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife "Heini" Thyssen and a close friend of forgotten beauty like Marella Agnelius or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino always had a better elegance than glory.
And yet there is a star from it."
Valeria Mazzov's chairman, Valentina
At the charisma the proposal is not even forgotten by Valeria Mazzov's Argentinian model.
"It's been many years since we've been visiting Piazza di Spagna in Rome for one night.
We were 20 and Sharon Stone and John Kennedy were younger.
In every little part of his apartment, entertainment, food, music, he was excited and felt his spirit.
All the calls made him feel important and loved," recalls the top model that started working with him during the Paris Week High Mode in 1995.
"He will never come out of fashion because his proposals are artistic works," he concludes.
A review of the urgency
A saved life is not a story of adventure, but of truly repeated love.
He loves people with good manners and better titles and they love him.
One of somerset House's gallery was stopped at a personal 70-metre-long passport that offers a change of role: a visitor changes to the model and walks through the passport to observe the "obscenity" of dreams that Valentin's mysterious work as a dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume she had in her own Monica Vitttie in "Night", or a cup of wool and leather that belonged to Emperor Farah Dibao.
In the public the manicure is named Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria from Thurn and Taxi, Mette-Marit Norská, Rosario Bulharská or Sophie Habsburg.
Naty Bascal and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "Don't forget about him."
"I remember it perfectly.
They were calhodes, shirts, gillettes, and saco from the 1971-1972 underground collection.
It was a gift he did for me," says Naty Bascal, one of the designer's mice.
"I give him the other priority for his femininity and great love for women because it sustains our beauty," adds the former leader from Ferii.
"I really like the colors that he uses, that make a lot of sense and give the "jiskrus" faces.
Proportions are perfect."
No princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovanpaola d'Arenberg can forget how Valentina first wore.
When she grew up and lived in Italy, she used to be full-time and had the opportunity to dress one of her dinners...
She finally arrived at the end of the 1990s.
"I bought my first dress from Valentine for the opportunity of celebrating my cousin's home, Princess Edouarda de Ligne.
These were red clothes that had to be dressed with bells, twisted animals, and shoulderless surfaces.
It was a dream that became reality," says the widow after Rodrigu d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is flexible to fashion, his hair is excessive," explains the Italian aristocratic, whose life differs between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has a set of designer wedding dress "very nice... because dress is not just dress, it is also a memory file that they have in them."
"King" mode
The golden crown of exhibitions in Somerset House are the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding with Paul Greek in 1995.
For the creation of these colorful slonovin-coloured tents with all the pearls, twelve types of different regions and the train length of four and a half metres were needed for four and 25 months of work and "cholek" (as the designer of his candles).
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the largest authorities of the specialized press, represent these dress limits of the top mode at the end of the 20th century, "turning customers from high companies".
Valentino is now the best example of the summer's elite "savour-étre".
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (highest label in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Letres and marked by a series of Honorary legends gathers as many as any of his clients' wives.
"My attention has always attracted his choice, calm, adjusted and perfect view," admitted Princess d'Arenberg.
"I last saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with the Count Jacqueline de Ribes, my big friend.
He was unconscious, and time left no trace of him."
When she says it's princess...
The world's toughest puzzle: wears cheese in the Kawah Ijen soup area
For four euros, the Indonesian syllables will have their lives and their health when they weigh 70 kilograms of cheese down to the hard stones.
They are people whose work is in vain, and they are the ones who work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 climbers who make their living by getting cheese from Kawah Ijen to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this reason, every day it must be carried to the bottom of the crater, which avoids acid rain from the inside of the Earth, and when contacting the air, it passes into a steady state.
After a large block of cheese that weighs up to 70 pounds [70 kg], it takes it to the shoulder in two bamboo bags after the hard stone steps.
At the top of the top of the tower, which is 2,386 feet [2,386 m], it is only 250 meters, but the loaded loads last more than 40 minutes than they are exposed to the fierce storm above because they maintain balance and basically weigh their steps so that they do not break up and fall into ruin.
He knows that any setback could be a life like that of a French tourist who got off Kawah Ijen a year ago.
Kawah Ijen makes five cents per kilogram of cheese that weighs
When they are upstairs, they cross the road by tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in the circus, and suddenly carry heavy bones to the weight that the lower part of the company has placed, at a sea height of 1850 meters.
It is about PT Candi Grymbi, which has been a heavy burden since 1960 and has never paid its employees more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilogram.
Then he sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this growth has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of perfumes, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamites and even sugar whites.
"Because it usually carries 70 kilos, we make about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) per trip," explains Anto, who usually completes three trips a day.
One trip takes him three hours and is finally destroyed, but he can make 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) a day.
Even though it's as an affront to such a neilish effort, it's a triad of what he would do on the field.
"The daily sight of the mountain is very high here. For example, for the collection of coffee, 15 000 rupees (1,2 euros) are paid per day and the payment for fourteen days is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains a carrier who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a wall.
There he paid 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and work was not so hard, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, near the village of Sophs, for a serious reason that is as convincing as the cheese in Indonesia: "I married a young girl from Bali who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, he has a bad breath, he's always coughing and his eyes are contaminated with toxic gases.
In his 27-year-old, Anto has three times a day risking life in Kawah Ijen, whose cheese has already begun to choose its tax, although she has a face protected by special mask and glasses.
He's got asthma, he's having a bad breath, he's always in pain, and his eyes are obsessed with toxic gases that keep him out of the soups.
It's the price he has to pay for getting his dream.
"I will work for another two years because I want to open the shop or study Spanish or French," promises more than an existing English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man brought up in court could be a tourist guide, a reader or a receptionist at the hotel, and instead he does the work of the worker.
He shares a spinal wooden hat with other wearers and rises every day in two hours in the morning, because the cheese does not cease to grow in the night and its characteristic yellow color changes in the blue and dark.
And through the surrounding darkness, Anto gets into the crater and lights up the road with a little light that has been added to the cave and bought it for his own money.
About 400 loads are poured on the shoulder of the basket with cheese from the bottom of the crater.
Although the company has high income, the heavy burden of supporting costs has not been offset, nor does it provide the burden on the workers working on their own and with such effort, no equipment.
In fact, they do not receive part of the 30 000 rupees (2,5 euros) from the photography supplement, which together with the introduction of 15 000 rupees (1,2 euros) choose the natural park monitors from tourists who come to photograph the soup and its human molluscs.
"This work is for gain, not for people," says Madrusin, a state-owned 42-year-old wearer who has been working in Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left school.
He has the power to raise up up to 110 pounds and assures us that he will keep working, "as far as he can go", because he needs money to teach his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to bed, I'm going to die here because the soup was my whole life.
Even though the cheese burns the throat and lips in the eyes, when the wind suddenly turns around and the hills in the thick clouds that emerge from the soups, the tops are so strong that none of them complains of suffering from serious disabilities... it is evident from their frequent respiratory problems, arthrosis, knee pain, and wounds caused by severe bone loss.
The unainik, who weighs his horse on the back, can weigh only 50 kilograms in his 53 years.
Each day, he and his colleagues release 15 tons of cheese, and then three trucks carry a narrow road between the woods to the roof of Tamarsari, 18 miles away.
"I'm not going to sleep, I'm going to die here because the soup was my whole life," declares Unainik and opens up the wide mouth in which a few teeth are missing.
Of his five sons, he is the oldest, thirty years old, and he also works for the rape of a lion.
Time is running out, but the constant existence of one of the most difficult puzzles in the world remains from generation to generation - puzzles that perform human moles in Kawah Ilen.
Singapore sells babies to save the economy
Singaporeans claim they don't have children, careers, stress and cost of living and education.
"The population of Singapore needs growth."
I'm married and I'm the owner, you're my wife and you're the owner.
It may seem unbelievable that this composition is part of advertising on mentole-bonds, but still - or perhaps just because - video from the beginning of this year in Singapore was massively expanded on YouTube.
These candles are part of a rap that uses local scratches of the type "dome box to dust" as an excellent measure of fertility in Singapore.
The BBH advertising agency, which created the video, hopes that this advertising will be able to alert them in a funny way.
The artistic director of the agency Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the influence of music in order to fulfill his "citizenship".
"It's a great deal about Internet involvement, so it had to be fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we should feel it's the subject we have to touch.
We knew that the government tried a lot of things like expanding perfumes with pheromones or organizing a list of parties.
Many of these ideas may have been quite complicated, but not completely functional.
So we've been thinking why don't do the most creative thing here, like making a rap, to solve this problem."
1,2 children
The one who doesn't take it very much on a light weight is the Singapore government.
Each year, it spends $1,300 on boosting citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 for the child, grants maternity leave and grants financial taxes.
All these measures had a small effect.
Singapore is a rich city state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known as the conservativeism of its representatives and strict social controls.
The rate of birth in Singapore with respect to citizenship is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The latter exceeded the rate of birth of value 2, which was considered to be reimbursed in 1976.
Why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Mingo, head of the Committee on Marriage and Family of the National Population Authority, says it is due to "better education" and "largest career opportunities".
"People thus have a wider range of opportunities, with regard to the goals and priorities of life, is not just wedding and family," he explains.
These changes in Community standards have contributed to the increase in the number of free people and to the redundancies of marriage and children. As a result, the decline in birth rates in Singapore is a result.
While immigration policies have had a dramatic effort to increase the number of immigrants as a measure against the decline in the population, this has caused hostility among local citizens.
On some Singapore websites, it is seen as unhindered xenophobic against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and little effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also considered as one of the reasons why the government of Singapore has recorded its worst voluntary outcome since the beginning of independence last year.
After the elections, the problem was identified using quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected Results
While the decline in fertility rates has a known impact on national economic growth, tax revenues, health expenditure and immigration policy, in the case of Singapore, there have also been some unexpected results.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, she began to influence trade with property.
The City Development Authority has begun to regulate the number of small apartments known as "bots" that can be established in certain urban areas.
These apartments have a area of 46 square metres and have great success in sales.
However, he is concerned that these apartments can support young life-styles and reflect developers to build large homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, manager-general of the El Developers development company, claims that their "bots" are sold far faster than larger houses.
"They're more popular, and so they're selling from day to week faster than house with larger space.
That's why our money flow is much better."
However, it will be agreed that new standards are clearer for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
You're getting stressed.
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could lead to an increase in the population's fertility rate, the discussions with Singapore workers in the financial quarter in the city centre indicate that they will not have a major impact.
"People are still in stress, homes are expensive, just like education, which is why many people complain," says the young official.
"The rest of them have children.
But it's important for me to rely on my own money and time," says another, about twenty-year-old, young.
Men and women mention careers, stress and the cost of living and education as reasons for protecting them from having children.
So if the government tries to force citizens to have children, they are the same end of Singapores who have the last word of the family.
What is private online is private and online
I'm sorry.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is a matter of personal opinion or of "the area of private life which has every right to protect against any breach".
What's private for a 16-year-old?
How does this definition apply in everyday life and on social networks?
Do you understand the danger that is presented when it publishes information on the Internet that would certainly not tell anyone in normal communication?
Newspapers from ElPeriodico spoke to five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years of age, who were the most common users on the Internet.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy as "all of its own" in a personal level and as "user's name and password" if it referred to a social network.
"I would not disclose my greatest secret," said 10-year-old Jorge in an effort to explain the importance of privacy at places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"They're very secret, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world," she says.
"I give the FB beautiful photos or photos as we play.
I'll talk to those who are familiar with it.
I wouldn't share a photo that wouldn't be mine, or a photo that would make someone laugh," she says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscenity photographs, photographs of naked persons or photographs of crimes, or to write down or commentaries.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends who have FB and his nine subscribers on Twitter.
Most of them are friendly.
There's a mother with a name and a password from one of the accounts.
"I have set up an account on Twitter so that I can express my views and write interesting contributions.
I don't know if anyone answers me, I'm just giving them that," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to friends who are away or communicate quickly with friends," she says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended him to someone unknown.
The case of Joseph's fourteenth is different.
This teenser owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask and on the last mentioned network that he doesn't know 20 people from his list of friends.
"I'm not afraid of that, because we have something common, for example, music," she says.
According to this guy, none of them used him for anything, nor did he want a address or a phone number.
"If they're urging me or asking me to leave, they'll just be removed from their account," he admits.
José reported to Ask after reading his Twitter recommendations.
This boy is not a strange experience with what is called cyberbulleying today.
"A well-known friend on the social network was published.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never found out who it was," he confirms.
According to José, the victim didn't report from the account.
"You've only activated a private regime."
Then it explains a series of steps, how the account is safe to set up.
Unlike George, this boy would publish photos of people known in unpleasant or tragic situations.
"Of course I would have done that if someone had guided me or just wanted me.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate of the High School and Education School, has to make sure that children and adults in social networks are properly oriented, they must understand that the main purpose of these networks is to inform them.
It states: "The Internet has become a means of searching for information, but when the social network appeared, the rules of the games have changed."
Marrios Porras notes that academic worker Marc Prensky, a graduate of the University of Yale and author of the article Digital Homer and Digital Drivers, introduced these ideas to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born in the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who need to teach them, and then we learn ourselves," she says.
It explains that it is a complex theme, "because we ask them to know what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, in the age at which they are not grown up."
Also, to be - with regard to the environment - reasonable, in a time when what is most expensive is to be loved, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences," he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adults what is private is to ask questions that are needed to think about.
"Tell them not to do anything, it doesn't work," he adds.
Dále Marriolos Porras mentions some of the options: Are there things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or: Would you like someone to publish your photo like you did to your friend?
You know what others say about you?
When you mark the people on the photos of the holiday, did you ask them for permission?
And one more: Do everyone need to know what you're doing?
The next point is to find out that they have to act in the middle of the Internet as well as outside it.
They're the same rules.
"A person is guided by respect, morality and other principles outside the Internet and should be on social networks," he says.
View
Esturado Guardia, a university professor, teacher at the first level and educator explains that it is important that parents carefully read the rules of social networks.
"If they understand each pregnancy, they have a good basis for talking to their children about the consequences that the online account can have.
For example, concerning age or what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
Guardia is of the view that it is key to remind children of the traditional rule of "not talking to strangers".
Summity South America is over and the Declaration from Lima has not been published
The sixth summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru today ends without the publication of the Declaration from Lima, which was announced and which was clearly signed by the seven incoming presidents.
The Efe Agency has repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur organisation, but representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Presidential Offices, who initially decided that the document would be published after the end of the summit, indicated that it would be published later on the Peruvian Government website.
They further indicated that the content was published by Peruvian President Ollantou Humal in several short press releases.
The journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video from the Presidential Meeting was transmitted to the press rooms with a message of "confidential meeting, the transmission of the sound is closed".
The small amount of information available to journalists was provided by some government press speakers who were attending, however, never by Peruvian speakers.
The only document published during the meeting was a list of participants with the presidents, which did not allow hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more information.
Later, the Peruvian Presidential Office sent an e-mail with a "final statement" from the summit, but it was only about the statement of President Humala, not about the official document that closed the summit.
The last round hosted Peru's third summaries of the South American and Arab countries (America del Sur-Paises Árabes, ASPA) and even on this occasion the Declaration from Lima was not originally published, although it was strictly required.
On official ASPA pages it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities were required to ensure that all journalists were sent, but they were totally limited in accessing information.
The summit concluded, among other things, a joint commitment between Chile and Peru to the decision of the Hague Court of Justice, which resolves the dispute on the border between the two countries.
President Peru Ollanta Humala and President Chile Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decisions of the International Court of Justice in Haagu, which will begin with the opening of a statement of objection by both sides to the dispute that started with Lima against Santiago.
"We will try and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute which we are facing today in this international court," said President Humala with his Chilean opposition.
"The Chile has been, it is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international courts," Piñera added and congratulated President Humalu with a strong hand in the train of both countries.
Both presidents confirmed that the decision of the International Court of Justice had been published after Colombia had adopted the Bogotá Pact this week, which expressed detail to the decisions of the International Court of sea borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered this decision to be completely incorrect.
The summit was held without the participation of Presidents of Brazil (Dilma Roseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchnervá).
Paraguay was expelled from the Unasur organization in 2011 following the resignation of the current President, Fernando Luga, and the meeting was not attended.
The hotel president Ollanta Humala was entrusted with the opening of morning talks and the closing of the summit in Lima shortly after Sunday.
The president read the final document informing that 16 agreements had been adopted and that 31 projects between South American countries had been planned with investments of 17 billion dollars.
In addition to the agreements adopted, the Member State of the UNHCR will take "the important steps leading to the objectives of the South American population for which housing agreements have been extended".
He reported that actions have been promoted to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil security and international organised crime, better access to drugs and cheap internet in all South America camps and joint and effective measures against natural disasters".
When Europe is in crisis, "there is no economic consolidation (Latin America) on a winning basis, it must serve to expand our productivity and show our people a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to prioritise a group of 31 symbolic projects that improve transport connections between different parts of South America, particularly the rural and rural areas... in order to improve our country's integration and create new economic ties," said the Peruvian president in a speech.
He said that five of these projects were related to Peru and the historical eights of its territory from the border to Brazil, and two other related to better relations with Ecuador, however, he did not provide more details.
The final document also touched the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve as its return to the Union of South American nations," from which it is currently excluded.
Another concern that the summit had raised was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area, which is unique and has a good neighbourly relationship.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before his participation in the regional meeting, he hoped that on Saturday in Mexico, he would meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, so that they would proceed with respect to the judgment of the International Court of Justice concerning the sea border which is disputed by Bogotou.
"It is possible to meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We agree with all the solutions, no one is excluded, no contract with Nicaragua, which would require contact with this country," he stressed.
"I hope that I will be able to say to the President of Orgets that we will be able to lead to the most civilized and the most visible form possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they are to take part in the inauguration of the Enrique Penñi Niety.
In the context of the summit, the Union Defence Ministers met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which reinforces dialogue and consensus on defence issues.
UNASUR members are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the last country mentioned is currently excluded.
Peru is a temporary president of this regional block.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a common population is a goal in which South America, in this case, must learn from Europe.
Correa, who participated in the sixth presidential summit of the United States of America (Unasur) in Lima, stated on state TV Peru that the Europeans "were killed by World War II" and in other conflicts, "but are now practically one government".
In this regard, the project of creating a South American population supported by the Member State of the Unasur organisation was highlighted.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country that already exists between members of the Andean Community must be targeted, however, there are still back-to-back areas that want to bring us back to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian President also stated that he agreed with the re-composition of the Organization of American States (OAS) provided that it would reduce the impact of the Anglo-Secrets and take steps towards those who signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
"Those who are in the head are never bound to anything, and we the Jiho-Americans are all signing.
It is impossible to understand that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission is funded in Washington by the United States," stated in a statement on political asylum provided by Ecuador's co-founder WikiLeaks Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that this decision did not violate its principles and respected its "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at that time "there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange could be issued to a third country without regard to the ongoing process".
In addition, he criticized the Swedish court, which asked him to make an opinion on a particular sexual offence in the Swedish territory, while "the Swedish legislation itself allows for the presentation to be made by a video conference talk that could be held from the Ecuadorian high school in London".
Correa said there is a risk that Assanga will be affected by physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him for a while, what's on our anniversary, but I was very excited to be informed that he's had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of state.
"But it's dangerous that his physical and mental condition gets worse because he's locked up in a small space without the possibility of moving to a clean air.
This would mean everyone's health," he added.
President Correa noted that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange from June to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on the basis of a permit to travel to Ecuador was in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and the European Courts, and stressed that the discussions were held with London in order to resolve the detention of WikiLeaks.
"We do not agree on human rights, we do not use such a word in this case, but we still have discussions.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and the European Courts, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón is conducting a series of proceedings at various European institutions," he said.
He said, "If the Great Britain leaves tomorrow, it's all over."
And if Swedish Mr. Assange will listen to an Ecuadorian referendum in London or through Skype, how it allows foreign legislation without a problem, and how it has been implemented in other cases, tomorrow this problem will be over."
Correa used this situation to present himself as a defence of freedom of expression and explained that he strongly did not tolerate "meaning, wrong thoughts and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
We are not the biggest enemies of the free press, we are corrupt and corrupt policies, even bad journalists in profit services, pressures and exploitation," he said.
From this point of view, he expressed his joy that neither the journalists, nor the bankers, nor the hegemon countries nor the bourgeoisies, do not govern Ecuador, and he said that if he is re-elected, "he will continue in the changes to the right path and the right direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to continue to maintain the veto expressed by Paraguay on membership in the Union of Unasur at least to its next elections and argued that the objective "must be strong and not tolerate opportunism and puncimus based on legality" because in fact "has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy".
In addition, the Ecuadorian President stated that he considered "the absolutely appropriate" request of his Colombian nephew Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, at the time of the International Court of Justice in Haagu, which decided in favour of Nicaragua.
At the moment, the judgment is not accepted.
"It's a problem between South America and Central America.
Conflicts are inevitable, but the will to step together needs to be overcome.
They need to be judged by the width so that they can be overcome and have the opportunity to go ahead."
He also expressed his hope in comparing the dispute on the maritime border, which was resolved in the same Court of Justice of Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek an international court if both countries are committed to take a decision, be it tough."
With regard to the possibility of candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to be held in order already on the third term, he noted that he took this opportunity "with great optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa declared that if the elections were to be won in October 2013, it would leave public life.
"My personal interest has never been very much, but an unfair situation such as the socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be managed by political power.
My political ambition believed that I was the one who promises this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I were to win, it would be my last presidential period and then I would leave politics.
When we win, he's waiting for me.
I've already decided," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new health care treatment of Venezuelan President Huga Cháveze in Cuba.
"I just talked to Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolas Madurem, who says President Chávez went to planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign was finished.
There is no doubt about a relapse in the president's health status," he explained.
Today, the head of the Ecuadorian State participated in the sixth summit of the Heads of State and Government of the South American Nations (Unasur), which was completed by challenges to greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equity and security.
Victims of AIDS are today due to background diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when his test results were confirmed: HIV positive.
"It's like a blizzard hits me," she reports at the moments of the truth that the doctor tried to "fuck up a bit," but apparently without success.
That's a boy in front of his family.
He decided to take his disease himself on his own and started to inform her about it, and with such a discovery that he was already celebrating 43rd birthdays.
It is certainly one of the most recent HIV patients in Guadalajara (HCG) in the Civil Hospital, which came in 1994 after several battle with disabilities.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency (HIV) virus for 22 years, which has been something invisible at the beginning of the 1990s, when there were many doubts, little treatment options and more progress.
At that time, neither was the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS), "because he had a serious injury".
That's when I had AIDS was a sonic death.
Now it's possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are many people who do not know about their disability and arrive when the virus causes the body’s damage and strengthens the immune system, and then become victims of appropriate infections.
31 years since the world's outbreak of AIDS, or at least from the first documented cases, "it means great success that the long life of a patient who starts treatment in time and in an appropriate manner is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, who led the HIV Unit in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, stating that this information was confirmed in the depth of the year in a prestigious scientific publication.
HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS is not a cause of death, but that the duration of survival and full-value life depends on the degree of achievement of the immune system of patients who are disease-diagnosed, while those who do not use drugs are better off: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells up to 50 years.
Simply stated, the person who has been diagnosed with HIV at 25 years of age may, according to these findings, "live without problems up to 75 years of age" explained in a doctor’s discussion.
It is appropriate to note that the average life span of Mexicans is now 76 years.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years and Mexico has reduced the number of people who died of AIDS from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS Joint Programme for HIV/AIDS) it is also true that 60 per cent of patients have died from the AIDS phenomenon.
Only 255 people died in Jalisco in 2011 and until the annual harvest of 187. However, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured since 2005.
- Why do people still die from the effects of disabilities?
- "I don't think the problem is in access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happens in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we have not exhausted resources. The problem is that patients are coming in a very advanced stage because they don't know the condition of the ban, or in the late phase of disability."
It adds convincing data: "Nine out of ten patients are coming when there is already some associated infection. The only thing we need to do in order to affect the overall mortality is the disease to be diagnosed early, and therefore, in a large measure, it is necessary to offer tests to detect the disability of all the people who ask for them."
In its proposal, specialists and officials from the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco state and directly with patients such as Fabrizio, who have come to test the private laboratory only because he has done this to his friend, and through his minor age, he has already suffered from AIDS and also suffered from Capio’s sarcoma, inherited disease, which is one of the most common complications.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're dead, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm gonna die, I'd rather go out three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was better, they're healthy, they're funny, I'm taking medication."
To this day his parents know only that he was suffering from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sexual life, but I pay attention to myself and to the other person," Fabrizio, who accepted the challenge to share his experience with Billenio JALISCO, to motivate those who are afraid of him today, as part of the World Day of AIDS.
"Let them do tests. If they're risking, so know what they're doing first, if they're positive, it's better, and if they're already diagnosed, let's know they can live like anyone else when they're responsible."
This report records the password of the fight against AIDS in the year 2012.
Portable condoms
Among health programs and ordinary citizens, there is a great disaster, said Ricardo Salazar, a guadala journalist who provides information on HIV virus.
And the biggest mercenaries are in prevention.
In places where this task is believed to be "the real increase in the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, today they give us packages and these condoms, which are very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the quickest to the new orders are growing.
"What do you want to do?" is the usual question of irony and consideration from social workers, school counselors, medical staff and medical personnel who want to avoid it, says the reporter.
He proposed that this ineffective distribution be changed, not just by the pulses, but by the hundreds in the dosages in public toilets, in places where young people often walk.
"It's not promiscuity support.
It doesn't even matter how Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he would agree with the distribution of condoms in his period.
It's not that kind of sexuality; it's best to access the condoms of those who already lead sexual life," he noted.
Key numbers in Jalisco state
13,435 cases (12,158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV) were reported.
This is the fourth place in Mexico in new and discovered cases of AIDS and 13 places in relation to HIV.
92% of the ban is a sexual path, 6% of the blood road and 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV virus, because in one recorded case there are four to five people who do not know about disability.
The judgment approved by the Court of Appeal of the United States, which does not recognise the restructuring of the company’s debt to the Group of Vitro established competition in Mexico, constitutes an infamous precedent for any national undertaking with its neighbours in the neighbouring country and the problem of solvency.
It appears, therefore, that the restructuring procedures for a company that enables Mexican laws, in the country of origin and stars, are not being paid in spite of international agreements.
The approval of the judgment issued on 15 June last year, Judge Harlin Halem, in the competition court for northern Texas, leaves Mexican companies in practice without defence against the possibility of confiscating their property on the other side of the river El Bravo.
However, the judgment shall open the main Mexican producer of glass to the Supreme Court of the United States with a call against three differences.
In the introduction, it should be said that while the judge of this case claims that the creditors are to be governed by the insolvency law of the United States, the appeal court of the fifth period, in New Orleans, says that the main procedure is the competitive procedure in Mexico.
Firstly, this would indicate the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of international enterprises.
For this purpose, the United Nations Model Law has been established for the purposes of combining international trade law, which is appointed by the arbitral tribunal of the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment stipulates that without voting on the part of the internal business structure, when it is recognised that the duties of the parent company of Vitro against the parties would not be met by a majority of the parties to the approval of restructuring.
However, this possibility is guaranteed by the Mexican law.
In fact, the case of Vitro was not the first to accept this scheme.
This is half the sum of examples like Agremex and Commercial Mexicoan, for which nitropods owe the Federal Competition Institute.
In addition, it is true that even after counting the votes of the side, the creditors - who stood against Vitro's company in court in the United States, i.e. the funds "groups", such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - did not reach most.
The vote would reach about 45 per cent to 37.
This information is not taken into account by a court of appeal.
On the other hand, the Vitro Court is responsible for the difficult situation that has taken place since 2008 - in the background of the serious economic crisis that has affected the United States.
In the meantime, the family company Gonzalez Sady calls for a new assessment directly to the court of appeal so that the judgement is fully attended by five judges, since the original vote was only three.
If he fails here, he will be required as the correct means of revision of the higher court process, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
In this case, it is important that the court mentioned the document sent to the Mexican government as a form of amius curiae, in which the procedure for Vitro under the Competition Law is detailed and shows that the company has made it easier to conform to the agreements signed by the two countries in order to comply with the law under Chapter 15 of the United States insolvency law.
It also shows that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, which is the rule for international insolvency cases that guarantee equality for creditors and creditors.
Look at both sides: punishment for Vitro and state companies.
Total assessment
There was no mention of a few months of notification by the Mexican Air Force Committee against former owner of Gaston Azcarrag Andradem, who was ordered from a water strike and according to the board of pilots, the damage has already occurred.
The Authority in charge of Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineaue immediately applied to the National Banking Commission and to the Commission for securities charged with the restriction of justice.
According to it, the control authority systematically refused to report to the Public Prosecutor General on the transaction carried out by this company, where the company selected 198 million pesos from the Bank of IXE from the F/589 film company.
The funds were most likely directed to the purchase of a share of the Professional Department of Hotels (Administrator of Professional de Hotels).
As we know, Azcarrag Andrade is a major shareholder of the Posadas hotel network.
Dragon Martu relief
In the area of Universidad de Caribe, a group of domestic and foreign ecologists, academics, businessmen and ordinary citizens who approved the establishment of the association were gathered on the weekend to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as we know, about a large commercial and distribution centre with products from "a country with a large wall" aimed at Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a living area for employees from 150 companies in the lower part.
In the past, the Canacintra (Camara National de la Industria de Transformación) has been able to unite the rulers of the South-East Zone to stand against the monumental area, which would partly undermine the protected area and represent the source of all industrial resistance.
End of business with ACTA document
The request for a Senate which did not take place and which requested an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican High Representative for the Trade Agreement against Share, known as the ACTA brief, was rejected by the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicoo de la Propiadad Industrial) in Japan.
As we know, it happened despite the fact that the dream itself made it possible to view it as a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketbal was my life"
The basketball champion Héctor "Hetin" Reyes had been sleeping with this salt sport for more than 60 years and was processing it all over the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have so many memories of the history of local basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was before he died in 2008 at the age of 60 in this sport, as a player of younger categories, a player of the national basketball league BSN, owner and coach of the Vacheros de Bayamón team in the national basketball league, or president of the Puerto Rican basketball Federation.
"I have had a lot of roles in my life in basketball, including several at the same time as when I was in the 1990s president of the National League of BSN, the head of the national team and the president of the federation," Reyes recalled when she visited the reporters of Primera Hora at home in Bayamón, where she has been living with Isabel, her faithful wife for over 50 years.
"The basketball was my life."
Reyes claims he doesn't.
His house, which is made of almost all photos and monuments from his long career, testifies to it.
Bayamón v heart
With the greatest excitement from all the markets, those who remember his movement in Los Vaqueros from the mid-50s, where he was a player until 1982, when he celebrated 15 years as a co-rapporteur or team owner.
"It was my best years, that I enjoyed most, because I had the opportunity with a team of Los Vaqueros since 1967 to participate in eight missions, whether as owner, partner, or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five champions from 1971 to 1975.
And then I graduated with one champion -- in 1981, when Jerome Mincy started in BSN.
Then the team took the "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," Reyes said.
"I remember that Gene Bartow, who used to be a coach here and then moved to the Alabama University in Birmingham, said to me, "I have a big two-foot player for you.
You want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players who ever had Puerto Rico.
Bartov then recommended to me the player Raymond Gaussey, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy will bring Bayamon victory to the champion, Gausse will join another."
The champion, when he played the game for the team Vaqueros Gauss, was pleased, but he was only away because in 1988 he had already performed the role of the president of the basketball Federation.
At that time, he wanted to pay full attention to his role and to enjoy Mincy's place in the national team.
"I remember our first defeat of the United States in the qualifying Olympic Games in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the world's mystery in 1990, where we ended fourth, but we had to have a bronze not to be the Canadian decision-maker who allowed us to repeat the final arrest," Reyes said.
Is gender from the world's mystery in 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one who hit the Dream Team on Olympics in 2004.
But my favorite was the national team in the Spanish games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we fired the United States men, which was quite similar to the one that fired the bronze at the world's mystery.
This man had not only Mincy, Gausseau, Ramona Rivase, Fica Lópeze and "Piculína" (Ortiz), but there were also young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, brothers Leoné (France and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be in the team in 1990 because of the injuries of the knee.
A man who may not have had perfect composition, but who showed us how to win gold medals and bring great joy, was a man from the Olympics in 1995 in the Argentine Neuquén.
With players on the tape, such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alice and Junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who rewarded players for the race in the Pan American games in Mar de Plata, we have won gold despite all the predictions.
What was Puerto Rican's best player?
It was no doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are operational.
No one in Puerto Rico has achieved this level of results such as Piculin.
He's not talking about his movement in different leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation that belongs to Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arilla from young people.
Which success in the federation do you consider to be the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous era of national men in the years 1988 to 1995 and that from the 1990s, the National League of BSNs had one season to 17 men.
What did you not prove?
There were things I wanted to take, such as the division of youth categories by regions.
For example, the Ponce boys would only play in their own areas and compete with teams from other islands only in national play-offs.
Now children travel a lot and play too many games, which is not necessary.
I also see the results in the compulsory certificates and courses for trainees, decision-makers and decision-makers.
I'm glad.
What do you owe now?
I'm listening to music, watching YouTube videos with music from my time, I enjoy learning, and sometimes I go to basketball games.
And of course I'm enjoying the company of my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
He died here, Larry Hagman.
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, played the world's leading role in John Rose Ewing, known as "J.R." in the Dallas television series, where he killed a man who ate without interest and was pleasant and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role of the Soviet rock magnet J.R. Ewinga in the Dallas television series became a symbol of the lacquer in the '80s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas series, died according to the official family notice by the Associated Press agency of Dallas Warner Bros., on Friday afternoon on a cancer-related complication.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he again played the iconic role that he had the worst," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas on Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was the representative of his wife in the original and new series, was with Hagman at the time he died in the Dallas hospital," reported her agent Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, great, fun, nice, kind and talented, and he's going to be hard on me after him.
He was unique and lived his life fully," Linda Gray said in a notice.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver surgery in 1992 and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, he was found on the railways, and Hagman was diagnosed with transplantation.
A year before the Dallas series was released, Hagman celebrated on television as an obedient guy in a distant comedy I Dream of Jeannie sent by NBC stations from 1965 to 1970.
This is where Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (gina), who plays Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedians who were sent only recently, and to The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His influence on the films included the roles that were well accepted by the critics: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was until Hangman's mysterious performance in the form of an unbelievable repugnant J.R. that led him to a star peak.
The Dramatic Series of the CBS Station on Eving's clan and other personalities around it was sent from April 1978 to May 1991.
The propaganda slogan "Who shot Jair?", which was supposed to raise expectations about the part of the full emotion when Hangman's almost killed, caused not only a huge number of speculations around the world but also the risk of millions of dollars in tax offices.
This also helped to achieve a record in monitoring.
The October 1980 part, in which the answer was found, was followed in the average of 41 million television shows. Dallas thus became the second most followed-up event in history after the release of the MASH series in 1983, which followed 50 million fans.
On J.R., his brother-in-law Kristin (who played Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant and then he threatened to sign her as a prostitute if she didn't leave town.
Hagman played Ewinga, an unsatisfied châtatic smile: an Istian businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) to become a drug addict.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the back stone," said Hagman in 1988.
It's supposed to be, "Here's the honor of J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing he didn't get out of.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, mentioned on Friday at Hagman as someone who was "great on the beach and beyond."
It is unforgettable and unfathomable for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of all of us who should have known and loved it.
Ten parts of the new Dallas series sent TNT stations a few months ago with great success.
"Five parts of the second series have been completed and the sixth has just arrived," the television station reported.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no announcement from Warner's company or from TNT station on how to proceed.
The father of Fort Worth in Texas was the son of the hero and singer Mary Martin, who grew up in classical parts, such as South Pacific music and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when, in 1931, Larry’s father, lawyer Ben Hagman, was born.
From the early 1950 ’ s, Larry experienced the happiness of the stadiums in New York, and then in the years 1952 to 1956, he served in England at the airport.
There he met a young Swedish designer named Maj Axelson, who married him.
A couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrites live.
In 2001 he published the autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Number (and Absolute Truth) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't have anything to do with what I knew would hurt or harm someone," said the agency Press Association.
After liver transplantation, he began to preach organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital where he helped fight patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the sense "Don't worry, it'll be a little unpleasant, but you'll be healthy."
He was also active in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Starts a course that examines "the end of the world"
Each week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided that this semester would make a course about the end of the world, he knew it was an inexhaustible pity: the end of the "long number" of May's calendar, which is to come on December 21, it caught many people as proof that the end of the world is coming.
Charme, however, had no idea what he was waiting for in a few months: the catastrophal hurricane Sandy, the calculated destruction that some call the “debt Armageddon”, and the growing conflict in which Israel is trapped, where, according to Christians, the theory of the end of the world begins Revelation.
"I didn't realize this would be the most exciting semester ever," said Charme this week to the students of Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey.
When a person picks up what's going on in the world today, like if we had 30 days, it's really a good time.
And remember, the bad sign for apocalyptic thinking good.
And it's not the only teacher who offers courses about "the end of the world" in this semester, which is theoretically the last in events.
At the University of Temple, the professional assistant Barry Vacker organized the course "Middles, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
"We're wondering why these ideas are spreading over time," she says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behavior.
If, for example, nuclear material is delivered into the hands of terrorists, the war can break out.
This month students are studying movies with apocalyptic topics and studying how they look at real life examples.
"I've tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible," says Vacker.
In the main campus of the National University of Pennsylvania, professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solario, a professional assistant to art and anthropology to organize a course with a simple name of the end of the world.
"We do not accept "2012," because we always count on the possibility of reorganizing the course if the world doesn't end," Restall said.
And in the face of the "hazardous ban", students must study, create projects and make final tests.
At Penn State will be a final test to finish in the pre-Apocalypse, which does not give students the opportunity to work "as soon as the expected end of the world is at night," Restall said.
The cows have become quite popular.
"He broke up in two hours," said Restall about his course for students with a high average of 35.
Weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received an e-mail asking if it was still a place.
The students themselves make sure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's coming to me to see what people are doing to please themselves," said Rutgers University of Camden, 23-year-old Bridgid Robinson, a student in the field of religion and sociology from Haddonfield in New Jersey.
And then the apocalyptic, worldly, or religious thinking is just a matter of relief or absence.
Will Weekes, a 25-year-old psychologist and hospitalist, said he saw all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of an hour in which it could be learned," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no said student, so the professor didn't say he believed in the date of the end of December 21.
"Our first project has discussed the Mayan premise and we will certainly destroy it," said Julie Zeglenová, a 21-year-old student of the last anniversary at the University of Temple of West Chester.
"Mayy's never foretold the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," said Restall.
But he added that in Western culture there is apocalyptic difficulty that takes centuries back, which people react to changes in their environment by warning of the end of the world.
The development of these speculations has caused the Internet.
"Jinde doesn't think about it," he said.
That's what's happening in most of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who spends this year in the Philippines, asked if he knew about a course of "the end of the world", he quickly answered.
"The Philippines is not involved at the end of the world," he wrote and pointed out an exception to the highest authority.
We have mercy from Pope.
Restall noted that during the last few days of the trial, he spoke about many of the last days of the court, saying that if nothing happens to December 21, "people start to think immediately about the next date" or to think that December 21 is the beginning of the seven-year period at which the world will end.
The date will be taken by students and professors.
Some said they were meant to go to "the end of the world."
"If I call a couple of friends to laugh together," explained the twenty-year-old student of Samira Ford's communication.
