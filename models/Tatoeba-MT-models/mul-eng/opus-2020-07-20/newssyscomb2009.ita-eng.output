The triumph of the right people in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceived lack of both parties in the great coalition and this significant strengthening of the right-wing right-wing populist parties led, according to the first provisional results, to the early parliamentary elections of Domenica in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), within which the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously vaccinating, has suddenly lost particularly strong.
On the contrary, the Union's electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Vice-President of Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing the triumphal return to national policy.
According to provisional results, the country's strongest party remains socio-democratic (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, compared to the 2006 elections, however, is 5.5%.
Even worse has gone for ÖVP, which loses 25.6% almost 9% of the votes.
These are the worst results of these two great parties in the Austrian history of the World War II and, above all, the literal disaster result of the peoples, which have caused early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the peoples had a great advantage in the preferences before SPÖ.
But the voters obviously punished them for making the government worse.
Already in the first responses to the results there have been speculations about the possible resignation of the president of the party, Vice-President Wilhelm Monterer.
The observers believe that Monday may already occur during the extraordinary call of the party's direction.
This evolution may have to facilitate the path to the most likely exit route from the electoral result, i.e. the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
With regard to the strengthening of both right-to-right People's Party (FPÖ), the right-to-right People's Party (FPÖ) has previously won 18% and the BZÖ 11% votes - but socio-democratic groups have at the same time revealed the concern of another 1999 when the populaceists agreed with the peoples to the collective government (the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it was separate from the European Union) which was a cause of sanctions by the European Union.
On this evolution, he obviously plays Haider, who has already said he is ready to cooperate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national policy.
In Parliament, it has also succeeded in entering the Green Party which has fallen slightly, falling between the Austrian political parties from the third to the fifth.
No other party has obviously exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can be refreshing
If the problem could not be resolved with the Czech scientists who have been accused of the illegal collection of the Scarabians in India, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, according to the Czech Minister, would have been a sort of refreshing of the Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it hadn't been resolved, then it would have been a relief," he noted after the meeting that took place under the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee after the negotiations said that executive power can hardly enter into legal cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, which has been brought to trial and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local in Dardjeeling which falls under its jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better, for Emil Kucherera sentenced to three years in prison, to appeal to a higher court.
Then you can ask for release on bail and wait for the sentence to be released.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in the same way during the negotiations.
"Recommended the appeal to the Supreme Court then it will be possible to obtain grace," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech party can enter is to provide the defendants with "competent legal support", he supported the Indian Minister.
At the same time, he said that the Indian side is already being provided with a support of the genre.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relationships they have had for many years with India.
The Indians also accept it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he said to ČTK, his partner stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We will indeed consider a serious error in the recruitment and prosecution of these blind scientists," he said.
The Minister refused to answer the question if he had obtained the promise to take care of the matter from the Indian side.
"I've got so many promises," he just found.
A Czech judge in the Battle for the Marines
It is near the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and the adjacent marine areas are designed.
But it is not interested in the continent but at a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together to the sea bottom aadian.
The area is at the same time as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 UN Division workers on ocean issues and maritime rights.
His head, the Czech Director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his exhibition and everything adds something.
He has the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The bottom of the sea still conceals a little known world of natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal minerals and other mineral materials, but also living organisms unknown to date that carry within themselves the key for the discovery of anti-cancer medicine.
The largest bottom of the teraferma
The coastal states have begun to take an interest in the southern area.
According to the OSN Convention, they benefit from laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is particularly true of the area of the so-called continental platform, which is often extended to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the state concerned.
The Convention has an exclusive right to all the resources of the continental platform.
"In a few words for the continental platform it is meant to be that part of the seabed and its subsoil that is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often more than 200 thousand nautical miles," explains Mikulka.
The request that the country submits to the Commission for the definition of the dimensions of the continental platform must be accompanied by a very broad technical and scientific documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
This is the result of preparation for many years.
"One of our tasks is to seek legal and technical assistance from the Commission.
The Commission has so far dealt with 5 requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three named have succeeded," adds Mikulka.
Australia's recent success, which has greatly expanded its marine heritage, has recorded a global environment.
But the New Zealand has also won us - the surface of the seabed, which has been assigned to it by the Commission last week, about 1.6 square kilometers so more or less than six times the same state.
Both countries have invested in the search for millions of dollars.
The profit, which will produce them in the future from the seabeds, as they promise, will be priceless.
Others will submit their requests gradually too.
They can do so for ten years since "the Montego Bay Convention" has been ratified.
This is where the continental platform begins the zone of the ocean bottom that the Convention has declared the common heritage of humanity."
No one's had an exclusive position right now.
The right to extradition in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the Marine Fund is not Clondike," said Director Mikulka, exaggerating that its individual parties are legally demarcated and their regime established contractually."
The Cechis in the Pacific
A part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
He shares it with other states of the former Soviet block in the area of the common organisation "Interoceanmetal".
This was acquired in 1991 in accordance with the Convention, as well as by investors from a few other states, the status of the so-called "Pioneer Investor".
It has the right to extract in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean extended between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and slightly larger of the former Czechoslovakia.
The background is broken, it's a nearly doubled Tatry's subatomine.
"It is possible to extract on the total surface of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich mixture of polymetallic agglomerates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker from the Division of Macedonia Rober Sandev brings with him a repertoire to show him.
It looks like a little patata or with a little fantasy, a legendary scheme, like in the legend of Golem's resurrection.
German special units were present at the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government had requested assistance from Germany for the release of the hostages – experts arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
In the context of the release of the 11 Western European hostages, more and more detailed information is available.
On the rescue operation as mentioned by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, special German units participated.
In addition to the military specialists, the GSG9 units, the federal aviation police, the federal criminal office as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution were present.
As the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Monday evening, the German units did not intervene because the sequentials, given the danger of an intervention by force, released the hostages by fleeing.
The Egyptian government has accepted the help offered by the Germans, to join them as direct on-the-spot assistance.
"We didn't come here for luck," says a spokesman from the Ministry of the Interior.
Aggressors raided on 19 September in southern Egypt a group of passengers: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts.
After the raid in a desert area in the south of Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers until the end is kept secret as well as the details of the release or possible rebate payments.
The freed in the meantime arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the freed hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
He didn't explain the details of the release.
There was no information in Berlin for when they were returned to Germany.
According to the "Build" newspaper, 5 vacations and special units should fly with an Airbus of military aircraft and arrive on Tuesday in Germany.
US representative room rejects the rescue package.
The first room of the American Congress has just failed the rescue package of $700 billion for the financial markets.
Dow Jones is down.
With 206 votes to 227, the US representative home rejected the government's rescue package for financial markets.
Despite the US President's calls by George W. Bush and first-class political parties, there was no majority for the programme, with which the chaos of the financial markets should be resolved.
In a dramatic action, the supporters desperately tried to persuade the critics of the heavy $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the Treaties, encouraged the members of the consensus, even though the plan was impotenced.
8. It is difficult to recognize to avoid something, which has not yet arrived..
While the storm was running, the Dow Jones is rocking more than 6 per cent or 600 points.
The reason for the investor concerns was that the State rescue package could have failed.
It was before the end of the vote then, after the announcement of the failure, to roll again.
Experts now expect other serious turbulence on international financial markets.
In order to ensure that the programme comes into force, it needs to have the room of the Members and the Senate.
The promoters record figures in increasing bookings
It seems that it will be a good winter for German tourist operators:
According to one study, the fact that travel bookings for the next months compared to the previous year has been significantly increased - for the winter season of more than 30%.
Despite the weak sights of conjugation, the desire to travel from Germany to an investigation remains valid.
On bookings for the winter season, the travel agencies recorded an additional 31 % of the invoice compared to the same period of the previous year , as the German Association for Tourism in Berlin learned on Monday.
According to the survey of the GfK market research institute, there are also increased booking rates for the autumn months.
Therefore, the absence of travel agencies for October compared to 2007 would be around 11%, DRW reported.
The results are expected to be the figures of the GfK, which monthly analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and sets statistical projections for the entire market.
It would also include travel bookings made by the end of August 2008.
As a result of the poor contribution of the dollar, requested in particular would be travel in the United States, he referred to the VAT.
Here the increase in reservations would amount to about one third.
It would also be necessary to travel especially to the Germans in Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as in Germany as inland areas.
Most of the trips covered have a high rate, explained the president of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the increasing costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be "better calculated for customers than for an individual organised holiday".
Consumers could save money through, among others, discounts for bookings made with strong advance or offers, including Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, as compared to the year before, there would have been a return to the invoice - even if according to further study the number of Germans who made a trip, compared to the previous year, has failed.
My first time at Octoberfest
Hits of Ballermann, beer from a litre and vip in Dirndln fluffati.
A start to the Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She's a blonde, television moderater and wears a Dirndl made of size.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is second hand.
One thing, however, tells us: just 3 minutes at Wiesn, the photographs are already launching against us and taking photos until the memory of the photography machines – very lusinghire, and this is my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how friends make themselves.
The Dirndl of two money seems to achieve its purpose.
As a tourist from Wiesn and an actual resident in the north of the white salsica equivalent, the sense of well-being in the costume/sustainment so far remains within limits.
And instead of coming to Theresienwiese, there's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears the Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks uncomfortable or uncomfortable – all perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl's grembule collects strange glances at the banana stand at the chocolate.
A monarchy makes me realize that I would have raised the grembo in a wrong way: "You're free, you're in the middle of a virgin, you're in the right, you're busy, you're in the back."
Suddenly, I'm going to get my back to the left.
All right," he says and laughs.
Others do less than flitt technical subtitlings and wear hair hats, on which the chapter "To drink to get dressed!" will be the southern nude against an unencumbered guest.
The boy with expressive incarcerations is called Bob, from England and also visited Octoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous" with a special "oooooo".
This tells me, after he was released from his beer bottle from a litre used to drink.
I'm right next to one of these irradiants, which they all think is a pattumy.
Bob is one of those family "Wildbieesler".
Others do not have the chance to break free from alcohol in this way.
On the 8th of the evening they walk white on the sidewalk of the festival the healers, who must take care of the poor bees.
Nurses are always in white – always 4 times they cross a tent-covered bar.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: it's empty, it's full.
Whoever goes under the TV in this cup of alcohol in the blood, you can't see.
"These are days, where goarnimmer packs," I cry one of the nurses and disappears in the baron.
Victim of an incident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman who died in hospitals after being invested in a vehicle while walking in Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the incident on Wednesday morning on Shenfield Road in town.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but she died shortly afterward.
After the incident a 51-year-old man was arrested with the accusation of invalidity.
It was released on bail.
Turkey is expanding diplomatic horizons
Before Turkey tried to enter the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate the Turkish continent.
On the east side of the Bosforo, perhaps 20 steps in Asia, is one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-inracial style.
This is at least what tourist guides tell you.
The building is in a qualifier between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its angles looking at the world as some German provincial municipalities.
The stone's dirty.
The whole building is slightly decadent.
But once inside the ticket office from the ceiling again, there is no doubt about the size of the company of what was the most in the West.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delay in the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East through this railway that ran to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
But the imperial ambitions of Germany fell during the first world war.
His rails will be attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arab.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has passed.
British and dominant forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there were bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a munitions train came down and destroyed its built roof.
Turkish sources say it was a satellite.
Since then it has slowly disappeared, largely overcome by history.
But today, this railway gap for Anatolia and all the east points serve - at least symbolicly - to highlight the ever larger diplomatic horizons of Turkey.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the ACP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is past.
There is now a new policy of commitment.
Notably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to appreciate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I was on the train bed for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the main experts in the AKP's foreign policy, Turkish Member Suat Kiniklioglu.
The following morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a footing race along the tracks that produced the chains from the ancient world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, they arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intended to return their backs to its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic root represents an exemplary movement in the Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspects in the West, most notablely in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the general district of the AKP, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built at hoc - in a development shelter, surrounded by commercial centers built with power supplies and pastries, where managers are fully operating - both men and women - meet to make contracts early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a policy on the right from almost every other political party in Europe.
Complete, stuck, I'm sure there was a Blackberry too.
"The purpose of the foreign political party is now to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbours.
The cold war was an anomaly," he says.
Turkey was cut out of its territory.
Today he has to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case of one or the other.
They must be both.
"But certainly at a certain point, "I ask," will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "he doesn't want to face that choice."
Then I stress a point that almost all those I have spoken to here have quoted in memory: the links not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are beneficial to Europe and the United States as much as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, Europe as a whole can metaphorically cross those railway lines to the east through Asia and the Middle East.
Again at Hydarpasha Station, after another night in white, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had seen this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised it would be to find that the medium-oriental ambitions of Europe can now be, in large part, in the hands of Turkey.
And while I look forward to the terminal for the tragedy that brings me back through the Bosfors, I remember that those days Turkey has always been called "the sick man of Europe".
At least then there seemed to be no doubt as to which continent should advance on this fascinating country.
Vite reminder: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as the music director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrology, September 11th) had the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Coro.
As a member of his municipal music scheme, the following year he founded his wonderful young choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be under-21/ under the 21s, but when Proteus sang his final in 1979, many of us were more than twenty - we simply refused to give up on the crown.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-movable) represented the good will of the heart and the ability to face all that music presented to do, whether Maryen, without accompanying or with the orchestra.
Musical versatility produced by such a young core was often amazing, always exciting, and was all due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant throughout the years.
How often Tom told us to "let it be the music to speak for himself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
There's everything there, in music.
That's why you sing it!"
His technique in the use of the jacket was absolutely clear and precise, although never dictatorial or flowers.
Whatever was the music standard, it always made it even higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you had to name a knight, an orchestra director would have been Vernon Handley.
You know him very well during the two decades that led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years and more, I have looked at more than 100 of his concerts and can honestly say that I have never been in agreement with one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal size and modesty.
He hated Orchestra leaders who, in his words, simply "were riding around the world one or two well-known combat horses".
He'll miss so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your neurology by William Woodruff (September 25, 1946) specifies that "in 1946 he was able to study economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a career in science, one in letter and one in PhD".
This comes from the note by Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but it's not right.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University, during which he completed a PhDsis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the United States as a researcher at Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he permanently left Nottingham for Illinois.
Because Woodruff has chosen to cover this part of his career, you don't know.
J. Vincent Resino to the Faculty of Philology
"Commanding José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco and life", because his photographs in white and black, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They drew my attention to the simplicity and strength they transmit, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
A show that sends a lot of feelings.
Resino can catch magical moments."
Assault for the Honda superseded
In November, Honda will start marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model had already been equipped with great housing, this new monovolume has an even larger internal space.
At all, it adds a refined mechanic, which increases the comfort of the guide and allows fuel to be saved.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz presents a very similar line to that of the previous model, the changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before going through the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz comes six years after the first generation's market entry.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in shorter times than those used by other producers.
Although the Jazz model is less known in Europe than in other markets, it remains a single phenomenon in fact of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and even during the 2008 season.
In Japan almost a million Jazz units have been sold since the launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will allow you to increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007, the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, the estimates would rise to around 100,000 cars for 2009, supporting a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, corresponding to 6.7% of Honda sales in Spain.
With regard to the new generation, the responsibility for the Spanish branch is expected to sell about 2,000 Jazz units in a year's round.
The arrival of the new Jazz itself will allow Honda to reduce sales to a great extent in Spain.
In fact, the company's responsibilities are expected to reach a total of 22,000 units sold at the end of the year, i.e. 4000 in less than in 2007, with a fall of 16%.
Despite increased sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company is expected to reach 2% in 2010.
To succeed, Honda trusts in the arrival of another model.
This is Insight, a hybrid with five gates and compact format - 4,37 meters long - from which Japanese society hopes to sell about 200,000 units per year worldwide.
For the markets and according to estimates made by the Japanese producer, 50% of the sales of Insight will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
Insight's commercial launch is scheduled for the first months of the year, immediately after the company's presentation in January in Valencia.
As for the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five cm in plus), the width of 1.69 metres (two cm in excess) and the interest of 2,50 meters, with an increase of five centimetres.
The height, however, remains unchanged at 1,52 metres.
Together with an increase in size, the interior is also expanding.
This advantage comes from the introduction of a new platform, and from the introduction of the fuel tank into central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the baggage – equipped with double background - salts at 399 litres, i.e. 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation.
It is noted that these are the engine version measures 1.4, and that the Honda Jazz 1.2 baggage capacity is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as rear leds or the possibility to mount the panoramic glass - concern an improvement in accessibility to rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions are actually opened with an 80 degrees angle, compared to 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be proposed in models with a petrol engine of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both mechanics include the VTEC technology that allows lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions, optimise mechanical and at the same time maintains the engine's pair in all its phases.
The 1.2 litre model allows use of a power of 90 cm to 6,000 wheels with a maximum of 114 Nm. to 4,900 wheels.
The explosion – which reached 78 horses in previous Jazz – uses 5.3 litres of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
With regard to the previous motion, which in the first generation model used 83 horses, they are now available 100.
The Jazz 1.4 to 100 horses achieve a combination of 5.4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "car" flag to avoid collusion
In the context of the development of crime prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired, this time by nature, and in particular by the monkeys.
Japanese society has created a robot that, for example, takes the flight of wings to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step towards the technologies for preventing collisions.
The engineers from the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Research and Technology Centre of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Two, Director-General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and the Development of Brand Management, the BR23C is an extension of the Safety Survey of four areas produced by Nissan.
This robot is designed to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the manufacturer's car.
During flight, each bird creates its own oval personal space that is very similar to Nissan's safety shelter.
But the most important thing is the eyes of the wings, able to see in all directions with a angle of more than 300 degrees, which allows the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
In order to regain this visual functionality, engineers have put in place what they have defined as a laser of location (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism identifies the obstacles facing the BR23C for a radius within two meters and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to a microprocessor on board which immediately allows to prevent collision.
"When a obstacle arises, the small robot imitates the movements of a needle and changes immediately by turning on the right angle wheels or larger to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the evasion manoeuvre is entirely essential.
"If it wasn't, the robot would not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid the obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and engineer the head of this project.
Unlike an apple, the robot cannot turn to the top or bottom, and not to the diagonal; it can move only in two dimensions and in the direction in which it can rotate its roots and not using infinite directions and methods like the apples do.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
"This device only needs to draw up the information every few seconds, and to act from these data.
It does not require the storage of information or the intuitive logic of previous manuals, so it can work without interruptions and only a couple of dozen KB memory.
This may surprise us, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, and not even mega."
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan expects will be a series of cars within ten years.
The robot uses batteries to litio polymers, which are lighter and more durable than typology with lithium ions.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of units with a GPS satellite navigation system to lead the target driver away from the obstacles in the path.
Trema before asking for a loan
We must recognize that the Department of Treasures of the United States, apart from having many capitals to intervene, is certainly not free of engineering.
Faced with the crisis and in order to prevent Americans from engaged with mutual savings in banks with doubt about insolvency, they have created a fun and educational game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Hotel of Credits"... or problems.
The teatro looks like this accommodation and, in particular, its receptionist serves to move you to think not one, but two or three times before you ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably the primary objective.
Of course the information the game provides is useful, but it's not very detailed.
It's more than a page for teenagers than a site for the wide public.
What happens when the game is complete?
Well, compare a sound room inside the hotel.
It's always something, because buying a better house doesn't even talk...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to the MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the signing of an agreement with the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a share equal to 21% of the company's participation, the news came after a net reduction of its shares in Borsa.
One week after the conclusion of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that the MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's shareholders at an individual cost of $25.25, or a sum of three billion dollars.
The price determined is less than 19 % at the accounting value of the securities until 31 August.
The MUFG will also invest six billion dollars in purchasing convertible securities at a conversion price of $31,25, ensuring a 10% yield.
Morgan Stanley stated that the overall operation would be based on an average price of 29 dollars, i.e. a percentage lower than its current rate of 28%.
By 17.00 the title Morgan Stanley, however, dropped from 6.79% to $23.07.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding company," explained John Mack, director-general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which should allow them to differentiate their actions by doing so under the control of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with the MUFG also confirms how the current financial crisis requires Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more prudent attitude than it was in the past.
The modalities defined on Monday also show that the agreement has been amended in recent days: last Monday, Morgan had just announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese Colosseum for a sum of $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of the MUFG, explained: "We thought our share of participation would be exclusively made up of ordinary actions.
But considering the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize the risks and protect us."
On the basis of the weighted average price, the MMFG will receive the securities Morgan Stanley at a price below their accounting value of 7%.
And the operation would be converted into at least 20% of the equity on a diluent basis."
The agreement provides that the MMFG may be able to convert in one year half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if, during a given period, they have been exchanged over 50% below the fixed conversion price, i.e. about $47.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by the MUFG would allow him to collect investment opportunities, strengthen his budget and increase his liquidity.
A rapporteur, however, refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following the investment of the MUFG, Morgan Stanley should therefore set up a Tier One solvency coefficient of approximately 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan needs to have "cleanly" aligned his budget from the end of August.
In the past weeks, the group has tested the value of its own actions, while the cost of insurance against risks has been very low.
However, the cost of reflowing on Monday remains at a high level, around 12%.
The week went by Goldman Sachs, another superstar among Wall Street's big investment banks after the crown of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the discovery of Merrill Lynch, announced that he had lost 15 billion dollars, partly at the Berkshire Hataway, group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa, Quito, this Monday.
Founding the Republic on a socialism right in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the last time to vote on the draft of a new Constitution.
Mission made since the official results, 64% of the voters voted "yes" to the referendum, on the basis of an 80% vote.
According to these results, "no" was 28%, while 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% were white.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, half of the votes should be cast, more than one.
On Sunday, two investigations conducted at the end of the electoral seats and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced a devastating victory of "yes", which was between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had another claim on the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his constitution project.
The "Constitution has glorifiedly trionphatized", he assured, congratulated himself with the Ecuadorians within the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The survey, carried out peacefully in accordance with the electoral observation mission of the Organization of American States (OEA), was based on a text of 444 actions to consolidate the "new socialism" defended by the president.
This draft Constitution devotes the power of the state to the economy, setting it apart from the "planification of development" of a country that lives mainly from the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently their currency.
The project, elected by Korea in 2006, also gives greater power to the Head of State, who will be elected for two consecutive mandates of four years, will have the opportunity to resign the Assembly.
Correa has already announced its intention to take advantage of this amendment and to renew its application for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also states the freedom of health and education services, which the President has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population live under the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, a provision which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
I 19 hostages released in Ciad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts ten days ago.
I'm Cairo.
The only European tourists and their eight Egyptian fellow prisoners in the desert for ten days were reported on Monday afternoon, healthy and healthy, in the capital of Egypt.
In the morning, they were released in Ciad by an Egyptian command.
Apparently, the hostages arrived at the military base of Almaza, near the international airport of Cairo, to the 15th and 30th sides of a special plane.
On the side of an helicopter, they were transferred immediately, without being able to deliver any interviews to the press, to the Maadi hospital, a residential perimeter of Cairo, to be subject to analysis.
Good "good health" and there was no "the sequestrators" discount paid, said Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna on the landing trip.
On September 19, during a 4x4 Safari on the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering with Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages was thrown away by a cover to another of 35 unknown sequétrators.
The group was composed of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and eight Egyptian leaders: two guides, four authors, a border guard and the Egyptian director, the organisation agency of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer claimed that 30 members of the special forces, on two helicopters, had launched the attack during the night, shortly before the dawn.
"There have been shots, half of the sequencors have been killed, while the others have been escaped," he said the officer who requested to maintain the anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "light" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian commands.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of secret agents and Italian special forces.
We must admit that if we have achieved this result, it has been thanks to the professionality and efficiency of the men of our secret services, special forces," he said, without adding more details.
He also stopped paying a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese Pattula army had claimed to have intercepted a vehicle 4x4 on board from which the kidnappers were found and had killed six, including the kidnappers' Chadian leader, and had two captured.
According to the army, sequentials would be linked to a rebel organization in Darfur, the movement for the liberation of the Sudan (SLA_U), a statement immediately rejected by the latter.
Letter - The silent majority of culture
On the first page, a debate on the financing of culture focuses on the current electoral campaign.
That's so much better.
But part of our cultural life is always in shadow.
Who will complain of the measures granted to small museums, archives, archeological caves or national historical places that make hunger?
What policy will be taken to thank the federal government that is going to pass home monuments and buildings?
What in Quebec, like Canada, do we not have the facts and our own laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million and a half euros for the only restoration of the castle of Chinon, in the valley of Loira?
At our American neighbors, it is the Constitution to say that the protection of heritage is part of national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, every political authority and every government department, and all of this in common agreement.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers are grouped into 211 companies for the protection of historical, genetic, archives and property, with four currencies, private archives and archaeological sites.
They are themselves who, often, defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real-time entrepreneurs and decision-makers attack with their bulldozers our forgotten remains and cemeteries.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
The governments of Benelux nationalize a part of the Fortis Bank
The states of Benelux help with partial nationalisation by the Belgian-Dutch Bank fortis, which is faced with difficulties first in Europe for the crisis in the US credit market: the three nations will provide €11.2 billion to the financial institution - insurance with interest even in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the maximum level at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Competition Commissioner.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been discussed for more than a year is that of the Fortis bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this area may constitute a precedent.
Under the decision taken on Sunday all night and three states will close to half (49%) of the bank's share in the country.
The bank will sell almost certainly part of its interests, including first of all all the assets, especially insurance, of Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week the Fortis actions had started with a vertical stop, signs of the institution's crisis were then presented in the second half of the week.
The analysts, however, agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too big to allow them to fail.
The bank's shares were almost 12%, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
In view of the current shares' prices, the total value of the group's capital is around EUR 14 billion, but according to bank leaders, this value is not real.
The company's summit led to the collapse of the Fortis shares to the uncertainty of the foreign market due to the acceptance of the US plan of $700 billion.
Monday's title slowed down.
On Friday Filip Dierckx was appointed a new delegate to the bank.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers, but no one has so far been presented with a worthy offer.
The Belgian government had already ensured that investors should not fear losing money.
Among the clients of the bank, the panic was not spread, the branches were not sealed.
In Hungary Fortis owns the autonomous branches and has also acquired leases.
The Volupe in the Pollia
In the United States, health and health insurance insurance companies, based on data from the purchase of medicinal products by people, often refuse to enter into an insurance contract.
Private experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a programme of privacy according to which the use of prescription data depends on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it's like trusting the dust to the floor" - writes Washington Post by quoting Richard Dick as the author of the program to follow the prescriptions of medicines.
Insurance companies shall subsidize the insurance fee and the expected figure in the case of fines to the health status of the relevant customer, and if they are too high, they shall not provide for insurance.
Some time ago the customer had to be subjected to a medical visit and the contract had been established only after the examination.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much more economic procedure: on the basis of the customer's identification code, you can easily get information from the medicines you bought in the last year and in the middle of the year and from this program the program covers the diseases you suffer and the health conditions you are in.
A. e. if you buy regularly large amounts of cholesterol reducers, this means that the level of fat in the blood is in practice immutablely high and is classified in the highest risk category.
There are a number of versions of the programme, some also determine the risk multiplier, so in addition to the paper work, there are few problems, although there are small difficulties.
Among the opposite is that some medicines are useful for more purposes, e.g. some compounds are usable against eczema or fever vaccines, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from the point of view of insurance - commercial, is worth the risk increase factor, the first two nos.
For the request and processing of data, companies have been formed separately and these, prior to receiving the necessary information from the pharmacist, require the patient’s approval.
Now the authorities are obliged to do so even if they have not yet affected much for the sake of negligence.
Some diets also work out the results of laboratory tests and connect them to medical consumption data in order to provide a more accurate picture of the patient’s health status.
More and more people have access to data and, at the same time, control of use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on privacy but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
Before the Congress there is a legislative proposal which gives the authorities the competence to control data-based enterprises.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: this is why he has developed a program that connects the rest of the data with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another question is that the person concerned may not so much refuse the approval because the insurance undertakings otherwise do not provide for the contract.
So finally the gallins are dependent on the clemency of the wolf.
Global Marsh menu
European Union and India doubling trade
Since the European Union and India are partners that are trading in particular, the order of the ninth day of the summit has also been dominated by this issue, as well as all other global problems.
Today there will be a French-Indian summit that will focus on the first place in nuclear energy cooperation.
The European Union recognises that India is becoming a great democratic power to which more voices should be given in international affairs, but the Member States are not yet able to decide whether to support or not New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
Therefore, this issue was not emphasized in the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as Union tour president, José Manuel Barroso, Commission President and Javier Solana, High Representative of the Foreigners, received the first Indian Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they had agreed to double in 5 years, i.e. an increase of up to 100 billion euros, trade.
In view of the fact that the trade in goods has been from 25 to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an ambitious trajectory.
As a result, the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements have been legalized, so air traffic can also take the way in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The objective is to balance because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only the ninth place between the EU's partners.
The summit drew attention to the global facts.
In the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and in terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms both parties, and called for the convening of a United Nations conference.
They called for the conclusion of the Doha Round commercial, although both parties had a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed that the energy and climate programme will continue to decrease by at least 20% by 2020 emissions of harmful substances.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the need to establish a global agreement at the conference on the climate programmed for the next year and to reduce the production of greenhouse gas by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb the increase in food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The first Indian minister today will return to the French capital where at a bilateral meeting he will prepare to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that in order to build the Indian nuclear reactors, the French people received a trade of EUR 20 billion.
According to information from our printing agency, the agreement would last 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian editors
Strong presence of Italian editors at the International Fair of the Book of Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian editors will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international appointment for the exchange of rights.
The International Fair of the book of Frankfurte awaits more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy 171,790 square metres of the Fair with more than 403 million titles in the exhibition and with Turkey as guests of honour.
It will be the Under-Secretary for the Ministry of the Interior and Cultural Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government in the opening ceremony of the Italian Padiglione: Italy will be present institutionally with an Italian Point - 264 square meters of exposed space.
The meeting will follow with the press at the Room Structure in the 5.0nd floor of the Buchmesse: this will be the opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of the building in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign authors' books gradually decreases over the total Italian production, in particular for adults and boys.
I found Steve Fossett's plane the billionaire lost a year ago
The rest of Steve Fossett's plane was discovered, the billionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying on the wilderness of Nevada.
The wheels have been reached on an altitude of 3,000 metres, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, there were no human remains.
The sheriff of the Wooder County, John Anderson, escaped the doubts that remained: "The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying the day he disappeared" said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains were found in the airport or in the surrounding area.
The billionaire, 63, was given death in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) announced that a team of inquisitors was sent a few hours after the relic was discovered, which then identified the device: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, disbanded from September 3, 2007, when Fossset decomposed from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fosset were returned by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes apartment.
It is two documents with the name of Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash in cash and a flag.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world round on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of flight alone.
Three years later, he was driving the world around by plane and without a ladder.
Among his many memories, he also flew to 15,445 meters high, above the Andes, but with a pair.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Sub out of the schematics with original design and well-defined by decided lines, wide surfaces and net angles.
This is, in essence, Glk the last born among the "compatis" offers of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a brand of news in this sector.
For its content outside the traditional cannons, it will also be unexpected and non-conventional that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at the Mercedes-Benz showroom on October 17th.
Thus, the advertising battage that will accompany the start of the new vehicle will also launch an inadvertent communication mode through an avvenitous 3D field of fittings, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi-offices, described in three different phases, will dominate the central route of the Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso How will it be possible to see the new Suv in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image will have the impression that the car goes out of the show.
Next, through the use of innovative technology Elumina8 the new Glk will be enlightened at different times in all its details, and then recovered in a single image.
Certainly Mercedes with this publication is trying to introduce something new in the stereotyped field of automobile communication.
Will it succeed in this formula to shock the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Here are Italian hooligans
Del Triveneto, they're risking Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls from which all Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group that has been following the National Azurra for years and that, in truth, there has never been too many problems.
Never had he been dealt with with hostile typhoes.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
And promoters come from Triveno.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia there are groups (a few units, in fact) from Campania and Puglia.
There are three-colored flags where the towns of origin of the soldiers are brought together: Saturday evening they were all gone to be not identified.
They're inspired by the English typhoes.
In Bulgaria they found a real Nazi typhoes, that of Levski.
The Figc had provided 144 Italian typhoes for the game: all nominees, therefore easily controlled.
And the Viminal had all controlled them: among those parties for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been inhibited by attending a stadium.
At four blue tiffos, which had previously been removed from the stadium, the ticket was rejected and the transfer was prevented.
Now the Viminale looks forward to reading the acts coming from the Bulgarian police and then taking measures: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for at least five years to the typhoes who have been arrested or to those who have been identified in the disorder.
An international summit that prevents not only Italian stadiums but throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, of course, will no longer stand in a stadium.
For luck.
But now there is fear-immunition: that is, those little more than fifty if others add it.
"We must immediately expose this fire and not legitimize who behaves in this way," they support from the Viminale.
So, "open your eyes, especially in view of the game of the National Wednesday in Lecce".
In Puglia there is actually a small nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory will meet on Tuesday the Casms can also count on a section of the Aise, i.e. secret services, which deal with problems from the stage.
"The Duke-Duce choirs and the fabric arm during Mameli's inn? In Bulgaria it's not done..."
This is the thought (expressed in a very little way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks as director of the Viminale Observatory (takes the place that was first of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlitzi).
Mazzilli in the past was this Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not possible to inject the Duke but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 typhoes has been shamed.
"I don't make the sociologist - add No.1 of the Observatory - the raids are assigned to the country in which the event takes place.
So far this group has remained in line, we will now see clearly what has happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But we are also talking about fish in the name of Mameli: neither are those that are not done, but if you allow me, they are not education ...".
