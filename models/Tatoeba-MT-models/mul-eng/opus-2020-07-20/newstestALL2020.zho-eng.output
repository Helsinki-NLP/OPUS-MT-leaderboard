On 27 days, in the struggle against women in the Netherlands, the Chinese army was forced to return to a city in the event of the victory of the two stations, finally at 3:1 Lukland, to win nine.
The World Cup is nearing its end, although the defenses are waiting, but in the face of the Serbian team, Chinese women's ranks remain unhindered.
With the two fronts of the Netherlands, the Chinese women's ranks show the same strength as the previous ones, in two cities, by 25.19,25.16, respectively, until the third stage, the team experienced a breakdown.
In the post-retirement period, women in the Netherlands were strengthened by the attack of volleyball, the Chinese team was subjected to an attack, the additional girls became more active, and the error began to increase, and eventually they returned to a city at 21:25.
The post-study report also states: " Third Chamber, because we have made a mistake, we have sent about eight minutes. "
Of course, the Dutch women's efficiency is not easy, and China's women's performance is also difficult to prepare before the race, although they lose one, but everything is still in balance, "and the force is normal, and the five are normal, so we tell the team to focus on " the team says this.
Fourth, team members are actively adjusting the situation, usually opening up all the fires in the attack, getting 8 minutes to win the team.
To date, only two rounds of the 11 matches have remained, although a Chinese woman's ranks have touched the champion's prize, but the fact is that the Chinese women's alert has been issued to China's women in the game: the more critical time it is, the more hard it is to do so.
In another 27-day match, the Russian and American women's ranks reached five levels, and the United States team failed to take full thirds from their opponents, so that China's women's ranks would only take full thirds in the match against Serbia, which would lead to a preliminary round of defense.
All kinds of situations are facing developments that are favourable to China ' s women.
However, although the Serbian forces are aware of the number of major weaknesses, this does not mean that they will be able to send three-partly to China.
From the current form of division, the Serbian troops have been essentially useless, which means that they can "plight up " in front of the Chinese women's ranks " , put the pack down to attack the opponents, and the Chinese forces are in a state of despair.
In addition, the alternate Serbian team is not the sheep of the "striking of the people" and, in the course of its work with the Dutch team, the 5th General War, the end of the three:2 of Serbia II, has turned the full lead position of the Netherlands, thereby showing the depth of its position.
Before the third phase of the race, however, the team also expressed its concern: "The big game is going to be very difficult, and we'll be ready as soon as possible."
Now there's been an explosion of defense horns, and the game actually entered the whitening phase.
In spite of its practical support, Chinese women's ranks are on the counter, but only the final key is to see if women's girls are able to play the normal level and free themselves in the race as much as possible.

However, if the hero is walking around, he looks just like you.
A study of the alpine, subtropical, subspecies, the birth of tens of millions of people under good weather, and the fall of the Huamos, was also like an old farmer in the middle of the field; a South-Easter, a Chinese top artist, a man, one-year-old, one-year-old, did just one thing, and he didn't have a cold head in the deep mountains of the country, and he didn't have anything to do with his family; a white student, an old-fashioned kid, who lived in the middle of the country, went to study with a dark white dress, and said that he liked to read at the heart, and laughed, and that he was nine-year-old film artist, and that he liked to play at the top of the top six hours of the day, and that he liked a little old girl in the "fuck"
And they are the ones who, when they are full of mercy and wisdom, stand alone and do not spend except in the way of Allah, and they do not spend it in the way of Allah, and it is easy for them to be saved from the greed and the want of riches.
As in Kim's story, the Hercules were hiding in the dark, although they were surprised by the armed forces of the world, and they didn't want to be sad.
Every "crowd of the Earth," every single baby heart, behind every one of my own family.
The family is concerned not only about the hero's hair but also about the power of millions of people.
Once, when a girl was a student, a friend of the network turned crazy, "When a hero was gone, someone always sat on the sidewalk and I didn't want to be a hero, and I wanted to be the one sitting on the sidewalk."
In fact, when he's a hero and he's a hero, he doesn't disagree.
Those who call on the street, they're sending heat and light, and they're giving themselves a light.
Like you, there's always a lot of machines in your life, there's a few moments, there's a day full of months, and it's like a hero.
At the annual meeting, the Supreme Court of the Sea, with a view to the reform of justice, gave a copy of its story to the teacher in the Chamber of Caucasians, who, without a mistake of saying, " do simple things, is not easy " , and the Chiefs of the Court of Justice will be able to appeal to this "crowded village" for a year.

For example, "China's eyes," it looks like it's a myth.
In the 1990s, Chinese technology was still in trouble in Singapore, and the novelist compassion had not yet written " III " .
At that time, the cheapest "eyes" was a single radio telescope in the Puerto Rico River in the United States â Aresbo, 350 meters straight, is considered the world's most "inexhaustible".
China's radio remote control was just one of them.
In Japan, however, the scientific conditions and wages of Japan at the world level continue to persist, bringing back a rather crazy idea: the construction of a new generation of " giant telescopes " in China, receiving more news from outer space!
China's hundreds of millions of dollars, is it a star?
Father's trust in South East, the "heavenly Eye" engineering puzzle.
The election took 12 years, and the position fell again at nine.
In 500 meters, the eye of the sky was opened, and China became an unprecedented example, " The unique scientific engineering of the world " .
So, "the eye of the sky" is amazing, the South East is awesome, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's a very far-reaching republic.

Hilak's death, political legacy survival.
On 26 days of the local time, the former President of France, Hilak, lived for 86 years.
In the midst of a century of unprecedented changes, many political heritage left by this French politician during the reign of the year is still worthy of our praise.
Hilak has served as President of France for 12 years in a very personal way.
He had inherited the independent diplomatic spirit of joyism and firmly supported the integration of Europe as a representative of the "European dream".
At the same time, he was a strong advocate of globalization and multilateralism, a politician with strategic vision.
For that reason, the French media assessed him as a " excellent representative of France at the world stage " .
One of the political decisions of Hilak was the war against the United States.
Under his leadership, France, with German hands holding the United States pressure and running before the war.
After a year of war, he predicted that the war in Iraq would increase terrorist activity and make the world more dangerous.
The following facts prove that Hilak's warning is correct.
In the fall of European integration, the United States' unilateralism has become more and more prominent, and as it has been in the past, Hirak has no doubt had a strong influence on the strategic thinking and choices of international political and global affairs.
Hilak is also one of the most famous and intimate French politicians in China.
He was one of the advocates and creators of the Central Law Relations "Golden Year", and, after the first election of the President of France in 1995, he promoted the rapid development of the Law relationship with politicians in strategic light.
In 2004, the Central Law established a comprehensive strategic partnership, with both sides entering into the new phase.
During the Hilak regime, bilateral trade between the two countries of central France grew rapidly, and cooperation in many areas, such as aviation, nuclear power and rail transport, has made significant progress.
The Year of Culture of the Hilak Initiative created a whole new model of cultural exchange in the history of Central France.
Hilak's life is particularly impressive in China's culture.
According to his Chinese diplomats, Hilak was able to turn back to White, some of the ruins of Douay, and even to judge the historical times of the Chinese potters.
"I don't see the gold medals not even really coming to Egypt, I don't see the ring really going to China" â this sentence comes from Hilhak.
Hilak once said in response to the New York Times: " Western political and social development in China, the ecological problems arising from economic growth in China and the political status of China at international level.
But I myself have full confidence in China.
I believe that China is a country with a long history of civilization, whose experience is sufficient to help it build its ideas and values for achieving and developing and to shoulder its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time. "
I also believe that China's restoration will bring new creativity to world culture and rich world culture.
Szni is gone, but Hilak remains in the political heritage of the world and reveals that he will live with the rest of the world.

The Hong Kong Regional Constitution for the Construction of Parliamentarians against the Inter-American Ports Act
On 27 days, UNAMSIL, a member of parliament, issued a statement in which he strongly opposed the adoption of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 by the United States Council of Foreign Ministers.

According to the "European Time Report" 26, the French Parliament will discuss immigration policy reform next week.
In this regard, French President McDonald said that France could not " accept everyone " , but also to strive to " receive the right " .
It is reported that Makron tried to find a road between immigration and slowing down the upcoming debate.
In recent days, Macedonia, in New York during the general debate in the United States of America, expressed the hope that there would be a genuine "double" programme in migration policy and a balance between humanitarian and efficiency.
" If France wishes to be able to receive (immigrants), it will not accept everyone " .
The four focusses on immigration policy are on the rapid deployment of asylum-related refugee protection skills; more effective promotion of immigration integration; acceptance and protection of all migrants entering France; and more effective re-establishment of illegal entry into France.
Whether illegal migrants should be protected by the National Medical Assistance System (AME) is the most important subject discussed in the previous sections.
He expressed his hope that this system would be "assessed" but not to eliminate it but to make certain restrictions on it.
After this last statement was made by Maclon, the leader of the " National Union" was rightly quoted as saying that the style of the " air " was " .
Members of the right party, Mr. Lacher, President of the Senate, also stated that immigration policy should be discussed in a "slower and "actually" manner, and criticise Cicron.
The left party parliamentarian Valo believes that France should " accept more and better" on immigration issues, and criticise the topic of Cremachron.
It was reported that the new version of the "Protection and Immigration Act" had been promulgated for a year, leading to internal discrepancies in the comments of the law enforcement parties, but it was also unable to secure the rights of the opposition parties.
In the next general election in 2022, the issue of immigration policy will again become an attack on the right side, and MakrÃ³n needs to be involved in this issue, but will also be at risk of angry left-handed people within the political party.
It was reported that the French National Parliamentary Chamber would hold a debate on immigration policy on 30 September and the Senate held a debate on 2 October.
There are signs that China's A is coming to " repurchasing " , and many companies in the city are taking out "Punnan White Bank" shares.
According to the statistics on the assets of the East Bank of the Financial Data Service, the total amount of the purchases of the company on the market in Unit A in 2019 has been over $1 billion (people currency, etc.) and over the same period of years has created a new historical high rate of the purchase of the stock of Unit A.
In this regard, the Director-General of the Management Board of the High Sea Mayco Information Board stated that this year's total market value is lower, with relatively low prices of repurchasing shares to enhance the efficiency of the use of funds by high-market companies, as well as an indication of the willingness of market-based companies to manage their market values and the full flow of cash, which is conducive to boosting investors' confidence.
In addition, an ongoing improved system for the acquisition of shares has also led to positive acquisition of shares by companies on the market.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the rules for the repurchasing of capital companies issued by the Overseas Banks and deep-sea stock exchanges provided detailed rules and guidelines for the acquisition of shares.
In addition, media statistics show that, since this year, high-market companies that have promoted a return plan have been implemented focusing mainly on infrastructure, land industry, information technology and electronic equipment manufacturing.
In addition, from the amount of resale payments, there are six companies in the market this year worth over $100 million.
Of these, the first was Eli's share, with the return of $50 million.
What impact will the market have on the market on the market in the purchase stock of the up-to-market company?
In accepting an interview of new social journalists, the Deputy Chief of the Financial Institute of the People ' s University of China, the Deputy Chief of the Financial Institute of China, said that the acquisition was a demonstration of a stronger economic and better financial situation for companies in the city, able to maintain the price stability and confidence of investors, and also of the consideration of market participants and investors.
The former were established in good business performance of the company, and the latter demanded higher quality of the company and its control unit.
For the capital market, these are the core elements.
The acquisition of shares in the market is conducive to boosting investors' confidence and making a contribution to the price of shares in the market.
It is also estimated that, according to the estimated total purchases of shares on the market company of Unit A since the beginning of this year, and that the resale of shares has been delivered at a cost of $15 billion this year, the increase in the amount of the resales from the stock market to the stock A is expected to exceed $15 billion this year.
In the near two months, the National Centre for Textual Security will be reopened during this year's season, at the end of the 26th anniversary of the restoration of the Great Wall of the Sun.
The "Sacrament of the Heavens" is a large traditional wall that reflects the mother's balance.
With the approval of the national sector concerned, it was formed by the mayor of the Ancient city Museum of Customs (the Sunset Tower) from 1991 to 1994.
It is understood that this wall is painted in the south-west of the temple, on the northern wall, 32 meters long, 2.6 meters high, and in the following two sections, with the fall of the sun, the crossing of the sea, and the rest of the 30 stories, such as the rise of the sky, and the birth of the mother again.
In recent years, it has been said that the spring rains and winter rains, which "a drop of ice" have resulted in the collapse of wall paintings, part of which is 60 per cent of the entire wall surface.
In order to protect and rescue Mother's tomb paintings, the Ancient Cultural Parks and the Sunset Towers in southern Saizon City launched a reconstruction project for the House of Lords and the House of Commons.
The repair project was organized by the Grand Duchess and invited four prominent artists to participate together.
The restoration work was based on the principle of 'adjustment as old', while the original design of the wall was adjusted to the content of the department, and additional repairs were made to the site where the wall was not really perfect.
In rehabilitating, we have also done innovation and experimentation in color, materials, ink.
After rehabilitating, the original walled wind, spirit, spirit, and artistic style were maintained.

How cool is it as a new door?
Beijing's largest international airport between the Great Lakes of Beijing and the Great Lakes of the North Province, with a distance of 46 km from the sun-to-day gate, is now the largest global building site.

This coordinated development with Beijing's international airport, suitable competition, which has an international level of competition, has reduced the volume and operational pressure of the capital airport, and can better meet the urgent need for rapid development of air transport in Beijing and around the region and effectively enhance international competitiveness in our civil aviation.
In order to ensure efficiency and quality, Beijing's international airport has given full consideration to its geographical location, its relationship with the surrounding airspace and the operating environment, its initial use of the "all-type" platform in the country, the world's largest air automation system, and the establishment of China's largest terminal control area, which is at the highest level of aviation efficiency.
The size of the airport in the country was the first to use national-produced network automatic handling and information management systems, using innovative network transport models, and to improve the efficiency of delivery systems.
Beijing is the leader of the international airport, and it is predicted that it will take a long time to fly.
This created 40 remaining international, and firstly, the country's production rate reached over 98 per cent of the new airport, which will generate direct and indirect economic impacts on the industry in the surrounding areas and contribute to the air-flow of the Beijing economy.

The East-East-East-East-East-West World Council to remember the King's Basin â the Red Cross of the Rich People's New Network.
King Bing, the East-East Lightman, born in February 1943, participated in the work of 1967 and later served as the City Party Registry, the City Registry, and the Mayor.
In 1986, King Ben served as the county of Shantok, where the city was then a poor poor town.
During the five years of the occupation of the sun, the King's heart was touched by the people, and the central forces did three things: one for the promotion of food production; two for the development of the north of the temple; and three for the building of the industrial revolution, which encouraged the lighthouses to lift their pockets from there.
There is a tradition of food and lessons for farmers to learn from.
In the early 1980 â s, there was no sale of wheat harvests, which could not be sold in the land.
It's the key to getting food.
The market was first created by the lightning rate and opened up the premise for the development of the market economy.
The party team's gonna take the lead, it's fucked up, it's all in the city.
In 1989, 17 parties, including the three village Royalty, gathered 17 winter meals, with the support of the King's House, and the year the village was set up with 17 " 2 000 " soldiers " .
In the next village, a distribution group was established, and under the inspiration of the Queen's House, the Kingdom was guided by a tour of various towns; the first year, more than 5,000 meals were distributed, and the next year it was the same as the origins of the country.
For thousands of years, 1600,000 land mines in the north have been removed from the coast, which is the coastal plain.
It's hard for the local people to live.
There's a lot of food, right?
King David's organization took tens of millions of people to the General Assembly, and settled in the desert, and it took forty-five days.
The leadership department in the Kingstown and the villages is eating on the ground, pushing cars like the civilian workers, cooking rooms, the old people see them with their big fingers and their eyes full of surprises... ... when the North developed 15 million bees, 200,000 bees, 600,000 bees, and "beauts" developed on the mountaintops.
In July 1986, the First Industrial Conference of the City of Zhao-Shiu was held as a district document.
During the meeting, a " Economic figures picture of the industrial sector in the 12 districts of Chihuahua City " was issued, and the total industrial value of China was valued, and the light was good, according to the fourth grade.
But if the originals are removed, the net industrial value of light is only $119 million, and the third is reduced.
The King's army of over 70 people ran into the field.
It's not coming back in one year. It's $150 million in the entire district, and 77 projects have been made.
Next year, it was organized to " take the Mission " , to the depths, the east coast and the upper sea.
I don't know. I don't know.
The President-in-Office of the Council presided over a panel of the thematics: 40 "students of business" were launched into the industrial line.
In 1991, Guangdong was appointed Vice-President of the city of Zhao-Qaoan.

Tano, Foreign Minister of CÃ´te d ' Ivoire, Ojono, Foreign Minister of Equatorial Guinea, Pandor, Foreign Minister of South Africa, and Kara, Foreign Minister of Niger, member of the Council of Africa, and Jechenavi, Foreign Minister of Tunisia, attended the meeting.
The Queen made four recommendations on strengthening cooperation between the Central Africans in the Council.
First, by unifying forces.
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, direct consequences of the challenge of the fundamental norms of international relations, the role of the United Nations, and the interests of large and small developing countries, including African countries.
In response to this challenge, the need for Central African handshake, arms and arms is strong.
In the Council, three African States spoke with a voice, and the combined volume was not just three votes, but the whole continent of Africa.
China and Africa stand together, not only by four votes, but also by moving other countries to follow up and influence and corrupt the agenda of the Council.
Since 2018, China has established a "3+1" coordination mechanism with members of the Council to make full use of this coordination mechanism.
Second, by consultation.
The Middle East has always promoted political solutions to the hotspots, as well as good traditional consultations in Africa, as well as successful experiences of African regional and subregional organizations.
Many complex problems at the Council's agenda, especially in Africa, are the root causes of colonialism, which are directly related to external factors.
We would like to use Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations to play a good role in the well-being and mediation of the United Nations.
Third, self-esteem.
African countries and peoples know the most about Africa, and Africa has the ability to solve its own problems wisely.
When addressing the hot spots of Africa, the Council should focus on listening to and respecting the will of Africa and should play a role in regional and subregional organizations and should encourage and support internal solutions from Africa.
The medium would like to strengthen coordination with the African side and to strengthen the capacity-building of African peace operations.
Fourth, based on development.
China and large African countries are developing countries, and we want to continue to put economic and social development first and support the development paths of our own choice.
The medium-sized community wishes to build a common " agenda " with the United Nations " 2063 " , the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda 2030, the African Development Strategy for a tight response to African countries ' strategies to help African countries strengthen development capacity to eliminate sources of conflict.
We would like to encourage the United Nations to increase its contribution to Africa's development.
The situation of the Congo (Gin) Ebola has been compounded, the Central has and will continue to exert full support, provide strength and human and material assistance, and would like to coordinate with African countries to mobilize greater assistance efforts, such as the United Nations, WHO, to play a good role in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Congo.

The hospital security of the injured couple and the baby immediately informed the motherâs room that four doctors and assistants were waiting to take the package and the babyâs bag to the floor.
"At that time, half of the mother was lying on her bike, under the water and blood, and a boy was next to her and tied to her shoulder."
She was asked to know that Baba was a 32-week early child, and the parents had not come to cover their children's bags in the street. The early mornings had already begun to smell white, and he had no tears, and he had no tears.
The rabbit quickly went to the nursery to treat the babyâs stomach, and quickly opened the package, and the package of treatment bags and packages in it filled the childâs stomachs with some heat and cleaned the babyâs respiratory system (such as the map), and then carried the baby to 12 new babyâs bedrooms.

The Director reminded me that when Mother was pregnant, when she was in pain, she broke up and saw red, she should be treated immediately.
If you are pregnant in the home or on the street, the mother should be at the same level as the baby, and the baby should be taken to the doctor as soon as possible.

Trudo's "man is breaking up." Can he get in touch with him?
This time, Trudo was pulled out of his head by a big hole, just a little bit out of Trudo himself.
In the near future, Canadian media linked many of the old photos of current Prime Minister Trudo, who had been dressed in black.
This is considered a manifest racial discrimination, which is rapidly leading to a massive wave in Canada.
After the incident, Trudo repeatedly apologized to the public.
The Canadians, however, are not able to buy the bill.
Trudo thinks it's moving stones to break his legs.
As stated by political commentators, such as Lealy's family, since the beginning of the " black-face movement" from the United States, Trudo and the Federal Free Party have consistently raised charges against the opposition party or the party ' s views in this regard, and several times it has been declared that " anyone who made this mistake should be immediately removed " .
Simplely, this time, Trudo was a little out of Trudo's head.
Trudo was the son of the former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudo, a young Englishman who had just launched a "political image" on his way.
He was originally a "political figure" who, following the lead of the Federal Free Party, fought a beautiful moment in the Canadian federal legislative elections in 2015 â over half of the Federal Free Party's parliaments in the Federal Chamber.
At the same time, Trudo introduced many of the political formulas of the so-called " Ecological Protection " , " economic reviving " , stressing the elimination of corruption and the " wrong winds " .
However, for five years in power, he's been beating his head in almost all of the above areas, " high-strengthening down " .
With regard to "ethnicity and gender equality", he did not address this "black face" incident, which he had previously failed to address in a series of indigenous issues, which led to the movement of indigenous peoples, which led the head of the opposition to the gate of the country during the 150th anniversary of the country's construction.
With regard to the collapse of corruption, at the beginning of the last year, Trudo was involved in the famous "Landian Spirits" event.
It was excavated that the construction company "Lanjan Spirit" in its own village had a serious breach of private dance cases, pressure on the sector and officials responsible for the inspection and demanded that the latter be " high-quality " .
In addition, Trudo, who was angry and angry with the officials of the disclosure case after the matter was over, was the President-General of Canada, as mentioned in the above-mentioned text, who was the first to reveal the case directly when the case was conducted.
Despite the fact that the case itself is a bit suspicious, it is difficult to wash.
Many observers pointed out that Trudo's 5-year-old government had collapsed, mainly because of its own "stupid" and the largest "stupid" "skin" and "skinned by "self-skin" and "skinned by the law" were more serious than the law.
Canada's most powerful Angolan-Reed civilian mediation data show that from 2015 to present support for Trudo ' s visitors ranged from 60 per cent to 30 per cent from 60 per cent to 30 per cent, and the opposition has never increased to more than 30 per cent.
Although other opposition parties and their leaders have shown the same disadvantage, even though a relatively small part of the voters who still want to vote for the Federal Free Party are still unwilling to present themselves to this Federal Prime Minister.
On 21 October, a new Canadian federal legislative election was about to begin, and would Trudo be able to replay the drama that was won five years ago?
The answer may be one word: difficult.
It has far-reaching and positive effects both from the level of competition, from the level of experience of consumers, or from the integration of regional aviation, and from the level of integration of Kisang.
On 25 September, Beijing was officially en route to the International Airport.
Newspapers from Beijing were informed that the capital airport has been in a state of superfluous and operational condition and that international air traffic will increase the capital air services capacity.
Following the sea, Beijing became a city with two airports in the second and second cities of my country, serving mainly in domestic aviation with the international airports at the top of the coastal bridge, which were similar to international aviation in the east, and the future capital airports and major airports would also provide more detailed services to serve in the domestic and international different air operations.
In the context of the operational development perspective, large-scale airport navigation is more beneficial for the capital airport.
In 2018, the number of passengers in the capital airport fell to 100 million, the capital of the country, but the operating needs of rapid growth remained apparent, especially the lack of international navigation.
In order to better serve domestic travel, differentiate needs, adapt Beijing to an increasing open-air approach to international-connected urban development, the largest international airport is located as a major international airport, and plans to meet the future of 10 million annual passengers, with an e-mail of 40 million tons.
Therefore, the location of the two airports is not complicated, and there is enough market space for different customers.
From the economic perspective, international airport traffic is evident to have a double impact, reducing the air traffic tension in Beijing, speeding passengers and freight volume growth, and creating increasing greenhouse gas emissions in the capital.
From the user's point of view, the future does not need to focus on the development of an international airport, but can also reduce a number of problems that have been caused by the traffic over-centralised, such as the increase in passenger safety, the slow change in travel speed, the indirect increase in aircraft and passengers ' time at the airport, the increased burden on the operation of the airport, and the reduction of traffic through the capital airport, as well as the improvement of the travel experience of passengers.
According to the media, the time and cost of travel to large international airports, such as the launch of a high-speed high-speed train from the South Five, can be achieved by 50 minutes of driving, with oil coming back to around 40 dollars and 15 dollars; the choice of a railway train station is limited to 20 km, 30 km, with a ticket price of $10,25,35 and three dollars; citizens can also travel from Beijing to Beijing Station for more than 20 minutes.
In general, there are a number of transport tools available to the public at large airports, and costs and time are also within a more reasonable range.
From the trendal development perspective: The location of the major airport is Kyin-Shuang, so far away from Beijing City, but it has strengthened the North, the Saizin-Shut, and made it easier for more people to go, and the economic development of the Saizin River is important to the North.
In the future, in the north of the river, Pacific passengers can enjoy more international aviation services provided by the largest international airport, which is one of the traffic plans of the largest airports.
In addition to the new airport line in Beijing City, there are a number of high-speed communications airports and surrounding areas.
In the same way as in the West Bank, Mount Fuhr, and far-reaching urban passengers can travel to the broadband white airport, as well as to the large-scale high-speed highway, in Beijing, and in the New York area, the inhabitants will also benefit from a large-scale airport and access to fast-efficiency air services.
As a result, international airports have not only increased their routes and aircraft, whether from the business level, from the consumer test level or from regional aviation integration, and from the development of the Kyung-Quinian integration level, have a far-reaching and positive impact on the long-term deployment and development of the Cuban aviation industry, not only on the development of various options for the expansion of the Beijing-wide population, but also on the promotion of the quality of the Beijing-based transport services and the promotion of the development of the Kyung-Kin integration process, and the development of trade in the surrounding areas.
As a result, in terms of the transport of large airports, we need more than just individual accounts in the economy and more comprehensive development accounts.

The Forum on Economic and Social Affairs of Viet Nam, 2019, held in the province of Secrecy
The Deputy Director of the Economic Commission for the Council of Viet Nam has made it clear that, at the beginning of this year, there are many new and continuing developments in the economic and social development of Viet Nam.
The Forum focused on the economic and social issues highlighted in the previous months of 2019 and on measures for economic and social development at the end of 2019 and 2020.
In the Forum, the representative of the House shared the impact of the 2019 Economic Development and Trade Agreement, some of the issues highlighted in the 2019 Vietnamese economy, the emphasis in the 2019 Vietnamese social culture, and four topics such as the forecast and recommendations for the 2020 Viet Nam economic development.
Representatives generally believe that global economic growth, risks and challenges have increased in the first few months of 2019.
Trade flows between large economies have further reduced global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that, despite the uncertainty of the global economy, 70 per cent of the global economies are in a state of slowing down, Viet Nam's economic development has continued to achieve many positive gains, macroeconomic stability, inflation has been effectively controlled, and the average population consumption index for the first half of 2019 has risen by 2.64 per cent and the lowest growth for the three years.
The growth of GDP in the first half of 2019 was 6.76 per cent, although below 7.05 per cent of the same period last year, the increase was still higher compared to the same level in the 2011-2017 phase.
In predicting trends in the economic development of Viet Nam in 2019-2020, the Deputy Director-General of the National Economic and Social Prediction Centre for Viet Nam stated that there was a higher growth trend in the world economy in 2019 in the context of the global economy.
It is expected that, by 2020, Viet Nam's macroeconomic economy will continue to remain fundamentally stable, that the implementation of its own trade agreements will contribute to trade development, economic structural adjustment, improved business environments, and the impact on trade motifs will result in a downward trend in Viet Nam exports.
It is therefore necessary to strengthen the monitoring of early warning mechanisms, to seek trade relief measures aimed at exports to Viet Nam, to explore opportunities for the development of new export markets, and to facilitate exports of various products, such as agricultural products.
At the same time, inflation rates will be controlled at a reasonable level, thereby promoting industrial development and supporting the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture and organic agriculture, etc.
The Chief of the Mission of China's Embassy in Cambodia's consulate, J.J., hosted the meeting on 26 June, to celebrate the establishment of the new China for the 70th anniversary.
For 70 years, New China has been actively involved in international affairs, which has contributed to improving global economic governance, promoting global development, promoting greater Chinese wisdom and China's programmes, contributing to world peace and development, as well as real interest in the economic development and welfare of Cambodia.
As the world's second largest economy, China's contribution to world economic growth exceeds 30 per cent, especially China's "one-way" initiative, and the cooperation between the provinces of China and the provinces of the region is ongoing.
He said that this year, as the 61-year construction of China, two countries had a friendly spirit of brotherhood, and cooperation between them would be a force for local economic and social development.
Disseha, governor of the province of Chongqing, highly praised the great achievements of the new China over 70 years, and congratulated the results of friendly cooperation between the two Central African countries.
Disaha expects both sides to continue to promote friendship and cooperation in the Middle East, to strengthen mutual trust and to continue to improve the standard of living of the people.
Disseha said that the friendship between the province of Zhao and the provinces of China was an interesting experience. To date, the collaboration between the 28 municipalities of China, the major cultural project "Shuko smile" and "King King" has been established, the exhibition of the Qao-Khao-Ghao-Ghai International Airport, the training of government officials in Zhao-Qao-Wao's school, the student's continuing school, rural clinics, and the reform of the city road, and the development of the white barrier of public interest projects "lighting" has become a direct beneficiary in the friendly cooperation of the Qao people.

From a concept of "in the shadow" to "in the sky" practice, data are estimated to be one of the core technologies of public service economic development, social management, within 10 years.
In the middle of the New T-shirts located in the Red Sea, there was more than one new " colleague " with the Al-Ari-Hungarians " .

According to the companyâs manager, this photo-based "generator" has studied more than 40,000 film-based films, based on background computing power, which can quickly transform the raw image into bilingual languages, which will be placed in a flat-rolled electronics category.
The company is now just a reflection of the transformation of the industry's aid industry.
The Ministry of Industry and Information has issued a " Guidelines for the Promotion of Enterprises Implementation (2018-2020) in 2018 " , submitted by 2020, with a view to a marked increase in corporate awareness and positive growth, a significant increase in the proportions and applications.
The King of the Al-Ari-Qaida has stated strongly that today the data centre's calculation of the cloud has built a bridge for the digital economy that is critical to data.
At the same time, the size of our country's industry has been increasing over the next 10 years.
In July this year, the Chinese Communications Institute published the " White Paper for Development (2019) " showed that China's cloud estimates amounted to $96.8 million in 2018, with a growth of 39.2 per cent in 2017.
In addition to becoming an industrial transition, key technologies for digital economic development have also changed urban management and social life in ignorance.
This year's "Chief of the City" is still a source of concern.
As indicated by Ariung, the capital of the city has now become a barrier to urban governance, and the application of relevant cooperation has been extended to 23 cities worldwide.
Through the head of the photo, human intelligence, the brain of the city, through its powerful computing capacity, enables the " pre-commissioned car" to be able to perform the functions of the new city management services, such as the " road design " of the journey route " .
In the field of government services, it has been easier to calculate the supply of government services to both sides, using " one lamp" for " one object " and " one for " one for " one for the office" for " one."
At present, the Al-Qaida has built a unified public data platform throughout the province through the government.
As of 11 September, the platform has covered over 57 million regular residents of the province and more than 15 million legal units in the province, collecting data from the Government of 3066,190.8 million.
The average monthly flow between the government sector in the province of Zhao has reached 12 million times, and the flow of data on the âdangerousâ is likely to mean that the population is running short.
Be careful with the bottle cup of tea!
According to the Central Company, a recent study in Canada found that a pack of bottles might release billions and even more than one million bottles of plastic, which is significantly higher than the number of microbes that is estimated to be taken for a whole year, yet there is no evidence that the consumption of plastics would constitute a threat to mankind.
Researchers at the University of Magir, Canada, reportedly found that the bottle was packed into almost hot water (95 degrees Fahrenheit), which would release some 116 million bottles of plastic and 31 million smaller nickels into the cup.
This amount is significantly higher than the number of microbes that are estimated to be taken annually.
According to the study previously published in 2019, the general population consumes at least 50,000 microbes per year and consumes the same number of microbes.
It was reported that the study was included in "Environment Science and Technology Journal", where researchers tested four different types of bottlenecks in Montenegrin Store and coffee office, opened the tea boxes, and re-opened the tea boxes after cleaning them into almost cold water for 5 minutes, and re-analyzing electronic light bulbs and light bulbs.
According to this study, they found that one cup of tea was released more than 116 billion bottles of plastic, " several levels of fats were higher than those of other foods " .
It is reported that most of the tea bags are made of natural rubber, but many of the use of natural tobacco is still in use with plastics.
Part of the cardboard boxes are no longer used for paper, and they are used for plastics, which are the subject of a test for researchers.
The plastic microbe is a small fraction of the plastic, which researchers define the size of these plastics between 100 and 5 kilograms, mainly derived from plastic waste.
Researchers have found traces of plastic particles from water, bottled water, sea and beer in the worldâs air, soil, rivers and deep seabeds.
In October 2018 researchers found plastic microchip in the sample of human consumption in several different regions of the world.
In order to test the potential toxicities of the tea packs of plastics, the Canadian research team found that they were placed in contaminated water, found that they would affect the behaviour of these fluids and that they would be exposed to the growth of the pellets.
According to WHO, no evidence has yet shown that the use of plastic microbes poses a threat to mankind.
However, WHO noted that further research was needed to fully understand how these particles were spread to the environment and what impact they had on mankind.
Researchers estimate that these cartons are due to large quantities of plastics that may be the cause of the contact of these plastics with water, even when the "food level" is increased to more than 40 degrees, it may also be possible to distinguish or extract toxic substances.
Guterres stated that the climate emergency was the greatest threat to the survival of small island States.
There, a natural disaster would violate the development results of one generation.
This has been described by Barbados, Dominica and Bahamas since this year.
About a quarter of the island developing countries live in 5 metres or less of the seabed.
Movements may seriously affect their social and lifestyles, even leading to issues of sovereignty and national identity.
At this week's climate action summit, small island countries jointly committed themselves to achieving 100 per cent of carbon and renewable energy by 2030, thereby re-directing the world towards the right direction.
Guterres said: " The climate crisis is putting a new unfair base on the old injustices.
Although small island developing countries have contributed to global warming, they have paid the highest price.
As a result of the high-income status of these countries, many countries have also fallen into the accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disasters and debt.
The world must take action, make major decisions now and make significant investments in small island developing countries. "
Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for assistance in the management of disaster risks for small island developing countries, investment in climate-adjustable infrastructure and the transition to renewable energy; and urged international institutions to help small island developing countries, in particular low-income middle-income countries.
Small island developing countries are at protection and preservation of Earthâs life line â the front line of the oceans.
The latest special report issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change this week confirms the serious consequences of the ocean ' s "responsibility of the climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, many regions may be able to experience an annual rise in some of the former century's extreme sea levels.
The report warns that if no large amount of funds are invested in the area of adaptation, some island countries are likely to become homeless.
Pollution, overcrowding and acidification have caused significant damage.
In the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living cells, and in the past 40 years, plastic contamination has increased tenfold.
The needs of industry, shipping, mining and tourism are reducing resources, including the maintenance of many island communities.
Small island countries also face high transport costs, energy and infrastructure.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets, which make them vulnerable to price fluctuations.
Some countries are also working to address the security impact of illicit trafficking in persons, arms and drugs.
Guterres said: " The problem can be solved anywhere through addressing a problem in the most challenging environment.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the " Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 " will provide us with a tool, lessons and examples that can be relied upon throughout the world. "
He stressed that small island developing countries were examples of sustainable development.
They need long-term attention and investment throughout the international community.
The Ministry of Finance of India has shown sufficient flexibility in the financial system.
On 26 September, the Minister of Finance of India, Sitarman, indicated that the current flow of the financial system was sufficient and that, under the needs of the agenda, the economic growth of India was expected to recover in the second half of the financial year of this financial year.
Sitaraman made the above statement after the meeting of representatives of institutions such as private banks, non-bank financial institutions and housing banks.
Sitaraman did not mention the specificity of these statements.
Some of the previous Indian media and overseas media have reduced the continuing slowdown in the current economy in India to the flow of non-bank financial institutions.
Sitaraman, for example, was sold by car and denied that the mobility tension was the reason for the sale of the car.
Sitaraman noted that the sales of cars were mainly affected by the periodic factors.
Sitaraman expects that India's economic growth is likely to recover in the next half-years of its consumption.
India ' s one-year purchase period will continue from September to the end of the year.
The market expects that the consumption of goods will greatly contribute to economic growth in India.

" Some over half of the over-age farmers in some jobs are estimated to be over half.
Where are you looking for young workers?
There's no way to use so many 'old's on the ground."
In recent days, a number of over-age agricultural workers (exceeding retirement years) have been plagued by the frustrations of the project contractors in the construction industry.
In recent times, the high school has been performing a flood-dispersion engineering, where there are many farmers in the classrooms, and if you keep an eye on them, you will find that there are a lot of over-age farmers.
It is not "unsatisfied " , but because "unsatisfied " has to be so" that old people who are unsatisfied with old age and health problems â whether it's money to solve their problems of age and health or to help their children â continue to work hard on these originals.
The "old" of older farmers is not as easy as we imagine.
Raising children, raising old people, teaching children, helping them to buy cars at home, helping them become house-to-house jobs, separating crops, when these farmers completed their "life mandate " , the money bags have been emptied even a lot of debt, and there is a huge lack of wealth.
Many farmers insist on " working until they do not work " so as not to slow children down " so that they can make more money for themselves.
Many of the 80 "90" and "00" new generation-based farmers are unwilling to work under difficult conditions, resulting in structural "use of crops " , which are not attractive and provide opportunities for older farmers.
Because of a lack of long-term skills, physical and labour capacity has decreased, many over-age farmers have worked hard, low-income, high-risk and low-risk jobs.
It's one day, and it's a little bit like, "I can't go back to the living conditions of over-age farmers, can't be ignored and deserted.
Improving the living conditions of over-age farmers, in addition to their " self-sustainment " , in addition to their " self-sustainment " , in the public sector, the protection of the system and the human rights of the public sector.
Some scholars have noted that over-age farmers are less likely to rely on their homes to solve problems such as their age and health, and they must break home by other means.
Reading the unique and strong sense of "individual" work of older farmers helps us to better understand the love and pain of older workers.
Seeing the background of over-age farmers, listening to their frustrations, trying to bring them back to the village to realize what they really are dependent on, the need for public sector, the market and society to share responsibilities in good interaction, and the need for greater solidarity.
Chemezov said that in the next five years, Russia will not export such a system, as " first of all, the national army will be supplied and then export production will be carried out " .
This practice is entirely in line with international practice.
The main production countries of arms and military equipment always ensure their defence needs first and then deal with export orders.
Earlier, General Yuri Grehov, Deputy Director General of the Russian Air Force, indicated that the development of the system would soon be completed.
The S-500 system is designed by the "Kincanstone-Antai" Air Protection Protection System.
This is a new generation of air defence systems that have adopted the principle of working for the destruction of ballistic and air-powered targets.
The main role of S-500 is to cut the average ballast missiles, which can be fired at less than 3500 kilometres.
In addition, according to some information, S-500 may also destroy high-speed travel missiles and aircraft, with almost all types of unmanufactured aircraft, exceeding 5-fold high-speed missiles and even located near space.
Such weapons can also be integrated into a network with other air defence systems, especially S-400 systems, which is important from a national perspective.
Serge Chemezov expressed particular concern about S-400.
He said that the system was now in great need in the world, but the Russian army needed it, including in the Arctic region.
S-400 air defence systems are in service of the Arctic Defence Mission.
According to news dated 15 September, the work of the New Isle of the North-East Air Defence Mission has been completed in the context of the conversion of the S-400 air defence missile system.
This is not Russian militaryization in the Arctic region.
The Ministry of Defence of Russia states that this is entirely a process in the transition plan to the northern strategic direction.
The North Army news agency reported: " The air-control area is significantly increased as it passes through the new S-400 air defence systems. "
It is very important that, according to the military assessment, the system was successful in its use in the Arctic and Arctic regions.
The air defence officers trained the new system and prepared for entry into the battle range.
The former equipment was S-300 space protection systems and is still a part of it.
As for the air defence system, it must have weapons capable of destroying various air targets, whether the target of high-level high-speed flights or the " fishing of the network near protected facilities " .
According to public sources, the S-400 "Triumph" system designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, high-speed targets and other air weapons is designed by the "Triumph" system.
The weapon can attack air-intensive targets within 400 kilometres of the launch and fall within 60 kilometres of the pilot target of 4.8 kilometres per second.
Russia has never forgotten it will complement the deployment of air defence forces in the Arctic region in order to ensure the territorial security of the North Sea road.
Before long, the first 12 "Tor"-M2DT" air defence systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic region, which were sufficient to form an air defence camp to strengthen the Arctic air defence system.
The Russian Ministry of Defence then indicated that the future of the Arctic Toll Force would extend to complete tourism construction.
In addition to the newly deployed S-400 remote systems on the New Isle of Korea and the Pantsir-SA short-range system in the Arctic region, these advanced air defence weapons have a strong hold on Russia's airspace.
An enemy aircraft, helicopters and unmanned missiles will be difficult to break this defense.
According to the Government of Russia, the flagships will be a platform for the manufacture of commercial goods in Russia and avoid the complex and long-term process of operating their stores.
Russian multinational companies, which are operating in the opera store, focus on sales of Russian goods in China.
Most Russians have the largest trading platform in online stores such as the Internet (Tmall), Kyoto (JD), 1688, Pinduoduo, hand-held Q (ShowQ) and Wechat, and have their own online platforms, Esungo.com and Russian retail retail shops.
The Russian Export Centre will jointly develop marketing policies and standards with Russia and elect a potential purchase-off product enterprise.
The business plan was launched by the end of this year and raised at least 10 Russian producers.
The information from the Russian Export Centre shows that China's electricity market has reached 100 million visits per month.
At the same time, exports of food to China have continued to grow stable since 2014, with over $100 million in 2018.
At the present time, the Arab Group will also launch a pilot shop within the framework of a global import strategy from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore.
According to Alex Kozhovnikov, the new store would sell goods of at least 50 million rubles in the market.
In fact, my expectations are higher and the sales of 50 million rubs are not enough.
We all know that Chinese consumers have a very positive attitude toward Russian commodities, considering our commodities as high quality and green environmental products. "
Kozhovnikov said that the competition for a strong purchase of Chinese consumers was strong and was increasing.
He said, "Our goal is to launch 500 businesses through this store in three years."
At the same time, the platform will also raise products from companies in the eastern regions of Russia.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, professor of Trade Policy Research at the University of Russia, said: " This is a political project on behalf of both sides, because the Russian export centre is a country and not a civil institution. "
"I didn't see a lot of highly competitive Russian goods on the market."
He believed that the project would probably not be really implemented, but would help strengthen relations between the two countries.
According to the newsmagazine, the President of the Russian Export Centre, Andrey Slepnev (Andrey Slepnev), during the Eastern Economic Forum, indicated that more than 170 Russian companies' product information had been published on the largest international distribution platform on Alibaba.com, whether in China or in other countries.
In addition, there is a model of cooperation with the Alibaba Group, namely the training project of experts from the University of Bombay to Russian enterprises, whose first workshop was held in July this year.
This year, the second Chinese international import exhibition at the Russian export centre will also be part of the Russian enterprise's participation in industry exhibitions and business projects.
A large exhibition will be held at the 1000-mile exhibition office, which will also serve as the organization of business projects, the signing of agreements, the presentation of meetings and the centre of talks with representatives of Central Enterprises.
About 50 applications have now been received from the Russian agricultural undertaking.
The Russian Export Centre News Service said: " We will also have to hold a business meeting in addition to the agricultural exhibition, namely, to establish a direct link between entrepreneurs " .
" This is another direction that we are trying to achieve, with the aim of supporting and ensuring a number of special meetings for the enterprise. "
In addition, the exhibition will also hold a master's class and a Russian-American food census on Russian cuisine, which will be held in the "Court of the Red Sea" and "Courts of the Sea" project.

New Times Reviews: We're definitely not moving our own way.
In response to the White Paper "New Age China and the World" published on 27 days: In 70 years, China's development has been successful, largely because of the fact that China's people have found special socialism in China that is the right way to develop its path and that it is definitely not moving.
China's way of development is the choice of history, the choice of the people.
In an environment where poverty has been scarce and widespread, a generation of witches have been asked to find the way to the rescue of the people of the country.
However, "The Constitution of the Constitution, Rehabilitation of the Constitution, Parliament, the Multiparty and the Presidential Institutions have thought, tried, and the results have not been understood."
As far as the Chinese Communist Party is concerned, there are new China, and the Chinese people are gradually detached from China's unique socialist path in practice.
The path that China has taken is the path of the happiness of the people of China, the path of the People of China's Rehabilitation, as well as the way of China's common development with the nations of the world.
It is because China is on the right path that it can do its own thing to become the world's second largest economy, to contribute to global economic growth and to continue to benefit the world through its own development.
As noted in the White Paper, this path of development in China, in accordance with China ' s circumstances and in line with the time requirements, will continue to reflect a bright future for development in advance.
The people of China knew how difficult it was to find the right path; the Chinese people were more concerned about it than about the world.
The Chinese understand the reason for the South-North-West, and understand that it is not necessarily suitable for anyone else, but only for themselves.
It was with such confidence and strategic strength that China had created a miracle for the world.
In the prehuman process of cutting, the "historic end" has been named at the same time.
Today, the success of China's unique socialist path has declared the end of the "historic end" , the collapse of China's theory , the failure of the "Socialistic failure" .
China ' s success has boosted the confidence of developing countries in achieving the rich nation ' s prosperity and has expanded the way for developing countries to modernize, providing experience and foundations for those who have hoped to accelerate development and to maintain their own independent nation and nation in line with their national circumstances.
The world is rich.
China has always respected the right of States to choose the path of development appropriate to their own country.
China will not "enter into "foreign mode" or "export" Chinese model, but will certainly not remove its ways, achieve its continued development, strengthen its political exchange with countries, and contribute to the achievement of good governance together.
In the Fair Work Commission, a manager of the Foodworks Supermarket hired a 66-year-old female employee by means of communications, as he was more willing to employ workers from the background of Asia, who was severely beaten by the boss as " embarrassing " .
The Committee said that Ms. Gail Ayton, who worked for more than 20 years at Wagga Wagga Store, had been working in a " very unfair " way of dealing with workers and perhaps violating anti-discrimination law.
Ms. Ayton told the Committee that Mr. King had taken over the store in 2016, and he "was trying to get rid of me " because she wasn't a man.
In this case, the Vice-President of the Commission, Peter Sams, conducted an Internet search to find " Mr. King's previous recruitment ads published in the Australian Employment Forums " .
In the job requirements listed in these posts, one of them says " Ms. Prefect of Asia " , the other says " Prime Minister of Asia " .
The third sentence says that he " prefers to the outsiders (so . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Mr. Wang hired Ms. Ayton in April this year through communications, which was later stated that this was due to her lack of employment and the alleged lack of cash from $5.10 to $30.
But Mr. Sams said that Mr. King's reasons for disbanding Ms. Ayton were weak and lack of evidence.
For three years, she's only been missing one course, "lost amount" for a couple of Australians.
He said that Ms. Ayton had been dismissed as " not really connected to her conduct or expression " .
He said: " In my opinion, in support of the evidence of the announcement of recruitment by Mr. King, the real motivation for the defender to hire her was that he was more willing to hire workers who had a background in Asia.
In accordance with article 772 (f) of the Fair Work Act, the conduct of the King constituted an illegal violation of the anti-discrimination law and/or the expulsion of the applicant. "
Mr. Sams said that since Mr. King had treated Ms. Ayton's "stupidness" treatment, he considered it inappropriate to resume her position.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms. Ayton, who was a temporary worker and who paid $26.
In view of the possible violation of the legislation against discrimination and labour relations, Sams indicated that he would submit his decisions and documents to the Commission in order to consider whether the conduct of the King should be transferred to other institutions in order to investigate possible violations of State or federal law.
He said that Mr. King had not given Ms. Ayton any opportunity to respond to her claim that she had been fired.
He said: " I believe that this opportunity should be taken by the defender to dismiss the applicant, Mr. King" and that it would " prove " that the employment of the applicant would be justified " .
"He's wrong, and the defendant should be totally disregarded for any treatment of natural justice given to him when he dismisses the applicant, and it's amazing that he is being rude and extremely unjust."
Mr. Sams said that, although the Foodworks was a small enterprise, " it must be made clear that any good employers would not be able to eliminate workers in the present case in a very unfair and unfair way."
He said: "This is a shameful thing, and it is very unfair."

As the world's largest developing countries, China is determined not to move its own way, concentrate its efforts on improving its own affairs, making the country more prosperous and happier, and the people more happy to enter a complex world of stability and certainty, which is itself the greatest contribution to world peace and development.
In the new era, China will continue to be determined not to remove China's unique socialist path from its path, following the guidance of the New Age.

The world's top age leader died at 108 years of age.
Anthony Mancinelli, the world's highest-age editor of the World Records of Gold, New York, has never retired from the day-to-day cycle, but she died of cancer and cancer from 19 June, if she had lived until she was 96 years old.
According to the CNN report, when Mansinelli was 8 years old, he moved to the United States to help clean the floor at a retail store and began to take a knife for guests at 12 years of age, thus reducing the economic pressure in the home.
Mansinelli was in high school at the time, but later he did not graduate.
Robert,son's son, explained that his father loved his work, and people from all over the world loved him, but his father came to health and was diagnosed with cancer this year, and he was not able to work for six weeks before the end of his life, but it was not a retirement, as he planned to return to his hair.
Robert, 82, says that after his father's death, he now had to find a new tutor, because he had been able to help his father cut his hair.
Over 10 billion dollars of new-new-new-new-new-new-new-new-new-new-new-new-new-new-new-new-new-new-new-new-new-new-new-new-resisting-response-sized companies in the year.
In order to maintain the company's price, maintain the company's image, the company's share of the purchase started over the next two years, and it hoped that the company's value would be sent to the market underestimated information, thereby stabilising the price and boosting investors' confidence.
Eastern wealth data from Choice showed that in 2017, the capital used by the market company for the recovery of the shares was $79 million, an increase of $51 billion in 2018 and that since 2019, the total amount of the purchase of the market company in Unit A has been over $10 billion, creating a new high rate of the acquisition amount of the asset in the past year and beyond the previous year.
In view of the purpose of the repurchasing, the company's repurchasing shares are similar to those of the major shareholders, but there are significant differences in the implementation of the topic, the source of funds, the purpose of the acquisition, and the right of equity.
In accepting the interview of the journalist " witness journal " , the President of the Executive Director of the Maritime Information Council stated that, in November 2018, " an opinion on supporting the acquisition of shares in the company " was more extensive, a complex process of decision-making and a revision of the issue of the existing system of unsound storage, which had begun to encourage the return of companies on the basis of the previous policy, and therefore greatly increased the frequency of the return of the shares in that year.
This year, in January of this year, the Office officially issued the " rules for the implementation of the acquisition of shares in the company " , which were issued by those policies, extended the source of the funds for the purchase of the company, appropriately simplified implementation procedures, led to improved governance arrangements and encouraged the implementation of the component or staffing plan of various types of companies on the market.
Following the comments, companies in the market carried out the operation of the acquisition of shares, with more applicable circumstances, easier the procurement process and more positive the acquisition of shares.
In relatively low-settled resupply shares, it also contributed to the efficiency of the use of the capital of the above-market companies, thereby increasing the level of profit per unit, increasing net assets gains and reducing the pressure on the company's profit indicators.
The increase in market shares is more significant than the increase in market shares, as well as an increase in market value management and cash flow.
According to the Sun, the price of the asset has been underestimated as a major factor in the acquisition of over-market companies, and the price of the company has been unable to reflect the future development prospects of the company, so that such companies are worthy of the attention of investors, but are not blind to the purpose of investment, and need to be concerned about the financial and operational situation of such companies.
A large-scale repurchasing company has demonstrated at least its confidence in development and financial strength.
The increase in the rate of the return on the market and the normalization of the return on the part of companies in unit A shows that nearly a thousand companies already have their share in the implementation of this year and that R & D companies in various industries are the key to the return of the market.
China's peace has recently revealed progress in the procurement process that the company has accumulated a total of 5759,000 units of the A unit through a central competitive transaction, representing 0.315 per cent of the company's total share of the total funds paid (excluding transaction costs), and that the repurchasing component will all be used for the staffing department's plan, including the long-term service plan adopted by the General Assembly of the Company.
The ILI shares have paid 57.92 million for shares and are recently adjusted for the purpose of the recapitalisation of the shares, and the original plan " will make the whole of the recapitalisation of shares encouraged as a later-implemented asset " more " more " a total of $183 million, of which 152 million will be used for the implementation of shares encouraged by the shares, and the remaining 3049 million will be used for the cancellation of the reclassification of capital " .
The ILI component indicated that the repurchasing of the partially recovered shares would help to further increase the level of income of each unit and effectively improve the investment returns of the shareholders of the company.
The release of the TCL Group's press release on 25 September showed that the TCL Group had a total of 3.59 per cent of its shares, totaling $16.5 million.
The TCL Board Office of the Board of Directors of the TCL reported to the "Courage Journal" reporters that the repurchasing shares would be used for the staffing unit plan, to encourage or to convert into a company that is able to convert into a stock.
The TCL Group continues to pursue established operational strategies to enhance competitiveness and sustainable health development.
Based on the maintenance of the company's trust and the interests of future investors, combined with the performance of the company's second-rate market for nearly a year, and the integrated consideration of the business and financial situation of the company, the company plans to use its own funds, funds and other ways of recovering its shares.
The former Maritime Open-ended Fund, Chief Economicist Mr. Hundron, pointed out that the operation of the market-based acquisition stock can, on the one hand, reduce the number of shares transferred to the market, increase the profits of each market-based company and make the price of the secondary market a significant advantage; and that, on the other hand, the market-based companies are willing to take the initiative to issue a cash-in-white bank, which has been significantly boosted by the market's confidence in the purchase of shares from the market.
In recent years, domestic market repurchasing has gradually increased, in particular by the performance unit, the confidence of investors in the acquisition of shares has been a very good way and worthy and encouraging practice.
In the province of Lake Leigh, the Long City Commission remembers Huangwa and the four leading engineering machinery industry groups that developed the world's top level of engineering from the sun from the engine to the brain.
In Sasha, construction of the world's leading engineering machinery complex is now the " strongest map " .
As a city in the province of the Netherlands, Sao speak this famous language, what's going on?
It's the power of the wind.
This time, four engineering engineers joined in the dialogue, each with a single hand, covered the sky, the ground, the whole area of the land: the light flying planes of the mountain wisdom, the combined mixed land transport of the interstellar, the three-responsible ground-up machinery, the construction of the railways, its "hard force" under the unique sun, the pride of the crowd.
At times, China does not have the right to speak in engineering.
In time of the move, China's enterprise "introduced "out" two-wheel drive, combined with "with" one-way" initiative, acquired, combined, built-in multiplicity such as the global engineering industry.
Three of them, three of them, the Central and Central Section, the Construction of Railways, the Engineering Engineers' Enterprises, their value, market efficiency, sales, major economic indicators, have led to the same type of enterprise.
It's a time bomb that's moving through the camera.
The Engineering Engineer " four-pound " was the leading enterprise in the global engineering engineering industry, which was the founder of the long-term engineering engineering industry.
Those who survive and live well in the lakes of global industry are the ones who speak in the heat of speech.
In earlier years, the global engineering engineering industry suffered winters, and a number of well-known international engineering engineering industries collapsed, but long-term engineering engineering companies have added " fat" to " coldness " , self-pressure, industrial transformation, changes in design to intelligence, not only in the past but also in the health of the body.
It is a political party that gives power to the Sun Moon.
Development of the priority industry requires both active enterprise and government participation.
The glory of the "all engineering machinery" for the long-term saline has been collected from the top to the bottom of the entire industry chain, has created a number of related industries, and, through the optimization of the business environment, has improved packaging services, simplified audit processes, enterprise development, manufacturing and sales costs have decreased considerably.
Good business environment, let the engineering machine build up the business.
History has led Sasha to the first stage of the creation of global engineering machinery, when I do not want it.
Whether the Government, or the enterprise, or the division of sections, including the relevant reproductive scholars, should seize opportunities, and, in a manner, set targets, sustained effort, contributing to the construction of the South-East Power.

Gandhi Sun: The sheep of the lake come to "relief."
In September, the earthquake struck the top of the ground.
In Zhao-Mai's professional community, 58-year-old Shavili added the last piece of food to the sheep's flocks and kept it on the side of the herd and looked at the white sheep's mouth.
"It's good to eat, and when the winter is full, it's good to sell money."
Shaveli said he gave the sheep "special food " every day, regularly cleaning up health, killing germs, and keeping it quiet.
Shavili has been raising more than 20 sheep, and until the cooperative company has worked, he knows how weak sheep have been in the past.
Shavili is a village in the town of Chongqing City of Guangdong in the province of Guangdong.
His left-hand side is a shepherd, but insists on traditional ways of feeding, poor quality of sheep, small amounts.
This year, under the direction of the Government, 140 poor people in the village joined the cooperative company and all started to change.
Shaveli's been raising her head all day because she's always had one thing in her heart.
The one who entered the unit was a poor house, and they all took care of the sheep for the cooperatives, and they were able to divide the red and sell it at the end of the year, but they were looking for him.
With the guidance of technical personnel, he gradually learned to prevent vaccines, mastered scientific food, and became a small number of " good practice " in the village.
Beneficiary professional cooperation is a standardized cooperative with 16 sheep and nearly 1400 sheep.
The co-operative heads of the community have said that there is a lot of doors outside the standardizing sheep.
"The sheep have to be built in a three-pronged area and have to be fitted with a replacement engine for winding up."

France's owner said the next year would reduce the tax rate of millions of euros and call for Germany to proceed.
On 26 September, the French richman LÃ©mel (Bruno Le Maire) said that France would reduce the tax by EUR 100 billion ($109 billion) next year, while Germany should follow the financial incentives of France to reshuffle the economy.
In introducing France's 2020 budget, Lemmel stated that the latest European Central Monetary Laundering Initiatives created an opportunity to increase investment for those Member States with commitment.
The European Centre was launched on 12 September to lower records and planned to reopen the purchase debt to reduce the cost of borrowing, hoping to stimulate economic recovery and increase the rate of inflation.
"The low interest rate will not bring Europe back to prosperity, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough," Lemuel said to the journalist.
"Germany needs to invest, now needs, as soon as possible, and don't wait until the situation gets worse," he adds.
He has made this appeal to Germany several times.
France has implemented over â¬100 billion this year, which has greatly boosted France's economic growth.
And the global economy has lost its momentum, and the German economy that is export-dependent is its main cause.
Lemmer noted that the tax burden on the French family would reduce the tax burden of â¬93 million next year, including the tax exemption of â¬50 million.
In addition, the corporate tax rate will decrease from 33.3 per cent to 25 per cent during the five-year period, and the corporate tax burden will be reduced by nearly â¬10 billion.

Research: A small increase in the U.S. national health nutrition index, but still has challenges - in the new network
On 27 September, a recent study by the United States of America showed that, in 16 years, the American Government had an appropriate increase in the number of healthy foods and rose from 56 to 58.
But in the case of 100, it is not worth the celebration.
The American people are still facing a " significant challenge " in their eating.
One of the authors of the study, Dr. Kung-swan of the University of Tavts, Massachusetts, said that the United States was still taking too many foods that could cause heart disease, diabetes, and hunger, all of which were the most common diseases in the United States.
This study was published on the American Medical Journal on 24 days.
The study is based on the conclusions of the U.S. Government of 1999-2016 on the health survey conducted by 4.4 million adults.
The authors wrote, " Although there is a visible improvement, there is still a significant food challenge " .
These challenges have been reported to include reducing the consumption of food in the United States, hot dogs, cattle, oil and fatty foods.
Studies have found that the daily intake of these unhealthy fats has increased from 11.5 per cent to 12 per cent, with more than 10 per cent of the recommended intake.
The biggest improvement in U.S. consumption is the reduction in sugar intake from 16 per cent to about 14 per cent, but the level of intake remains high.
Officials believe that the amount of added sugar should be less than 10 per cent in daily food.
For reasons of the reduction in sugar intake, researchers believe that the reduction in the use of sugar juices is related to the reduction in people's consumption of sugar, but the strain stresses that sugar has often been added to non-smokers, such as milk and tomatoes.
American adults have a small increase in the intake of food from fruit, vegetables, corn and other types of all kinds of forest.
However, the 2016 data showed that the consumption of these foods remains below 5% in daily food.
Despite a slight decrease in the intake of sugars, the decrease in the consumption of fruit juices has led to the introduction of low-quality hydrocarbons, however, it has been noted that they still account for 42 per cent of daily heat, many of which come from white surfaces and other refined valleys.
This study is based on a two-year individual health survey that will remind adults of the food they ate during the past 24 hours.
These health surveys have been asked twice every day since 2003.
The U.S. Food Guide, published by the Government, recommends that people use " healthy eating patterns " to reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
The Guide notes that more food should be consumed in the food chain, such as food, fruit, whole grains, low fat products, as well as can be supplied with protein seabeds, meat, meat, vegetables, seeds.
The number of people suffering from diabetes in the United States has increased almost once, and more than 7 per cent, and poverty rates have also increased over the many years in the seminar â such as 70 per cent of the adults in the United States today who are overweight or are overweight.
In addition, heart disease remains the main cause of the death of American nationals.

The President's assumption is close, and people's holiday plans are slow.
The newspaper newspaper recently launched a small survey on the "11" holiday arrangements by friends and received nearly 20 feedback shows that although the plans are different, the "tourage+ consumption" is the key word for the "11" holiday season.

This year's '11' has been completed, to go to the 'Ka' theater, to the children' theater, to visit the museum and the library at the end of the week, and to arrange for a few test courses. "
It was suggested that, theoretically, the growth of the population ' s consumption patterns was the result of the consumption of life-saving consumption to development and the exploitation of consumption, which enjoyed a relative part of the consumption of the type of services.
As our economic society continues to grow and the income levels of our country are increasing, people are increasingly focusing on the needs of the mental dimension, tourism and transport.

In a loud and horny voice, the head of the "Shutland Forest" project, the leader of the "Shutland" project, and the user's representative, took the award from the manager for the 2019 United Nations Earth Guard Award.
The 2019 Earth Guard Award was held in New York, New York, on 26 December 2019, with the award of an "Incentive and Action Award" of the "Incentive and Action Award" project, which led billions of people to participate in environmental action.

The economic " performance list " has been affected by the economic collapse of the United States of America.
The United States' second quarter economic performance list this year shows that private sector investment and exports have a profound impact on investment and exports, and the United States GDP increases significantly over the previous quarter.
The analysts noted that the uncertainty caused by trade fraud and its lack of certainty was the cause of private sector investments and exports in the second quarter.
The final modification data published by the US Department of Commerce on 26 days shows that the United States GDP is 2 per cent increase at an annual rate and is equivalent to that previously published, but is significantly lower than 3.1 per cent of a quarter.
Data show that consumption growth is a major factor in the economic growth of the United States in the second quarter of the year.

Knap believes that, under the uncertainty of policies, the United States enterprise capital expenditure is expected to remain below.
The analysis found that despite the strong contribution of consumption growth to the United States economy in the second quarter, more and more evidence showed that the uncertainty of trade and its effects had affected consumer confidence and had a negative impact on the United States consumption outlook.
The survey manager, professor of economics at Michigan University, Richard Constantine, pointed out that 38 per cent of consumers in the recent survey had a negative impact on the United States economy, which was a new high rate of half a year.
For future economic trends in the United States, analysts generally believe that the United States economy will continue to slow down.
However, experts also pointed out that the United States industry and the financial markets would have improved if trade had been slowed down.
The British Economics Institute of Economics, global economist Kevin Berchi, expects that the future United States economy will continue to slow down the pace of this year and increase to a level less than two-quarters.
Mudi's leading economic scientist, Mark Zaddy, predicted that this year the United States economic growth would be 2.3 per cent and that the next year would be further reduced to 1.6 per cent.

With population ageing, my social security funds are under pressure, and this time as national funds for the transferable bodies, most of which have sustained benefits and redundancy capacity, and are able not only to effectively complement the social security fund but also to provide basic water for the Social Security Fund.
It has been estimated that each transfer of 3.8 percentage points has capital, i.e. a percentage of the contribution of enterprises to basic old-age insurance.
The third phase, " Compulsory results " , translated, is an increase in the stability of the capital market.

The Social Security Fund, as a financial investor with capital in the country, is indeed the owner of the shareholding.
However, the Social Security Fund has a stronger capacity to operate capital as a valuable investor in the capital market.
For capital assets in the country, the Social Security Fund will participate in the holding unit to further improve the governance structure of the municipal business law, to facilitate the promotion of business operating levels and to have a positive positive impact on the upper-markets and capital markets.
At the same time, the Social Security Fund, as a benchmark for investment, has a high share of powers to increase its impact on the market and the role of "stabilizers" in the market.
In addition, the "values" found by investors to be fully operational are also useful to lead investors to rational investment and investment.

"With the force, you're so wrong, it's hard."
After the race, he said he'd been interviewed.
"We tell the team to focus on the attack, we're going to fight the adjustment, and we're going to fight against each other."
He also evaluated a common phenomenon, claiming that she was facing some difficulties in the attack, more urgent than trying to kill the ball and act as if she was trying to make it happen.

China ' s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and challenge.
(New China 70) White Paper: China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and challenge.
The White Paper notes that China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and challenge.
The White Paper says that as China's integrated national and international influence increased rapidly, some internationally concerned about China ' s " road to " strong states " , and some presented the so-called " Chinese threat " .
This has been recognized as a well-known error, a profound prejudice, a strong mental imbalance that has led to the loss of power, and a sharp distortion of self-interest.
The achievement of national prosperity, national reviving, the happiness of the people, both the dreams of the people of China and the common dreams of the peoples.
" China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and challenge. "
The White Paper notes that China is the main stabiliser and dynamic source of world economic growth, China is the largest contributor to world economic growth, China's technological innovation into the world's economic growth, and China's future economic stability and the role of energy sources is clearer.

China's economy is moving from high-quality growth to high-quality development, new industrialization, informationization, urbanization, modernization of agriculture, deep-rooted economic structure, continued improvements in industry excellence, and the growth of new economic growth.
" The study of the Mackenzie Global Research Institute believes that by 2040, China and other economies in the world would wish to create economic values of between $22 billion and $37 billion, corresponding to 15 - 26 per cent of the global economy as a whole, and the strengthening cooperation of other economies in the world and China would create enormous economic values. "
The White Paper stresses that China's economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and is deeply integrated.
Economic operations are more stable, higher quality, and the prospects for future growth in China are long-term benefits for world economic development.
China ' s economic development has been viewed as " threat " and " challenges " , trying to get China out of the global industry chain, supply chain, value chain , to " disconnect China from the world economy " , both ineffective and harmful .
The White Paper notes that there is a greater opportunity for all countries to share "Chinese Red Cross" abroad.
China is determined not to move towards a mutually beneficial open strategy, to achieve greater effort, to greater external openness, and to have the world's most potential consumer markets, and China is the most attractive investment destination, and to larger countries.
" Openness should be bilateral, mutually beneficial and not unilateral and beneficial.
The mutual benefit will last long. "
The White Paper states that China has committed itself to continuing to expand its imports, to expand market access, to improve the business environment, to strengthen intellectual property protection, and that other countries should also increase openness and take appropriate initiatives to work towards improving their business environment.
Only the parties can produce open, inclusive, universal, balanced, shared development environments, increase the growth of the common "cock" of development and form a mutually beneficial community of interests.
The White Paper notes that China provides more public products to the international community.
Including the promotion of high-quality joint " one road " , with multilateral dialogue and cooperation platforms, active participation in international and regional affairs, and active external assistance.
" China's development benefits the international community, and never forgets to provide better public products for the international community. "

But the authorities have already indicated that they intend to use force pressure.
Since the start of the military coup in 2013, Cecili, who has been appointed military chief, has expressed his objection to this dispute in Egypt that it is almost silent and that any form of protest activities will be more likely to fall into extreme danger.
The United Kingdom Security Report reported that the non-governmental organization in Cairo, Egypt ' s Centre for Economic and Social Rights, stated that there were fewer than 1900 arrests since last week's apparent explosion of demand for opposition from the Sessie River.
Around Cessie and his family were pursuing corrupt charges of corruption, resulting in thousands of people marching on street demonstrations on 20 days.
The Egyptian Ministry of the Interior's position yesterday firmly stated that any attempt to destroy national stability would be completely unsuccessful.
The city centre of Cairo has already been in close proximity to police, security vehicles and police on the streets around the Tahrir Square, in 2011 of the Revolutionary Exploitation Centre in Egypt.

Before Nafah was arrested, Hosni, who served as Chief Chief of Staff of Egypt's former army, was arrested.
Anun was arrested last year after the presidential campaign with Cecilia.
The President of the Constitutional Party, Dawad, was also imprisoned.
Analysts and politicians believe that, at the moment of increasing economic difficulties in the poor and middle-class economy, the dissident practices reflect the instability and vulnerability of the Government.
Ayman Nour, former leader of the opposition party, once pointed out: " The arrest of the people of Egypt and how terrible it is. "
" Since the economy has been plagued by a confusion and widespread political pressure, Cessie has tried to convey clear messages of importance to the leaders and politicians that could be replaced. "
Norl noted that the Government would only increase the anger of the people by adopting high-pressure legislation prior to the continued deterioration of the socio-economic situation.
Since the horrors had already been shattered, he expected more people to walk on the street.
Arid, a businessman and actor who is currently moving from Spain, was an Egyptian military construction contractor who started to broadcast a series of videos in the beginning of his month that benefited from the government's corruption and at the end of the week's release of small-scale demonstrations in different cities.
Ali said that his firm's overall contract with Amrak did not need to be passed through the legal tender process, so that it would be possible to obtain a profitable contract, stressing that the military and the family of Cessian relatives, including the first woman, Intissar Amer al-Sisi, were corrupted.
He was deeply sorry for his involvement.
Ari claims to be a clear contrast to the extreme poverty of the people of Egypt today and has not yet been paid to the Queen's temple and the Hwa Hotel in Cessica.
On Twitter, such as "Secretism " , " Cessie you're done " , " Cessied " , " next Friday " have attracted thousands of tweets and calls on the people to go on the street in a peaceful manner.

The port and shipping organizations of the province of Hormazgan, Iran, confirmed that the ship's commanders and shipowners had made a formal and written commitment, although the ship was detained, but they did not claim any claim.
Stana Bulk, Swedish ship owner of the oil cycle "The Kingdom of Stanna", also said that the ship was flying from the port of Abbas.
In addition, refinitive ship tracking data were found that the oil cycle began on 27 days and left the port of Abbas.
This was arrested by Iran this July by Stena Impero, a British flag.
The company's spokesman said that the oil round was about to leave the port of Abbas.
After a two-week Iranian oil cycle in the Gibraltar area, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard detained the name Stena Impero.
The ship was released in August.
Earlier this week, the Iranian Government had stated that all legal procedures required for the release of the âStannah Empireâ had been completed.
In Iran, however, the investigation is still under way.
Many Iranian media have also published a video of the oil cycle.
On 19 July, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Defence Forces seized a British oil round "Stanna Empire" in the Hormazi Sea, Iran, and then sent it to the port of Abbas.
Iran was pulled out of the Gibraltar Sea by "Grace One."
In addition, on 4 July, the British overseas authorities of Gibraltar, due to alleged violations of the EU sanctions against Syria, detained the "Grace I" oil rounds containing Iran's oil in the Gibraltar Sea.
A month later, on 15 August, the Gibraltar authorities declared the release of " Grace I " .

"I've always been" two major high-pressure engineering shipments.
On 26 days, from the east to the south-east Â± 1100,000 high-pressure electric power plants, the total GIL integrated high-pressure power supply was delivered.
Both of these projects, based on the high levels of the current world power generation technology in their respective areas, will contribute to a significant increase in the overall efficiency of our country's energy.
The Director-General of the National Energy Agency has wisely stated that East-South engineering is the world's largest power to transmit electricity to the world and to transport the most distant transport power.
Its transport is important for the development of New Zealand's energy base and for the protection of energy supplies in the region of the West Bank.
GIL, that's the absolute metal of gas shutting down the power line.
Sutton power plant has created the highest global electricity pressure level at the GIL project, the highest transmission capacity record, and the âinterference bi-cycle networkâ combination operation at the top power level of the WWC network.
According to the National Electronics Company, the distance from East to South-South engineering was 3324 km long.
With conventional technology, more than 15 per cent of electricity will be lost on the way, and the project has been under attack and has significantly increased to over 3,000 km.
Following the transfer of the East to the South-West Engineering, it is possible to transport 10 billion electricity every 8 hours and to help solve the problem of the elimination of new energy in New Zealand.
In accordance with the estimates, electricity will be available for more than half of the year over half of the entire year, when the line is sent alone to 600 to 850 billion.
The SOUTH GIL integrated power plant is a highly-pressive control plant that is over-extended.
If regular airway crossings are used, two huge railways of over 450 metres will need to be built on the long-distance surface, and an island of over four sized people will be built for each train.
In this regard, the National Electronics Network has been highly innovative and has developed a rapid high-pressure transfer of GIL power technology, which has been channeled from below water and has avoided the impact of goldways.
Two projects have contributed to the capacity of our country's electrical equipment to achieve new flights.
At present, the National Electronics Network has built "10 to 11 "high pressure" and "4 to 3" is being built.
The Foreign Affairs Department: our foreign debt structure continues to improve the stability of foreign debt.
"As a whole, our external debt structure continues to improve, and the stability of external debt increases. "
The National Foreign Affairs Authority, the speaker, said that the main indicators of foreign debt in my country are the overall risk of external debt, within the internationally recognized security line.
The Queen-Hungary made the above statement in response to the questionnaire of the reporters at the end of June 2019 at the time of the publication of external debt data by the Foreign Affairs Board.
Data show that as at the end of June 2019, the external debt balance of my country (including foreign currency) was $19.9 billion, an increase of $26.6 million at the end of March 2019, an increase of 1.3 per cent, mainly from the balance of debt securities.
In the second quarter of 2019, more than seven per cent of my country's total external debt was generated by the purchase of public currencies in non-residents, and the principal among non-residents was the medium-term investor, such as central banks.
At the end of June 2019, the average external debt increased by 3 per cent at the end of March 2019 and this foreign debt increased by 1 per cent at the end of March 2019.
The Queen-Hungary said that, with the integration of the People's Currency in my country in April 2019 into the Global Index of Chibuckle, international investors increased their recognition of China's debt market and continued their maintenance of the People's Bank.
"My country's international income maintains overall balance, and external debt risks can be controlled. "
On 27 days from the University of Agricultural Sciences in Hong Kong, the journalists learned that the night of drought was now effectively controlled, and that there was no major outbreaks of disasters, and the prevention work had been phased out.
In January of this year, the first time in the town of Pumma, the village of Guangdong, it was found to be an out-of-the-counter, and it was confirmed that there were 129 villages in the south, and the spread of the forest from south-west to China was a direct threat to China's food production.
The night-to-night cycle is an important agricultural pest that originated from a multi-food distance away from the Americas and the Asia-Pacific region, a major early warning of the global warning of the United Nations FAO, characterized by "Internationality, flightivity, horridity and destruction".
The pest damages milk, sugar, and more than 80 crops, which are high and can result in high production losses of 70 per cent.
It was difficult to fight, and in China, the registration of pesticides did not take place.
Since the late spring night, the University of Agricultural Sciences in Hong Kong has selected an Agricultural Research Centre, led by the Agricultural Institute of Agricultural Sciences, led by an innovative group of agricultural biodiesels and green protection teams, run a line, survey, collect samples, and conduct technical guidance and experimental samples.
UNMOVIC has initially acquired the characteristics of alpine algae, anticancer resources, the characteristics of outer environments, flight routes, drug toxicities and the effects of inter-terranean warfare.
They actively conducted green defence technology research and application, which, through cluster monitoring, the implementation of new green protection technologies such as pesticides, scientific drugs and agricultural measures, had reached over 90 per cent in the sample area, while reducing the use of chemical pesticides, protecting the protection of heavenly resources and the environment, providing technical assurances for the effective control of the occurrence and sustainable governance of droughts in the night of drought.
At present, the night-time drought has been effectively controlled by the tsunami, and it has not led to a massive earthquake and phased out of the control work.
The next step, the University of Agricultural Sciences in Hong Kong will focus on the development of a cluster of ecological mechanisms that will lead to violence, disrupting biological control and green protection technology systems.
At the same time, active international cooperation on cross-border efforts to establish a joint-focused laboratory and a joint monitoring network and sample area in order to increase monitoring and early warning capacities across the outlandish forests.

Social capital needs to be qualified for rural land operations
"Agreements on rural land-based movement management" publicly sought advice on the regulation of land-based management of social capital flows, such as business enterprises
Yesterday, the Ministry of Agriculture website published a public notification on the " rural land-based movement management approach (recast for a draft opinion) " (hereinafter referred to as " the draft opinion " ) and increased the regulation and risk prevention of the transfer of social capital to land-based land-use enterprises, such as business enterprises.
"Communication" is now open to the public.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that, in order to implement the new " rural land contract law " , further consolidate and improve the basic agricultural operating system, deepen rural land reform, implement " third-party distribution " , and reform " rural land transfer management " .
The Beijing Youth Journalist was aware of the many important changes to the "optimise" that had been published for the first time.
The revised " rural land contract law" has clarified the scope of land flow, followed by the concept of " triangular distribution " , the specialization of " land contract operating power " and " land operation law " , and a clear distinction between the transfer of land contract power, exchange and land operating power (retirement, transfer, entry unit or other means).
In this "notification" section, for the purpose of the "third-party distribution of the concept " to effectively respond to the " rural land contract law", and taking into account more differences in the transfer of land ownership and land contract rights, transfer to the parties, procedures, regulations, etc., this revision has been defined in terms of the transition to the area of land operations, including the transfer of land, including rental, entry into units, and the revision of the regulation, called " rural land contract management" as "a means of transfer of land land ownership " .
For the transfer of land contract operating rights, alternative management arrangements will be introduced.
In the context of "third-party distribution", the unit of agricultural inputs notes that the land operating rights are limited to a certain period of time.
According to the theory that, even if there was an insolvency settlement, farmers were only at risk of losing a certain period of operational power, thus providing that the contractors had not been required to return contractually and that there was a conflict with the insolvency law.
In practice, priority units, first lease units, and second-hand approaches, have emerged in practice to prevent the risk of loss of farmers.
Taking into account the more experienced theory of the priority unit in corporate law, it is recommended that it be a proactive provision to prevent the risk of loss of income.
