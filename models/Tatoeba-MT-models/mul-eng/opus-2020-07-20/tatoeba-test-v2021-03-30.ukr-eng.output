Tom was too tired to take care of himself.
Tom dropped Mary's sword.
Tom's pretty convincing, isn't he?
I'm sorry to talk to them.
He tried not to cry.
They feel.
Why didn't you tell me that?
Who told you what I did?
It's never late.
Leave me alone.
Aren't you ready for more?
Tom has no idea why Mary lied.
Tom's looking for work.
He'll be back in a few days.
Is it true that Midori plays the script very well?
Well, that explains everything.
You're a total optimist, aren't you?

All learned about these facts.
Tom's heart in you, right?
I'd like to become a famous football player.
Am I a hospice?
Tell us something.
I'm glad you're doing this.
Since I didn't get the answer, I wrote it again.
What would you like to say about this?
You think it's a trap?
People, stop killing one another.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were planning to do this.
I borrowed Tom's car.
I don't think I could spend six hours alone with you.
The furniture is almost gone.
I'm ready to go, and Tom's not.
I feel like a different person.
Whatever happens, I'll stay with you.

You must tell the truth.
You can be right.
This looks better.
He's having dinner.
You gave me a word.
I want Tom to wait.
We're here!
Is that bothering you?
What's in the box?
She'll be hot.
He was acting like a child to Mary.
Why are you so sad?
I did it just for fun.
Tom refused to say anything.
Mom sent you milk and cheese.
I've recently met someone in whom I think I can love.
Do you want to say you don't want to help us paint the style?
I won't reveal your secret to anyone.
Look at this.
I've never been to Florida.
You're too selfish.
We've been talking for years.
I'm very drunk.

Do you agree with their decision?

Did you see how he went out?
Can I talk to Mrs. Brown?
He lived in the center of London.
What was inside?
Tom said he didn't want to stay in Boston anymore.
What do you prefer - summer or winter?
Aren't you planning on doing this?
Luckily, no one's hurt.
Nobody knows who killed Tom.
It's not as hard as you think.
Why are you mad at me?
Let's go have a drink.
You need to wait.

He was alone in the toilet.
I hope you like it.
Have you ever seen Tom and Mary do that?
I haven't seen Tom for a hundred years.
She's five.
Your word and God in your ear!
Tom's coming next week.
You need to stop doing this right now.
My grandfather is talking very slowly.
You won?
She can speak English quite well.
I have to go.
Tom didn't seem too worried.
Tom says he's planning to do this.
What he did was not wrong.
Can you give me a minute?
Is there anything cool to drink?
I need to talk to them.
They're too big.
We'll give you another chance.
I could do that.
Zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

I don't remember exactly what Tom said.
Why did you come back here?
The room's burning.
Tom's capable of playing guitar, I think.
We've seen it.
Tom never breaks a promise.
The girl's untrustworthy.
I think I'm playing tennis with Tom.
I was out there.
I forgot to do what Tom asked me to do.
I really want to go to Boston.
Let's start again.
I really loved her.
Tom, in fact, came early.
I want to drink a cup of tea.
What is your father doing?
I'm a lusser.
You know my wife?
Tom began to study French.
Tom's fallen on a fruity sea.
You don't wear bad words.
Stop skating that fucking bird!
I told him everything.
I gave it three years ago.
It's probably a joke, isn't it?
Tom and I became unhappy at work.
Aren't you upset?
We've got half an egg.
Tom refused to go.
She drank coffee.
Tom repeated what Mary said.
So it was thirty when he died.
I want you to succeed.
He read a lot earlier.
What do you think happened?
Mom's locked up on the table.
Please bring me a cleaner.
Mary's patient, isn't she?
Do you think Tom is part of the problem?
Tom didn't want to go for a walk.
Tom's waiting for me on the corner.
I'll put the tops on my coffee.
I can't take this anymore.
Please don't go.
I was impressed by Tom’s honesty.
I read the letters you sent me.
Have you ever seen a DTP?
I understand you were kidding.
You want to learn to play guitars?
I didn't want to dance.
Wait, I'll pay for it.
We're sure of his success.

I just bought a little card.
I'm old for Tom.
This party is boring.
Why did you come home today?
Aren't you a musician?
Don't you want me to do something?
Tom can't change that.
Would you like Tom to do this to you?
Did you know Tom was alone?
Mary is my oldest sister.
He finally succeeded.
It's too expensive!
Ready number.
I want it now.
Tom, I want to stay with you.
I don't like making money for anyone.
We're teachers.
We're in the evacuation zone.
She fell into the lake.
You have to stop doing this.
That's a good question.

This bus is going to Minsk.
I need to find them now.
My mother likes to eat the cheese.
Nothing new.
I love her.
Would you like to have dinner with me?
I'm totally comfortable.
You wanted to say that?
You want bananas?
We need to be at work until nine.
We're all asleep.
I haven't washed my hands yet.
What?
Tom went to see Mary.
I have money.
I thought Tom understood.
Do you have a big family?
I'm a tax collector.
Tom holds his hand in his right hand.
There's a lot of coffee.
I'm glad you're okay.
Tom recognized me.
You're kidding.
Tom was following Mary on the street.
It was Tom who kissed Mary, not John.
I have other plans for you.
You see Tom?
I like to ride my bike.
The bullet found its target.
Tom ran to meet Mary.
What can I do for you?
Tom was convicted and sentenced to death.
This will be our secret.

I'm not marrying you.
Doing this will be risky.
I don't want to be punished.
I don't have a green cross at all.
I'm a terrible cold.

I doubt that Tom will ever decide to consider the possibility of going to Australia.
It depends on the context.
This is my dog.
Tom's working all day.
Does it matter?
Tom’s eyes were still not familiar with the darkness, so he saw nothing.
You can't burn in this room.
He'll come tomorrow alone.
I hate that picture.
I understood it.
Aren't you getting tired?
I'm praying.

Are you sure Tom's gonna do this?
After she finished working, she went home.
Who wants to go with me?
Tom said it wouldn't be hard to do it.
It turns out that there are many Turkish trolls on Tatobe.
Why are you lying?
Is that just the situation?
Tom may not know where Mary is.
Nothing's working.
Tom's still playing golf, right?
How could you let him do this to you?
What did you tell him?
She lives near the border.
Don't drink too much coffee.
Can You Answer?
What happened on October 20th?
I guess Tom doesn't have anything to do with this.
If you have any questions, let me know.
I'll talk to Tom.
I want to kiss you.
He was very busy all day long.
I'm sure he'll be back.
He was able to escape.
I wonder what Tom's thinking about.
Tom will bring Mary.
None of us speak French.
She saw him drinking a glass.
You have to tell the guy what you can't do.
Tom's been a little late.
Tom speaks French well.
Tom said he couldn't find anything to eat.
Today's a good day.
The fashion changes quickly.
I'm absolutely confused.
I couldn't figure out who it was.
Last year was a bad crop.
Tom, I hurt you.
I was impressed.
Please tell me where the eggs are.
Tom is a friendly boy.
He's eating now.
Eucharitic cells have a nucleus.
It's starting.
I still have the key from Tom's house.
She had been talking about her inherited experience for a long time.
They're all hungry.
You don't have to worry about it.

I couldn't see her.
Did Tom sleep well?
Tom and Mary told Johnny.
The elevator didn't work.
You're beautiful.
There's no one here except me.
Tom didn't want to do this with you.
I saw you on TV.
Mother Fadla was married to her husband.
He's got ten cows.
I like English.
You're cruel.
It looks like the lake's already here.
I saw a man coming into the room.
He's all right, he's just not stupid.
I was afraid it might happen.
Who else was at the meeting?
He's talking too fast.
Tom suggested that Mary have a good job.
Will Tom help you?
She's got a nice face.
Tom didn't want that.
This man cannot distinguish himself from the sinner.
You're a panda.
I'm not sure where my hotel is.
Which sugars do you like?
I almost forgot that it was his birthday.
What keeps you so late?
Leila accused Fadla of being in contact with other women.
Go with Tom.
I thought he'd come alone.
Tom Jackson is my boss.
He's my brother.
Aren't you going to show me where I can find a hotel?
I'm kidding.
I think I've asked a good question.
Okay, I have to make a proposal.
Lithuania is part of the European Union.
He was fined.
I taught my wife to drive.
I stopped doing this.
Who's your favorite figure?

Stop interrupting my words.

Tom will ask us to help him.
I'm from Denmark.
I love humarochos.
I'm not your slave.
Get your things.
Am I right?
I'm not going to church anymore.
My name is Henry.
Tom knows he has to keep working.
Tom didn't drive the car to Boston.
I'm still afraid to do this.
I don't want to do this alone.
Tom didn't know he had a secret client.
Tom's after Mary.
I still don't like Tom.
So we'd better stay home.
Tom seems to be hungry.
Did you know Tom?
Tom said he had a lot of friends in Boston.
The food's gone.
Tom and Mary are all right.
I can see myself in the mirror.
It would be nice to see Tom again.
Ten minutes at the bus station.
Why is Tom not planning to do this?
There's plenty to eat.
Tom is taller than me.
It's just what I didn't think about.
I was waiting.
In Washington, it's flowers now.
You know a good restaurant?
Tom was the oldest in our class.
He is three years older than she is.
What if our plan isn't working?
Here's the water.
You're always careful.
Tom didn't expect anyone.
I have to hurry to the station to get on the last train.
I don't understand, but I don't usually understand.
I've been listening to jazz all morning.
Tom used to date Mary and John.
A girl dressed in white, my name.
Tom's gone.
The doors are open about the second thirty days.
I want you to talk to Tom about his behavior.
I'm not in love with Leila.
He had only fourteen.
I'm teaching you to play chess.
Month has already arrived.
If it wasn't, I just can't accept it.
Did you find any problems?
Who's going?
Tomorrow's out.
Tom's shy enough, right?
I learned that Tom and I were having an accident.
I hope you'll be back.
Is there anything you'd like to buy?
You told me to do this.
Tom and Mary are opponents.
Tom wants me to apologize.
Try not to cry.
You've got a very close ear.
Can you do this again?
Are your children still asleep?
You have to try again.
Is Tom a Christian?
I want to see what's going on.
Tom sat in front of Mary.
I have less money than you do.
Tom lives in Boston, right?
He's an official worker.
You think Tom's gonna win, right?
You couldn't stop, please?
They went after you.
I'm waiting for your answer.
Tom was without a scarp.
The room's closed.
Of course, fellas.
Please, do it quickly.
He agreed with me.
Could you show me the way to the port?
What did you do last night?
Tom is a good doctor.
Don't you want to do this?
Tom said he needed to buy something to drink.
Tom thinks Mary is innocent.
I waited under the rain for at least ten minutes.
I wonder if Tom already told Mary that she needed to do this.
Are you using modern technology?
You've been working.
Tom's in his room.
Did you see anyone except Tom last night?
Is this a reliable list?
Don't get to the park.
Will this be a resurgence today?
I don't know what Tom promised.
Are you ready to go?
Please take off your shoes.
We need some money.
I knew it all.
Do I need to do this now?
Kate's trying to get in trouble.
No one on the Internet knows you're a cat.
The girl is so close that I can't separate them.
Tony broke it.
What's the holdup?
It was easy to answer.
Thank you for the information.
I have the right to know the truth.
I can't confirm that.
Where can I get my bag?
Tom said he was hoping Mary could win.
Children wake up.
I've had a lot of drinks.
Who else did you tell?
Tom lost his voice.
Is that your beer?
I'm sure it's not guaranteed.
I didn't see them.
Tom, we'll dance.
Give me your coat.
You have nothing.
Even a teacher may make mistakes.
We were disappointed in him.
Tom, maybe he's dead already.
I'm gay.
Why did I get so tired?
Wait till the end of my exams.
How many children do you have?
I haven't finished with Tom yet.
In Ukraine there are thousands of pastafarians.
You're very busy, aren't you?
I didn't testify.
We need kids fast.
Does anyone know the name of the deceased?
Here's the news.
Did you read this book?
You're not tall enough.
I just came from school.
I have nothing to do with this.
You like Japanese food?
I'm sorry Tom thinks so.
You look surprised.
Wow, it looks nice.
Have you ever been shot in the elevator?
The operation cannot be expected.
What time did this happen?
Do not try to do this on your own.
There were no survivors.
They've lost the DNA sample.
If I had time, I'd visit Tom.
Put it on the police.
Tom can't come.
I don't know where Tom is.
Your prophecy has come true.
Macros for jEdit are written on BeanShell.
You want to come with us to the concert?
Is that a fire machine?
Every food and drink is delicious and beneficial, but you need to know the time, place, and measure.
I think it's a good deal.
I wonder if she'll recognize me after so many years.
Sometimes I'm very proud.
I know you don't trust us.
I didn't kill anyone.
I don't think Tom's gonna be in Australia next week.
Tom had to wait.
You ate.
I haven't seen him for nearly three years.
I'm afraid I won't finish the story in time.
It's unlikely I'll be there tonight.
I don't trust you.
She's traveling around the world.
The boys are all right.
I wonder if Tom told Mary that she had to do this.
Tom said why does he need money?
You're good.
What does he look like?
I don't live in Boston anymore.
It just happened once.
There's Mount Fudy.
The human brains are intelligent.
The sanctuary has already begun.
Does your father know about that?
Tom's photogenic.
Please don't stop me for a while.
The man was trying to establish his own antenna.
They don't even know why.
Brahun!
Well, maybe you're right.
The Institute is wasting time.
Tom was talking about the sister’s wedding.
You know where Tom is?
They're very nice.
Give me something to write.
I really like Tom.
We don't have any lessons tomorrow.
I want to study the envelope.
There's an orange on the table.
Don't ever leave me with Tom.
Mary does everything she tells her to do.
It's a very good movie.
Why does no one answer?
Tom told me that, in his opinion, he had a flu.
My blood's covered.
You gave me good advice.
This bike doesn't belong to Him.
I thought you lost my watch.
I don't remember you at all.
These houses are my uncle.
I just did my job.
Tom didn't call anyone.
No one knows what will happen.
We're always waiting for something.
Thank you for your attention.
I'm not sorry.
Many youths this summer went to Hawaii.
Tom is my brother-in-law.
There are no comments at this time.
Tom, I want to stay with you.
Do not give up.
You pay for it!
You understand me?
Tom's gone mad.
Tom thinks Mary can do this?
Is that your hat?
Remember, you're a loser.
You want me to go with you?
She's white?
Love the trojan — patience and courage.
You like coconut water?
Barcelona is located in Spain.
He's very deaf.
There's only one pen left.
I wanted to see this movie with you.
I've learned to pry in five years.
Tom is afraid of losing Mary’s feelings.
Tom was trying to save Mary.
I came in time.
Where's your bag?
She got rid of the company.
She's trying this again.
They found the trails on the snow.
My friends believe that postpartanism is a joke.
Do as I say, not as I do.
Tom always has the best photos in his profile.
I sat in the taxi.
The sport is always easy for him.
Come on, I'm not surprised.
That's what you're hurting.
Tom came here about two and a half times.
The cat protected its prey.
It's not his mirror.
You can say whatever you want.
It's enough for one day.
Tom gave Mary his heart.
I don't think Tom's gonna remember me.
He speaks German.
Tom's not as busy as you are.
Why are you so tired?
You're a lot of hobbies.
I'm absolutely naked.
No one's heard anything about my country.
He became a national hero.
Tom said where did he do this?
We're learning Chinese.
How do I get on the other side?
Do we have a choice?
It's okay.
Let me see.
Tom began to realize what was going on.
Promise me you'll come.
Take off your coat.
He's running to the station every morning.
It ends with the commission.
Not here.
No one was satisfied.
I hope so.
I'm such an idiot.
I tried to sleep.
Tom's always online.
I moved here from Boston.
Tom just sent me a text message.
That's why it's somewhere in this building.
We're open tomorrow.
I didn't expect this to happen.
I think I'm starting with a beer bottle.
I asked him what his name was.
When do you want to go?
There must be some logic.
Did you work yesterday?
How did you convince Tom to help us color the hair?
Were you in Washington, D.C., U.S.A.?
Mary kept her balance.
I just got lucky.
They're very subjective.
It's a drug.
I'm wondering if Tom's hearty or not.
I need to get ready for the test.
Flights to the east.
Don't let him touch it.
Tom says he's your friend.
In Russia, television is watching viewers!
He called me.
He invited her to the concert.
How does he look suspicious?
No one could stop it.
Tom died of hunger.
All right, you're here.
I let the cat in.
I left your passport in the bus.
A ride in a child's room.
Does this animal eat people?
Are you a vegetarian?
You want to live forever?
Listen to what I have to say.
He'll be here soon.
Can't you pick me up?
I'm not pregnant.
He didn't break up.
I have a question.
It won't be enough!
Tom said that Mary may still be involved.
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with him.
The chief allowed me to leave earlier today.
What time is the end of the world?
I'll never worry.
How nice!
When I'm in a bad mood, I start singing.
I owe him nothing.
Where's your key?
It's gonna be cold enough tonight.
I won't ask Tom for help.
How much you paid to do that.
You don't have to leave.
One day we'll meet again.
You said you wouldn't do this.
It was a long flight.
Don't tell anyone.
I've got time to go.
I was upset.
Tom forced me over there.
How many people have died?
Did these guys do something to you?
Is Mike a member of a swimming pool?
Tom's doing orders.
You don't listen.
They found nothing.
Don't be mad.
I'm Antonio.
This land belongs to the royal family.
Are these feelings real?
We really want this, don't we?
Finally, he considered making her a proposal.
Tom was not surprised that Mary spoke French so well.
I know you're here.
Now you're on the third floor.
Aren't you happy to be rich?
There is no hope.
It's not mine.
What do you want, Tom?
We're almost there.
So you need to be home before 2:30.
You're going to school on a peache?
Is this Tom's girl?
Tom's just wasting time.
The molecule consists of atoms.
We realize that.
Not a long time now.
Do you have time to talk to me?
Sorry he didn't come to the meeting.
Where are you now?
Be careful with Bob, you know, he's been having a hard time lately.
Tom married a neighbor.
My head hurts.
Repeat again, please.
I'll be with you in a second.
I'm learning English.
It's a tough time, isn't it?
Come if you can.
I hate it!
You're a little late for me.
Tom, take care of you.
Tom said he was hoping Mary would do it.
Tom didn't look.
My parents just came to the corner.
I took my hand off.
This year you bought a ransom gift for Tom?
He is somehow responsible for this robbery.
My kite looks sad.
Tom and Mary only eat the fruit that grows on their own.
Tom showed his driving rights to the police.
Show me what's in your pocket.
She picked up the pieces of a broken bone.
When does it start?
Tom felt good.
What have you learned today?
I'm working on my own.
Tom's command took 96 eyes, 55 eyes were placed in the first team, how many eyes were taken in the second team?
What about me?
We're on our way home.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
I'll be back in less than five minutes.
You're going to be too high.
I'd like to order a butterboard.
Tom gave me a present.
Where's Dad?
Who else helped you?
I'd be happy to help you.
You're 18?
The dog is trying to escape.
Tom can't read.
I just bought a boat.
Tom had no idea that Mary was burning at him.
Tom's mad.
The appetca is on the street of Fresno.
Tom, your uncle, isn't he?
Are you ready to hear bad news?
I talked to them.
Lucy's already on the phone?
Looks like Tom.
You don't have to do this if you don't want to.
I was about to leave.
That's cute!
Did Tom mention any problems?
Where's Tom got to do this?
Mary wants me to be in her command.
Nobody's listening anymore.
You're brave.
You should do this yourself.
That means Tom was right.
I'll sit there.
Put him on.
Tom came to the last.
The prisoners will be released before Christmas.
Mary ate alone.
Are you sure you'll find them?
I'm having a bad temper.
Are you sure Tom's coming?
Where'd you get that key?
Can I help you, ma'am?

You know why Tom doesn't drink?
His book got me excited.
I don't believe Tom's coming back.
I measured the hats.
Tom is getting older soon.
Tom said I had a terrible look.
I had a little conversation with Tom.
"When will you come back?" "It's all gonna be okay."
Am I loud?
That's the name of Scotland.
Is there a hot-dod butterboard?
Thank you for yesterday.
Don't you see that you need your help?
I'm not a soldier.
Tom's wife told me he didn't have it at home.
I bought Tom's watch.
I didn't say anything.
Don't fight me.
That's how it's usually wears a tie.
The man who helped me was Tom.
I'm going for a ride.
My dog's name is Ken.
I was just.
When did I tell the truth?
I think Tom's a friend.
We didn't have much time.
I like to draw cards.
He's hungry.
What's the computer?
I'm not uneducated.
Did you sing yourself?
What are you doing?
Tom decided to do this.
Your medicine is ready.
I thought you were interested.
Well, every one of you, eh?
I was so excited that I couldn't sleep.
Tom's alive.
I was nervous.
Tom recently changed his job.
Tom refused to give Mary what she wanted.
Tom was upset.
She was an alien, and she was treated as an alien.
Karen went there alone.
Do I look nervous?
The girl we saw waiting for someone near Tom’s house is Mary.
Why don't you stop smoking?
We all make mistakes.
He wondered why his wife had left him.
I think I've put a lot of sugar.
Can you dig into the boxes?
I know how to do this.
Tom's here?
I don't have to cook dinner tonight.
I have something to say.
The hotel can take 300 people.
I drank Tom's pizza.
She can ask questions and answer them.
Tom said he had an alibi.
Tom has two wives.
What is Tom doing in Boston?
Tom didn't think Mary wanted to do that.
Tom and Mary said they're not sick.
I've got a lot of time.
One more, please.
I'm a member of the team.
I had a stroke last year.
Mom's busy preparing dinner.
Horses are useful animals.
Come back faster.
He's incapacitated.
Fom's been training.
He's impatient.
He's sure it's a test.
Tom voted for the proposal.
Tom told you how long it took him to do this?
Let's start!
Attention!
I'm totally exhausted.
The prospects are not too bright.
I don't believe in anything supernatural, but I'm attracted to the literature of the Devil.
I'm sorry she doesn't have enough experience.
I spent some time in Boston.
You look great.
I was a teacher.
You like English, don't you?
Tom and Mary called their son John.
I wonder if Tom's actually going to Mary's concert.
Tom said he'd been through the past exits with that?
I used to have the same problem.
I love nature.
She taught us to sing.
Let's do nothing at all.
Tom wants his father to hide behind his mother.
You think we wouldn't notice?
Your dinner was so delicious!
I just found a solution to the problem.
Tom promised me he wouldn't cry.
I'm di-jay.
I hate Christmas.
Was the crime enough?
Tom found my contact lenses.
It costs too much.
The child's gone.
I just wanted to give it to you.
I want to surprise him.
You need to learn to control yourself.
We're all right.
My girlfriend's stolen.
He knows many.
You're not young.
The same is true of Japan.
We're losing.
The situation is getting worse and worse.
Talk.
The surface of the windmill is a non-ecliptic space, so it does not comply with the rules of the ecliptic geometry.
The talks were successful.
I'm sorry about that.
Don't you want to come with us?
I was trying to call you.
I never killed anyone.
Be honest and straightforward.
Hope is always there.
I wanted to be Tom.
Tom and Mary will say no.
You're twice older than me.
The journalist was stolen by the terrorists.
I let the sword go.
I hate this city.
Now he lives in Tokyo.
The programming language is his hobby.
I'm glad to hear that.
I don't know anything about him.
Tom is a teacher, and so am I.
How many hours do you have in the house?
Tom's deaf.
So he doesn't like to eat fish.
I don't like any of them.
Follow us.
Tom's very proud of you.
Your doctor says you'll be all right.
You're a panda.
You want to know?
Tom needs to get his clothes off.
I need that money.
My scarf is a nightmare.
Tom's gonna cry?
So it would be too much to be proud.
I have to help my mom.
His book got me excited.
You're brothers?
That's not my idea.
You have a plan, don't you?
He's playing.
Tom's not in town.
I've had a stroke.
The next year will be worse.
Mary's in the ice cream.
In love of a bitter touch.
The meeting's over.
You should have done this last year.
I thought I couldn't do it.
I got an old car.
We understand why.
I eat every year.
I felt helpless.
I like a teacher.
They went to the elevator.
Tom is a professional hockeyist.
We went to the forest to search for the trees.
These chairs are different.
I saw her a week ago.
A small cup of coffee cost two euros.
Parental love is more than all else.
He was persecuted by thieves.
I worked in the restaurant.
I'm not strong enough.
It won't be as boring as you think.
He accidentally put salt in his cup of coffee.
Tom forgot to tell you.
I'm interested in music.
I really don't want to eat now.
The roofs were torn apart on the floor.
You're so weird.
The country is rich with natural resources.
I'm Tom's partner.
What a wonderful machine!
She missed school.
Tom sat by the window.
Tom is the same as the rest of them.
Tom doesn't think I have to do this.
State debt is rising.
Why am I, not you?
Tom, we'll probably never do that.
That's a bitch.
Get out of here!
Tom doesn't know where Mary is now.
We all agreed with Tom.
I'm going to act.
I read this story in a book.
Tom still got a bike?
He's talking a little bit.
Tom's smarter.
It was a tough night for him.
I want to slow down.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows someone who could do this.
I'm an interpreter.
You've had a good time, haven't you?
I was born in 1997 in Osaka.
You have a good voice.
It's important that you understand.
Tom won't do that.
I hope Tom understands.
She spends a lot of time online.
You're amazing.
Tom said he'd be late.
Let's meet him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't do this.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom's in 30 minutes.
I don't know who Tom sold his car.
We can talk.
The computer can be calculated very quickly.
You don't have to.
Excuse me, can I open the window?
What time is it?
I am thirty years old.
Tom won't worry about you anymore.
You want some more tea?
It's a Japanese lion.
What did you eat for dinner today?
You can't even change the papers.
Do people still use webcams?
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she left school.
This word is derived from Greek.
Am I going to die?
I'm dying, so I want to see them.
He's sick.
Don't worry.
The car's out.
I was weak.
Please make me a cup of coffee.
Mary lost money.
No rules.
Leila was very busy.
He's not a liar.
Do you know how to make salads from cheese?
Tom knew what Mary knew.
Tom's cooking breakfast.
There is no doubt that rain is coming.
Tom didn't mention Australia.
Apparently, Tom and Mary are more than just friends.
We actually went to Boston.
There are many volcanoes in Iceland.
John is two years older than I am.
Better or worse, but television has changed the world.
I'm a little tired.
He answered my question easily.
What is the purpose of your trip?
Tom's looking for something.
He's probably innocent.
I love children.
Who left?
When does she come?
It's not my style.
Try to focus.
I'm so glad I did it yesterday.
Is Tom still living with you?
I wanted to touch Tom.
I just want to help you.
Do not give up.
She's got a dog?
I was a magician.
Don't beat me when I'm talking.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you see him often?
Tom would like you.
Are you hungry yet?
We're crazy.
She's got wine.
You're gonna stop.
She waited for him for hours.
Doctor, I'm sorry.
They made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
It's a very interesting story.
They have two sons and one daughter.
That was 2,000 years ago.
Tom's probably gonna take care of it.
It should be the right color.
Tom's very hard mom.
After a brief peace, the war was over again.
It's better not to trust Tom.
Just talk to Tom.
Can I remind you of your promise?
The Netherlands is Amsterdam.
I don't understand your French.
What's the name of this restaurant?
Excuse me, couldn't you give me sugar?
Where exactly is Tom planning to build his house?
"Where's my notebook?" "On the table."
I don't think there'll be any problems.
Did Tom break up?
You need to get up.
Green's on your way.
Success comes with education.
I don't like you anymore.
Mary's playing football.
How does it work?
You're very creative.
Come on, guys.
I'll fix the sunflower.
When is he expected to return?
I had a good rest.
He's not better than his sister.
Tom is Mary.
I'm making a lot of mistakes.
He does not fear death.
It would be good if there were 28 hours in time, wouldn't it?
Cobe is the town where I was born.
He wanted this disaster to stop.
We do not expect victory.
I don't have any money.
I'm not doing it here anymore.
We didn't find the guy.
Go to the bus.
Why didn't you help him?
I need to call Tom.
What advice can you give me?
I'm the only one you can trust.
He's di-jay.
Tom soon learned to swim.
What's wrong with what I did?
They're capable of fishing.
Tom left the room.
I'm still busy this Monday.
I want you to eat something.
He received the first prize.
Tom is a Frenchman.
I was trying to get in touch with her.
Give me your phone.
You're not funny.
Tom said he thinks he can do this.
I don't have a book.
The next story is true.
I just saw them together.
She watched him swim.
Tom thanked Mary for the gift card.
Can you remember when we first met?
My job is very boring.
He's, like, a man-worker.
Answer the question!
You need to go to the hospital.
I can't find any clues.
It's a piece of work.
It's not Tom who asked Mary to do this.
He's got green eyes.
Yours was better.
Tom often makes mistakes.
He felt tired.
Did I vote for Tom or Mary?
I don't have any friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope so.
That's funny, but it's true.
Is it true that Tom was never in Australia?
Now I understand.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned off the TV, and there was a Gran-Pri.
Tom's drinking a girl.
Don't remember.
I'm rich.
Have you considered the possibility of amputation?
I was surprised that Tom wanted to do this.
English is not my native language.
I had no friends in Australia.
You think I'm hungry?
I'm too rich.
What's the name of this girl?
We shouldn't have let her go.
So you don't have to do this again.
They've lived here for ten years.
Tom ran to Mary.
Her neighbor takes care of the children until she's gone.
I'm cooking now.
Did I see Tom's passport?
You want to dance?
He is often late.
Do you remember that summer when Tom hit his head?
Why did Tom do that?
I know this girl's father.
It's my third marriage.
Tom can't go with us.
I've got 30 eyes.
If I don't do this, Tom's gonna get upset.
Aren't you a psychologist?
Isn't that what you're writing?
A big tree fell on the road, and when I walked away, the road broke down.
I like Tom's company.
Not all the gold that shines.
I don't have a lot of friends.
Do you believe in God?
I live in Boston.
Tom is blind from birth.
You didn't answer my question.
Does anyone know him?
Are you not beginning to murmur?
What kind of men do you like?
Why are people still burning?
I won't work for you.
I can do this for her, unlike you.
I'm a student, and he's not.
I tried to do this myself.
I wrote a book.
Quiet, please.
I bought my son a new chance.
I know Tom's wife.
This is my younger sister Sakiko, who was born the same year that I was, and now she's preparing for exams.
I don't like tea or coffee.
Did you do your homework?
Monday may be a busy day.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I don't agree with him.
Perhaps you need to help him paint a park.
Why do people act like big bugs and instead of something?
Can you help me?
That's stupid.
I'm a physicist.
I think you should go back to the doctor.
I put the documents on the visa.
It's snowing today.
She kept working.
The motif broke when we went up.
Tom's in trouble.
If you ate less hamburgers, you'd probably be healthier.
Tom helped Mary.
Good choice!
Don't you want ice?
Is Mary not going?
What's in the garage?
Don't you speak English?
Tom needs to go to the hospital.
I had to go personally.
Please show me how this is done.
Don't you see anyone?
All the lights are busy.
Until I made my decision.
What's the date today?
Where's Dad?
Close the door.
I won't talk to Tom French.
The apple is not far from the apple.
Be realistic.
Who are you talking to?
Uncle is your father’s brother or mother.
You know who they are?
In her red eyes.
They're not coming back.
I was in the jeans.
I'll see you after the show.
I'd like to ask you a question.
It's my grandmother.
It's a kite.
This is my bag.
Are you ignoring me?
Tom joined Satan’s Church.
I still want to do this with you.
Tom has no money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm careful.
You don't mind?
I haven't seen you for all eternity.
You're obviously right.
Who are these books?
You want to do this, don't you?
You want to kill me.
See?
Tom plays a dog twice a day.
Let me look at this book, Tom.
Japan’s main islands are Hockcaydo, Sycocao, Honsu, and Kyusu.
You must be very busy.
Tom doesn't have much money in the bank.
I think we should go now.
We didn't do that.
You think Tom's crazy?
I can do it now.
How can you be so naive?
I won't help you.
Get down.
I'm not a monster.
She's hurt her eyes.
No one can compare with him in tennis.
Who did I ask you?
When did you get that?
She committed suicide.
We've got our office with computers.
I need to pay it all the time.
Are you sure?
You think Tom's dead?
Are you not planning on staying?
I didn't do what you blamed me for.
Please don't be late.
I know Tom's drunk.
Did you agree?
I came to pick up my book.
I'm still making French.
Tom's gonna do it right away.
Let's sing a song together.
Tom has a third more book than I do.
You missed a lot.
I'm wearing shoes.
You can count on me.
His book became the subject of criticism.
It's going to be great.
I'm really scared.
You have to help her, and quickly!
It's much worse.
I'm in the shower.
You didn't waste your time.
Who knows when Tom will do that?
Tom witnessed to Mary.
I thought you were gone.
Tom doesn't hurt Mary.
Can I ask you what your name is?
I wrote you ten letters.
What should we do?
Aren't you going to vote?
You need to quit smoking.
I think Tom's betraying.
I know many French teachers.
You're not like her at all.
Can you play on the script?
Can you give me a hand?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom's good at speaking French.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's unhappy.
He was very popular among both students and translators.
You won't help with the tears of grief.
Tom's playing football and running.
You can go wherever you want.
We'll meet Tom later.
I know how we can have a good time.
You knew Tom couldn't speak French?
He always sings when he receives a soul.
You're not young like Tom.
How are we doing?
Then Tom raised his ear.
I'll be right back.
The church is located at the foot of the mountain.
Where's your assistant?
Why did I do that to you?
I'll have coffee, please.
Tom is trying to convince Mary to do this.
Tom's calling you.
You have to tell Tom he did it.
He speaks to the Spanish with a small French accent.
It's not yours.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't handle it.
She's got a nice way.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom's coming to my party.
Tom told me he didn't like to speak French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a tax collector.
I'll deal with it.
Did you find any mistakes?
I'd like to see your mother.
Are you a magician?
Am I good?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
They're out.
You're gonna let him move you?
You're a beautiful woman.
Hope is.
When I was a child, I was very shy.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
Tom poured Mary a beer.
How did you know Tom wouldn't be here?
Children grow so fast.
Tom likes to talk.
I want to play on the map.
He went back to the hotel.
When did you get back from London?
Aren't you still cold?
The noses of the tongue follow the rules of their tongue, even if they do not recognize them.
Tom's on vacation.
What if I press this button?
The thinkers threw their swords into the elephant.
No one cares.
They tried.
Tom and Mary are still here?
Tom’s wife is a Canadian.
Do you have an allergic reaction?
Don't go.
Tom and Mary couldn't help me do that.
I'd like to take the money away.
I'm pushing Tom's hand.
They'll be all right.
Half of these apples are yellow.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
You shouldn't worry about tomorrow's exam.
Tom was voting?
I'll be back.
Tom won't force Mary to do this.
Tom didn't even start.
Instead of going to school, he stayed home.
I didn't know it was Tom who helped you paint the park.
It's on the eighth floor.
Tom's wife left him three months ago.
I'm sorry I went there.
You don't have to trust her.
Tom lost his best friend.
Tom's gonna want to come.
Don't run.
I'm Japanese, but I'm not living in Japan.
What do you want to vote for?
Where did you get the cannibals?
This year you've received a gift from Tom?
I still feel a little tired at home, and so many things seem strange to me.
Sometimes I have a memory problem.
Where's Mom?
He was killed three hours after the accident.
You speak Macedonian?
There's no need to talk.
Are you talking about us?
Tom's with me now.
Tom's all right?
I thought you met Tom.
Very good!
You know why?
Check voice mail.
She speaks three foreign languages.
Tom's a little out of the graph.
Tom's not a hero.
Can I get a cab here?
Hurry up, 'cause you're late.
That's gonna be hard.
Does Tom always do that to himself?
I like to play golf.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn't want to talk so loud.
Our team needs your help.
You'll never break.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
It's all working, you'll see.
She left him.
Tom's safe.
I finally got water rights.
I'm not a student.
That's why Mary was sorry.
I'm just watching the news now.
Tom keeps checking his phone.
How's the wife?
You're right.
Tom's not rich, but Mary's rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite hand.
Everyone's late, except me.
Stop it!
It's a book.
I'm not going to miss the boat.
Don't waste money.
Tom's got a lot of weird ideas.
Eat something.
I'm with the client.
I'm disappointed in your effectiveness.
Didn't you have a car before?
Were you at work?
What are you learning?
I'm sorry I took those shots.
Good morning.
Please write your name to the olive tree.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She totally ignores me.
Tom's going to the game tonight.
I was talking.
She went to the airport.
She is studying Portuguese in Brazil.
What will you tell them?
How did you know this was going to happen?
What's up there?
If the natural language can be compared to the tree that develops over time, it can be compared to the plastic tree that was made of dust.
They all wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom's in Boston.
You know where we're going?
Tom doesn't know what he needs to do.
Don't be so sad.
Tom has a nice garden.
I know when you're breaking up.
I know you just did your job.
We're gonna go get some.
Tom said what happened?
I finally realized I wasn't in love with you.
Did you tell Tom I was kidding?
So it was terrible.
Tom said I'm fine.
I'll be in the lab.
Please wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's impatient.
Today, I need to do a lot of things.
Tom and Mary both will be there.
What do you understand?
Do they suspect me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to say hello to her.
Get the hell out of here.
Aren't you coming back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a Boston map?
Your sister's always wonderful.
This will be very difficult to do.
The child was paralyzed by fear.
Do you like these perfumes?
What a terrible thing!
Are you hurrying?
I don't have two cats.
When you hire him, you should take into account his youth.
We're sure it wasn't an accident.
That's his boring idea.
That's the truth of the principle.
Tom didn't want to leave the room.
He knows I love him.
I don't believe that.
I was in a white dress.
Check it again.
Tom has a son-in-law.
I know it'll be impossible.
Do you have anything from the main pain?
Children follow friends rather than parents.
Tom's falling.
Tom wants to play with his friends outside.
Whatever happens, keep calm.
Tom sent Mary a message.
He's always happy.
When Mary arrived at the bus stop, the last bus left.
Tom's in a black coat today.
I'll wait till 2:30.
Tom is my child.
We usually spoke French.
Bananas are delicious.
They're eating.
Tom can go.
Where are you staying?
Now they're nothing.
Did I try to talk to them?
This was much harder to do than it seemed.
Her friends laughed at her.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I was saying.
I doubt Tom could win.
The unplanned birds fly and pick up our work.
Don't worry.
Belle made a phone call in 1876.
You're going for a walk?
Tom said Mary was good.
He can't go anymore.
Tom and Mary are still asleep, right?
So he still likes Boston?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a medical doctor.
He walked along the border, and he didn't come back.
Collect your toys together.
This was much harder to do than it seemed.
I think I've got a bad feeling.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You have to do what Tom tells you.
I'm getting better.
Are these people crazy?
That's why it's interesting.
Have you finished your job?
Three years ago I was very rich.
That's hard to do.
Tom's dead.
I like being alone.
We were both drunk.
I'm not as tall as my brother, but higher than my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask you for help?
Tom took one of the boaters.
I never lived in Boston.
It's important to me.
This box was a note.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
I wanted to sell it anyway.
Tom said that, in his opinion, Mary wouldn't be.
You missed something.
I called Tom right away.
You seemed interested.
It'll help.
I'll sleep.
I told Mary in French that I love her.
We don't really have a choice.
I'm dead.
He worked hard to reach his goal.
In Kena's two cats.
I understood why I was wrong.
I like rides.
The phone doesn't work.
That's what we want.
Tom's in sunglasses.
Tom's good at painting.
All you need to do is press the red button.
You looked very sad.
Where can you get a suit for Halloween?
Tom's busy, and he can't help you right now.
We don't pay.
He wants to see you.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary were trying.
I think I'm getting hot.
Why don't you sleep?
Does Tom really think that someone is listening?
I don't think it's necessary!
Tom, you can say, nice.
Anyway, I don't agree with you.
I had to go sooner.
I've met him casually.
Why does she like you?
The problem is that solar energy is too much.
I'm very old.
Tom's lying.
You saved my life.
Did you call him?
Do you understand?
Tom wasn't rude to me.
How about thanking Japanese?
She's sleeping.
Tom’s wife asked him to quit his job.
You couldn't open the door?
You got a hand?
This sheet is made of plastic.
Tom could and should have helped Mary.
Don't you know how?
He had breast-feeding.
I played baseball.
She deserves a better life.
I've got a quote from the store.
You're such a impatient man.
What's going on here?
Tom said you speak French.
I did everything I could.
No, sir, she's free.
I love studying French.
I've been good to the cat, please.
I don't have time to read.
Do you have a literate that I could borrow?
I'm going to the store.
Don't trust anyone.
I'm glad you're satisfied with your work.
Are you working around here?
You admit it, don't you?
I have business tomorrow.

I heard you kissed Tom.
Go! Go!
Maybe I was wrong.

Are you French or English?
He's back in line.
Just keep doing what you're doing.
I made three mistakes.
There are no rules, but there are some exceptions.
