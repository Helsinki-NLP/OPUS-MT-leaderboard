Barack Obama will be awarded as the fourth American president of Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama is arriving in the North Osla for 26 hours to take the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth American president in history.
Diploma, medallion and a $1.4 million check will be provided in addition to exceptional efforts to strengthen the world's diplomacy and cooperation among the nations.
The head of the White House will fly to the Norwegian Metro in the morning, along with Michelle's wife, and he will have it full.
Firstly, it is invited to the Nobel Institute, where it is the first meeting of the five members of the committee chosen by 172 people and 33 organisations in October.
The president's couple has a planned meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will feature a festival to which Obama will take a prestigious evaluation.
He gets it as a fourth president of the United States, but the third one, which is the price he gets directly in the office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will be talking about the Afghan war in the course of the evaluation.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he is aware that the price will be taken as the president who is currently fighting in two countries.
A few days ago, he even increased his efforts by sending another unit to Afghanistan, which does not forget to highlight any of his critics.
At Obama's ceremony, he also holds gold medals, diplomas, and check for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
You're willing to give it to charity, but you haven't decided on a particular chart yet.
Then the President will take the lead in the bank, where the Prime Minister and 250 other guests are also invited, in addition to the king of Norway and the queen.
From the beginning, both of them made themselves more stable.
He suggested, for example, that he feels that he does not deserve it.
Several times he also noticed that it is not only for him but for all who are striving for the same value as him.
Right after the announcement, he said it was "increasing to action".
Protection of the animal from exposure
The Lithuanian police accused the president of the civil society of the Litomoreca Nature Protection Society of the extraction.
In a number of cases last year, he called for a construction operation, asked investors for money for his benefit, said Lithuanian police spokesman Alan Romov.
The chairman of the Litomeric Society for Nature's Protection is Lubomír Student.
Now he's in jail and he's been threatened for three years.
The triad container Brnu is very vulnerable
In Prague, ordinary people can classify the beans from beverages, and in the South Morovian neighborhoods, you can also fill three thirds of the containers on every step.
And in Brno?
That's where you won a few minutes before you find a suitable pool.
I don't want to say he's never going to go back to Brne.
But it comes to me that we are the second largest city in the Republic, they have little interest in this problem.
Brno is in the spring of waste classification not only because, as a citizen, we can still hold only paper, glass and plastics in third-party containers, but especially by the number of sinks on such waste.
Have you ever tried at the center, for example, to throw PET lashes into the collection basket?
It's a ready suit, especially it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I've ever seen is in the Morovian place against the Potrefene Huse.
Don't let Mr. Anderk and his colleagues hurt me, but I'm gonna get a little fucking shit.
It does not mean that in other parts there is no classing of waste at any time.
My friends' orders don't make it any better.
It's slow.
They've got it all the way to the pool.
I'm not surprised.
I've offered myself for the celebration to release a couple of glass and plastic bottles.
I just didn't see any color pool on the Kounic street.
Luckily, I found my way to the beach in the right place.
However, the wastes from him were gone.
Because it's still the center of Brna, which probably represents the city most, right?
It's only ecological and some aesthetics that probably bronchal socialists don't care much about.
This city prefers to buy hockey extraligue, which will make us tired throughout the Republic more than buy a couple of containers and offer other raw materials for cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I've been able to confirm official statistics for a while by browsing the Internet.
According to the ECO-COM company data, Brno is indeed the worst in the entire country of Jyomorav.
"Paroubk's" bill took money on loans and incapacitated.
After adding the left to the government's opinion to farmers or officials, it must not be in the budget of money on pensions, disability or construction.
But also on the levels of state debt or international court disputes.
This has added to the problems of those who will rule in the second half of the next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janotot.
When social democracies and communists passed on to some groups, they relied on the government to pay additional loans for emotional expenditure, pensions, or incapacitated government. "It's just putting problems into the future, mining," Janato says.
Of the money you've earned, you've got to go back to the higher levels, and you've got to go back.
Too much choice, where to take it, there's no state.
If it does not reduce the social doses or costs of state travel, it must raise taxes.
All the ones on the left now: teachers, teachers, farmers.
And later on, their children.
There's no fear that people will be afraid of the pensions or of the incapacitated cost of 1.8 billion.
However, for the price of being more debt - the next year will not be lost in the balance of just 163 billion, but more.
Despite my efforts by Minister Janoty, I am working so hard as to increase the pace and cost.
The state will need money on its reward and will no longer be able to raise DPH or reduce the maternal rate as the government did in its anti-deficiency package.
Because of transfers of money in favour of several groups of voters the next year will also miss five billion for the delivery of the distance and rails.
It is mainly due to heavy and dissuasive tasks that are no longer being planned and, where appropriate, depleted.
At least to preserve, which is not free either.
This means that the delay or the cessation of the thirty major buildings, which is also threatened by the freezing of European money, will protect the speaking ministry of the transport of Karel Hanzelka.
The ČSSD proposed that the money exchange be resolved in shalamounski – a sash to the ČEZ dividend, which is mainly owned by the ČEZ, and a transport fund.
The problem is that higher dividends are never safe, and they are no longer a waste.
Loni added from the Czech Republic to the budget of 18 billion.
Each year, the dividend pays for the liquidation of environmental damages, supplements or serves as a reserve for the progressive pension reform.
In addition, this trend, according to EU rules, increases the actual budget deficit by 5.7 per cent of GDP.
But that's not the end of the movement.
Nearly three billion have been killed in the budget for various damages to communism and criminal acts or for expenditure on court disputes, even on construction disputes.
If it's gonna happen without that money, it's not safe.
It's a lottery.
If we lose some international dispute, we'll have to pay the same amount, Janotot says.
The Minister will then have to save the money within the resort or, in the worst case, put it on the government budget reserve.
Hundreds of millions are also missing an already developed two billion-billion-dollar project, which should be able to monitor on-line what the individual agencies are losing.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister didn't find another money, the project would have to stop, the sanctions would have to be brought, it'd have to be protected by Janot.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
Americans are counting on a mobile phone that will be used to switch between different operating systems by clicking on one button.
The hidden plans seem promising.
There's enough press one key and you'll be moving from Windows Mobile to Android within a few seconds.
This is exactly the opportunity for an American company VMware, which focuses mainly on developing virtual software for computers.
We'll get you two user profiles on your cell phone together.
You can stop them, you can divide them into households and jobs.
They will both work in one moment and at the same time mark Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware in a chat room for a computerworld store.
It was presented in November of the last year and was first presented a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is no match.
VMware has already successfully presented a test sample of smartphones with two operating systems.
It was prepared by Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, on which Windows Mobile and Android systems were currently running alongside them.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full operation.
VMware currently works with European and American operators to test the virtualization of smartphones and devices should be provided to customers during 2012.
Lack of snow on the tops of the hotel
The hot chairs don't care about the Krknošts only.
The lack of snow also affects people from ordering ski resorts in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonoši, free rooms are still available at all winter times, including Vánoc and Silvestra.
The presence on our pages is great.
People are making offers, finding prices, but they're still afraid to order.
And if they call us, they'll immediately ask if we think they'll be Christmas on snow or in blue," said the information portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Anyone who wants to live in Silvestrovska in Špindler Mlīn, exactly according to his own idea, should not be in trouble with the order.
Anyone who gives priority to slowing money and the quality of staying is there until the second place, he can still try to wait a few days.
Spindler's hotels are still offering more than a week's stay on Silvestra.
I think they'll try to marry them for a while, but then they'll let and go for a short time.
And then they'll be free to kill quickly," Jandura said.
The free bed in all winters is still offered by the Entours Highway Office.
Now we're most interested in a holiday week that's not yet sold.
Still half the place in our offer remains open.
That's why we've already found some milder summer stay for the last time," said Director Ingtorsu Petr Schiefert.
Silvestra in Krkonoše can also offer a top-level travel office, but less free places are available.
Good to take off even the first fourteen days in the oven, the remaining winters are sold on average.
This year's interest in winter stay has a negative impact on the fact that there are still no snow in Krkonos.
People are waiting for him to attack.
No one wants to spend the end of the year on the mountains without snow.
If the weeks are filled, they are also sold during the week," Schiefert says.
On the other hand, there is something better than the villas that can accommodate the rooms of the Horizon Hotel in Peci under the Snow.
We're about five percent better.
We have the last few places on Silvestra and Friday.
It's a great interest in Polish holidays in January and it's sold well," the director of the best hotel in the world told Karel Rada.
Out of 80 percent, the hotel Omnia is located in the central park of Janski Lázní.
On the other hand, on Váce, she remains in the latest Jancolazean hotel, half of the beds are free.
This year, we've been surprised by the ice, which we've already had at the moment, about sixteen percent.
It's a little worse, but as soon as snow strikes, interest in living in Krkonoši will definitely rise, the manager of the hotel Omnia Erik Sporysch introduced.
However, for the greater benefit of snow, there is still a need to let the hotel stay hungry.
On Thursday, if there are any conflicts, there should be snow on the mountains.
But then he has to come back to the hotel, he informed Jiri Jakubski of the building work of the Czech hydrometeorological institution.
USA: packaging is the mother of wisdom
He is as comical as the school student Barack Obama, president of the most brilliant story in the Afghan question of his predecessor's strategy, which he himself proved to be the most foolish.
Finally, when he was drinking his heavily anticipated Afghan doctrine, it was shown that he described it through a copy of the Iraqi script from Bush three years ago.
Not only does he use the word "as in Iraq" several times in the same text, but he did not even use the name Bush as his personal declaration in January 2007: "New road ahead".
At the same time, three years ago he criticized Bush's idea to send pure military forces to Iraq in a civil war created as "unresponsible and in its consequences of catastrophic decisions".
However, the following months have shown that Bush's strategy based on the recommendation of full leaders was the only possible and successful way that today's reporting reports about Iraq are not talking at all.
Bush did not improve his reputation, but he objectively left his successor much more grateful than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama's hope is that the miracle is coming.
The military contingent was re-enacted by full commanders, particularly the senior Afghan Operation Chief Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordinating practice, was severely critical of the White House.
He asked 40 thousand men to break the situation to the best.
The president was in pain for three months, but he didn't get any better, and at least he burned down a total of 10,000 soldiers.
In Europe, he was able to count some 5,000 others, even though he initially counted at least 10.
The most challenging of the entire Obama strategy seems to be his intention to start the formation of an army from Afghanistan for 18 months and end this process for three years. The entire Obama doctrine raises more questions than answers.
Many doubt that half the increase gives the same fruit as the pace in Iraq.
Even during the brutal war in recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well organized, and its leaders respect the agreements.
The Afghan situation is marked by a negative sign - no one can rely on it and no agreements will be reached.
It is wrong to prepare Afghan security forces normally for the day to change the Lord according to what happens to them.
Political institutions, even if formally established, will only remain in the village of Poemkin, where they will continue to have patriarchal tribal relations.
The assessment of the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complex due to the invisibility of measures that are increasingly complex in Pakistan and Iran.
Neither the construction of an "accessible state", which is a minimalistic objective of the entire operation, does not seem too real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy violates its volunteerism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated and is now on the brink of the explosion.
Believe that soldiers are sent to war camps for the purpose of "the sudden return of home" cause a miracle done here, only souls can really be romantic, the reality is not touched.
From a political point of view, it is the determination of the date of the invasion of the army of Chiro, because Taliban will consider it an unacceptable recognition of American invasion.
NATO's last summary showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in war operations in Afghanistan is declining.
European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the safety of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Indian subcontinent.
Another factor in the ability to deal radically with the situation is the development of events across Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions in Iran are not effective, a question arises before the United States of America, which seemed to be not going to try to solve the military force problem.
The answer will need to be answered right at a time when, according to both, America is moving towards victory from Afghanistan.
Each such solution will also mean a dramatic turn of events in the Afghan situation.
The only payment for Baracca Obama is the fact that there are three years of presidential elections, and so there is still enough time for him to come with another strategy, if this appears to be a total defeat.
Bank Manager Goldman Sachs will no longer receive rewards in cash
High-ranking U.S. Banks Goldman Sachs will not receive an annual fee in cash.
She announced that this was the company that reacts to the island’s criticism of its mural practices.
The group of 30 previous managers will receive money instead of the share that will be sold first in five years.
In addition, actions may be taken by managers in the event of excessive risk.
Goldman Sachs thus, according to Reuters agency, puts the effort to connect the reward to Wall Street with long-term effectiveness.
I believe that Wall Street is well aware of the wider direction it needs to be issued by the former JPMorgan Douglas Elliott investment banker.
The problem is in detail, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank became the target of criticism after it paid some 17 billion dollars (about 300 billion Kč) in the first three quarter of the year.
The total amount of compensation in the company per year according to the Reuters agency is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measures announced today.
High payments in the banking sector have become a major political issue in a number of countries with the coming financial crisis.
The United Kingdom in the middle announced that the banker's gross bonus of more than 25,000 pounds (gross of 72,000 Kč) would once charge a 10-percent tax.
He's making similar steps for France.
This year women won Nobel's price in all areas except physics
The record of five women in Stockholm today was taken from the hand of Swedish King Carl XVI. Gustava's annual Nobel Prize in professional categories and literature.
According to four scientists among them, there was also a German writer of the Romanian origin of Herta Müller.
Two U.S. biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider have received the Nobel Prize for Medicine, along with their native Jack Stostak for chromosomal research.
The price for chemistry was obtained by Israel Ada Jonathan, along with the American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, to explain the structure and functions of the fish.
The last Laureate had Nobel Prize for the economy she had received by American Elinor Ostrom and her country Oliver Williamson for economic management analysis.
The only professional category that took place this year without the holder was physics.
Scientists Charles Kao brought this price today for research in the field of optical fibres and George Smith and Willard Boyle to find a CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical telescopes.
Each evaluation carried out a diploma, Nobel medals and a certificate of financial rewards.
This one in each category reaches ten million Swedish kroner (a total of 25 million Kč).
If they're listed in each of them, I'll take revenge on each other.
Traditionally the most unexpected Nobel prize for peace has already been received this afternoon by President Barack Obama in the North Oslam.
In his speech, he recognized the contradiction of his assessment, because he was the first to begin his journeys, and he was in front of the country to lead two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
However, he added that wars are in a certain position necessary to combat peace, even though the price for that is high.
Minister Janotot is considering the commissions, Klaus invited him to the City.
President Václav Klaus will take on Friday morning Minister of Finance Eduardo Janotu, who is considering staying in the government, because he does not agree with the kind of state budget for the next year as he was admitted in the middle of the parliamentary record.
It is expected that the budget and perhaps Janot's stay in the office will be the subject of their Friday meetings.
The beginning is also critical of Klaus.
According to him, he has a very high deficit, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The meeting was briefed by the presidents of the speaker Radim Okhvat.
Janota wants to meet with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the law on the budget, which Klaus will now receive for signature, the Czech Republic should manage a total of 163 billion dollars.
However, in the middle of the debate, the motion for a left-wing money was agreed and raised money to pay public employees, to provide social services and to pay directly to farmers.
The government has been calling for proposals for social democracy to raise the cost of the budget secretly.
Between the left and the left, Klaus and the right on the other side, a sharp internal political dispute arose because of which one began to raise questions about the next move by the Fischer official office, on which the formation of ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party agreed.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by the Court of Justice, essentially eliminates the package of countermeasures that the Government of Fischer undertook and which, according to it, has to stop the State's liability.
The clause that the law on state budget can, but also must not sign, on today's discussion morning with entrepreneurs, stated that politicians have long forgotten "a serious problem", which is "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
He doesn't think he has a good solution today.
The improvement could only bring about a strong government, which could also stop the wider consensus of political parties, the president said.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek stated that the budget is terrible and the government should consider other existences.
The president of ODS Petr Nehes told the ČTK that the concept of the official office with the support of ČSSD, ODS and greens is no longer clearly functioning.
Prime Minister Fischer in response identified similar words for "strong outputs".
Chief of the ČSSD Jírí Paroubek at Topolanka responded by saying that it was a terrible loss of budget that was prepared by the former Government of Topolan for this year and that exceeds 200 billion dollars.
In the medium term, ČSSD has already indicated the approval of the State budget for the next year for success.
The rest were also the people.
You played Morgan Freeman in the newspaper Clint Eastwood.
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The undisputed world is much more about the country, its war and victory despite some criticisms that the major role of the American emperors is being created.
The story tells us about sports, racial boundaries and Nelson Mandel.
An outstanding warrior against the racist regime of apartheid in the Republic of South Africa and its first black President Nelson Mandela in his life story is the American archenemy Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he'd been asked by a 90-year-old Mandela to create him in Eastwood's movie.
He plays another important role in Matt Damon.
I said to him, "When I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
For example, a 20-year-old herec who won a role in Eastwood's drama in the middle of a box of millions of dollars babysitters has already created, for example, a lead for abortion, from which he eventually became a child, a firm president of the United States and even a god in God’s Evan, but usually only someone who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was 27 years old in prison for his active work to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and was then president of the country for four years.
In 1993, Nobel Peace Prize was awarded.
Invictus is a Latin word for uninterrupted and is the name of English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The test was to speak like him.
The picture is a true story of how Nelson Mandela worked with the captain of the South African gang team, Francoise Pienaar, to help unite the country. The newly elected president of Mandela knows that his people are still racially and economically divided after the apartheid.
He believes that he can connect his people through sport, so he decides to join the rappie players who are in the global dimension between outsiders.
The South African team finally arrives at World War 1995.
Freeman's been working for several years to get Mandel's story to pay off.
I had no other goal than to play this role so that I could get closer to it as real as possible, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to speak like him.
Hereek said that if he and the world's politicians were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandel, raise him, be in jail before his show.
The most important thing was that he wanted Mandel to hold his hand.
I found out when I'm printing your hand, I'm taking your energy, it's moving, and I had to feel like I know how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to be with another person.
Matt Damon is filming Françoise Pienaara, the captain of the national gang team in which white players carried.
Herec said he had six months to prepare for his role in the hard world of rape.
It was a great surprise for him finally when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember how I called on a home bell, he opened up to me, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, "I look much bigger in the movie."
Despite obvious differences in the positions of the emperors compared with their actual proposals under the direction of Director Eastwood, Invictus obtained: Unexploited bold reviews and talks about ambitions in Oscar.
A movie critic of the Daily Variety Todd McCarthy film was summed up in the words: "It was very good news, very good film done."
In film reviews on the website rotentoes.com, Invictus received 76% of positive evaluations.
Secrets of the Black Sea over Norway: Russian rocket tests
It was possible to observe the special light effect of an unknown source.
The Russian Ministry of Defence yesterday acknowledged that soon the Norwegian borders were testing the intercontinental ballistic missile.
But the start was a failure again and the shooting was marked as a type of "Bulava", which was supposed to be originally a clone of the Russian army, gradually becoming a black measure of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putina.
Even his repeated presence in rocket tests had no beneficial effect on the success of experimental years.
Most of the noise didn't get hurt or damaged in the air.
In Russian newspapers, it's already written about "Bulava" as "a rocket that doesn't fly."
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This in order has already been tried at the beginning normally.
By the end of the year, it was back to the technical damage of the device.
He must have fired the engine at the third level of the rocket.
This time, "Bulava" began with the atomic ponortic Dmitry Donski, which flew under the ice of the White Sea.
This type of rocket also allows the explosion of ships that are moving and at the same time detonated.
It is therefore likely that the western light caused by Norway is closer to the unaccompanied flying object, which was indeed "Bulava".
Recently, Nors had no doubts about the Russian rocket since the first time.
The generals are now defending themselves and claiming they cannot speak of success alone.
The first two levels of rockets were maintained and the accident occurred until the third.
In the previous cases, the engines were immediately broken up in the first step.
Even though he did not complete the course of one trial, only six out of the thirty failed leadership of the defence ministry has been granted.
Almost 10 percent success is therefore complemented by optimism and still claims that "Bulava" will once will fly without problems and that it will even take up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum mass of 1,15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract in CSKA Moscow in 51 years
The legendary defense of Vjačeslav Fetisov will again appear in the professional hockey race in 51 years.
The former world master, the Olympic winner and holder Stanley Cup will assist his team in the need of the CSKA Moscow team and will appear already in the five-way battle of KHL against Petrohrad.
Fetisov, who completed his career in the fourteenth year of 1998, is currently president of the CSKA.
After what happened to Dennis Kujaš, we need another defense.
Fatis regularly trained and agreed to help the team.
We just need to figure out some formalities, the AP agency quoted the eyes of the Moscow club Sergey Germany.
It's still unclear whether the comeback of the famous hockeys will affect just one match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can inspire the spirit of other players, introduced Germany.
Fetisov will thus become the oldest Russian professional hockeyist in case of a return to ice.
In NHL, he played in the 11th season for the Hartford legendary attacker, Gordie Howe, and enrolled 15 heads and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Casatonos - Makarov, Larion, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockeyists of history.
In a Soviet wedding, he won two Olympic gold, seven heads of the world's master, triumphed on Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he collected success in NHL, where he twice raised Stanley Cup head in Detroit.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the hockey Union.
Hyundai told the board that it's breaking all the time.
The management of Hyundai's truck agreed with the committees to cancel all the delays.
In particular, due to the frequent schedules, the committees in the afternoon declared emergency.
He confirmed it to speak cars Hyundai Petr Vanék.
However, the Committee wishes to agree with the Committee on another annual Saturday amendment.
We cannot refuse our production plan, which is essential, so it was proposed on Saturday, 19 December, with two changes being made, Vanék said.
Sedmička.cz server wrote that the company of employees who are working on the Saturday shift offered 400 Kč bonus.
They'll get people back on Saturday, November 28.
According to Vanuka, the company decided to change the incentive of employees for the proposed period.
Whether they are allowed to pay the fee in advance or they can choose the refund on December 28th, and then on the day after that they extend the holiday, Vanék said.
In addition, all employees of Saturday shifts will receive paid rides and lunch.
In view of the fact that the period was the most urgent and most fuelous point in view of the memory and problems of the committee members, and the protestors, who had stopped the production for the past week, Vanék pointed out last night's ruling on the immediate payment of all the transitional periods on the month of December.
In the past week, car workers were practically forced every day after the eight-hour change to work another two-year shift.
Following the signature of the Agreement, the members of the Committee of the Committee of the Regions shall withdraw the status quo
Another connection between driving a car and the councillors is to be held on Friday afternoon.
The chief of the committees of Petr Kucharj in the middle said that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the standstill.
The situation in the car deteriorated in the middle of the last week when the mass of 400 employees suddenly collapsed due to constant delays.
They also protested against bad pay terms and certain jokes.
The management stated that employees must be allowed to do so in due course in order to meet the requirements of the car supply.
The committee also requested that no sanctions be imposed on employees who had been suspended in the past Wednesday.
In the area of temporary work, the committees of the company require that they reduce the temporary work to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay 5000 crowns in the year.
Hyundai's footcar now employs 2,000 people.
The serial production of the company broke down in November.
At the annual summit, 80,000 vehicles were built, and its current production capacity was 200,000 cars per year.
Czech appearance: substance that also takes on HIV virus 'decided'
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new findings that can reduce the spread of HIV in the body.
The main benefit of improved substances is that it is also taking on viruses that have already been developed against immunodeficiency drugs.
In some cases, this fact is overestimated by the fact that the content of the normal variant of the virus does not affect as much as some of the available medicines.
No AIDS can ever be cured.
However, patients can significantly prolong the life of the combination of medicines that prevent the accumulation of HIV in their body.
However, their use has a number of side effects.
In addition, the incomplete accumulation of virus has resulted in the development of so-called resistant sources against which medicines are no longer effective.
The work of experts from the three institutions of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, from VŠCHT Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistant virus.
It has been shown that the substances called metalocarbones affect the protein responsible for the spread of HIV.
Metal carbonates are made up of war, water, coal and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus other than all medicines used today and can therefore overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come with new ‘improved’ phrases prepared on the basis of the knowledge of molecular mechanism of their relationship with viro-white.
Metal carbides have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-square cells made up of carbon atoms, hydrogen and carbon are combined with atoms of copper, in this case cobalt.
Vulnerable and offal virus
HIV protease is HIV protein, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV, the protease caused by HIV infection would not result in adult viral infections.
When we stop HIV protease, we also stop spreading the virus in the patient's body, scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemicals and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the CR.
In the work published in the journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe the series of sculpteds in which two pairs of cells (see table) are combined with a short organic network that is further systematically modified.
Something worse, but more reliable.
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease has been tested in the study and also in its slow (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metallocarborans on the normal version of enzyme is not as strong as in the clinical trials of the medicinal products used, but their effect is not lost for the resistant variants against which the drugs are used is often not effective.
The unique mechanism of effect and their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical adjustments such as metalocarbons make interesting conclusions for further research on the proposal of effective anti-HIV drugs, says Pavlín Rézečova, the leading laboratory of structural biology Institute of Organic Chemicals and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
I'm sorry. ODS left to Fischer, he's defending himself.
Chief of ODS Mirek Topolánek has identified the approved budget for the next year for "severe" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider another existence.
The ODS statement marked the president of the government for strong outputs.
He's leaving early on his analysis.
The president of ODS Petr Nehes said that the concept of the official office with the support of ČSSD, ODS and Green Party is no longer clearly functioning.
The President of the Government must decide, according to Time, whether it is possible to stop in a small way the fight against rising deficits or whether it is to remain in force with the help of the Parliamentary Left.
The approach of ODS and social democracy to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, alerting the Time.
In the medium term, the budget was adopted in 2010, along with the left-wing amendments for more than 12 billion dollars.
The government has raised money to pay public employees, to provide social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's response to social democracy's proposals was the fact that there was a hidden treasure in the budget.
The PRC should manage with a total of 163 billion dollars.
Before the vote, the ODS withdrew from the hall, responding to the request of the government that even the amended budget is less a bad option than the budget forecast.
Degrading and Marmotism
Minister of Finance Eduard Janota spoke of the loss and sense of guilt, Prime Minister Jan Fischer indicated that the government will still be in line with the current situation.
It is not time to believe that if Janetta had seriously threatened to leave the office in the event of the adoption of the amendments, the situation might have seemed different.
According to Czech TV, Janotat ordered on Mondays after the government went to the prime minister.
He meant that he was considering another maintenance in function.
The reason is his decline in the budget.
If Fischer speaks for another battle with the budget deficit, they have no time in the government to do what the ČSSD nominees have done, which changes in the budget have been made.
The Premier should also make it clear that he will give the commissions if he accepts other laws that increase the deficit, such as those relating to the weak, pensions or the new service law.
Top Plan: Ministers of appointment of ODS have failed
It's the matter of the Ministerial President of Fischer and the whole government.
Ministers of the appointment of ODS did nothing wrong, highlighted Topolánek in the US text message.
He recalled that in a number of ministries there are in municipal functions people voting for TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
He recently stressed that if Fischer decides to reject the principle of combating the high cost of public finances, "it is only logical and correct that it is contrary to the majority of the left that is currently in the market".
Then he can't count on the support and tolerance of civil democracies.
I didn't think about it, and when this is going to happen, I'm going to blame it, said to journalists in the military, Minister of Defence Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government by the right citizen of democracy.
The Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels this afternoon to meet with the European Council.
At the request of the ODS Prime Minister
At the same time, he stressed that, in the middle of the debate, ODS would obviously vote against the amended budget if the Prime Minister of the House of Citizens of Democrats had not expressly requested that the budget be adopted.
We do not appear to be orphans, we are not small children, then we have responded to the question whether the ODS did not challenge the impartiality of the presidency of the Parliament and the Czech Republic in the political statement on the budget.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
As soon as I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months, especially in terms of damage to the memory and destruction of all positives, I had to react to Topolánk myself.
According to the new order of the CD, less trains are eaten by nearly the same train
The Czech dragons from December 13 will break down or limit some less complicated speeds and locations, while others will be strengthened.
The total volume of transport shall be reduced from the date of entry into force of the new rail line compared to today by two per cent.
Most of the tariffs, including basic and customer traffic, shall not be changed.
For example, the people of Ostravska have more opportunities to connect to the main city, and the dragons add one pendolin adjustment.
On the contrary, the race will stop going to Bratislavy.
Less speeds will also go to Praha - Písek - České Budějovice, which is essentially limited directly to Praha - Letohrad.
In the regions, the main transport cuts are planned in the Kingdom, up to eight percent, and in contrast, Prague and the surrounding areas can be enjoyed.
There are also two night trains on Praha - Tábor - Czech Budějovice and a few speeds on Praha - Písek - Czech Budějovice is limited to a few days a week.
The biggest change is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovic to Prague, which today has to move to Lysé over Labe.
It's about the fifteenth line of the Esko local system, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrical operation from Lysé nad Labem to Milovic.
The long connections to the main city will end in Prague Main Station.
The ČD offers more connections between the SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperka/Jeseník in two-year intervals.
The pendoline to Bratislava is no longer connected since 13 December.
Annual accounts for regional railways: over 200 million
The quicksands order and pay the Ministry of Transport, on the whole of the so-called loss of evidence, give me dear next year four billion crowns, as well as this year. Locals order countries, all for which they pay eight billion crowns next year, while the other three billion countries are contributing to the state.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
On the premises and speeds have a newly closed ten-year contract, the contract has always been for one year.
The dragons are proud of the system, and it is evident that they do not want to increase the price of the wooden majority of the train.
The change will only take place in single network tracks of ČD Net and left internet links of eLiška.
For travel without customer cards ČD Net price increases from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLišky will be renewed from a comfortable distance, it has been a single 160 kroner for the journey between the cities of liberal countries.
The Philippines's armed forces are still holding more than 50 people, children are released
Today, the army of the South Philippines has sent 75 people, including a number of basic schools and their teachers.
This was introduced by the AFP agency, which originally informed only 65 individuals.
All 17 detained children were left, including one teacher, eight hours later.
In August we arrived in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 armed men used their hands as a live shield when they fled from the police.
Local contractors are now trying to agree to the release of the remaining hands.
According to AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is armed by the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP police agency, the original rape was followed by violence, which required the removal of accounts between two local family clans.
In the southern Philippines in the province of Maginanao, a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed was declared a state-of-the-art law.
There were 30 journalists among the victims of mass massacres on 23 November relating to elections to the government.
The governor of this southern Philippines province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, a patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family, was arrested for suspecting a massacre.
On the Isle of Mindanao are also Muslim separatists.
But on Tuesday, they renewed their peace talks with the Philippines government.
JAR experience concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The next day, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (official name in Czech calls Invictus: Undiscovered) will appear in the American cinema, which captures part of the life story of former President Nelson Mandely of the South African Republic.
The role of a conscious warrior against apartheid was raised by Morgan Freeman, who chose Mandela himself for his creation years ago.
The next man's role of the legendary South African champion in the Francoise Pienaara rupbe was raised by Matt Damon.
Introducing the picture into the cinema is based on the voices of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
The entire name of Nelson Rollighl Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in the South African Union.
In 1988, Sachar received the price for freedom of thought, and in 1993 he and De Klerk Nobel won the prize of peace.
The President of the South African Republic was in 1994-1999.
great expectations, as it comes to the public at a time when in the Republic of South Africa, however, preparations for a global football campaign are high, but the media are spreading disturbing reports of growing racial hatred and discrimination on the part of the majority of the population.
According to the news agency AP, the voices of the new film in JAR are currently very positive in the universe, even in the face of a number of prizes for the inclusion of the main role of "prolific" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, is according to his words on a new movie of pride.
I've been dreaming about that role for years and getting ready for it.
Many times I also met Nelson Mandell personally so that I - as it is called - spent his energy, introduced it in a speech after the famous film Prime Minister in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remind the film of Mandel's personality and message.
It's the history of the South African Republic, but it's all about every human being.
In the course of the national team of rupees
Photo based on British writer John Carlina's book presentation with a freely translated title In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that has given rise to the nation portraying the human rights of South Africa during his first presidential election period.
Thus, Morgan Freeman is trying to gather two races during the film and after many years of mutually disaggregated population groups and as in 1995 as in Nelson Mandela, he also participates in a heretical role in the South African national rupture at the World War, which was then won by JAR.
For the entrance to the dining room, which was understood to be almost sacred in JAR, Mandela had washed large flocks of mostly white people for fourteen years and obtained recognition of the white population.
The football industry may be able to re-connect people into one nation, introduced the gruesome player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the drinking situation in the JAR improves, it will be shown first.
The whites of South Africa, however, are skeptical, as was the case in a recent LN speech by the Russian photographer Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The campaign will begin on 11 June 2010.
On Lounska, the transformer for tens of millions of crowns
In the morning, the company transformer Čeps caught fire in the village of the University of Lounska.
He is in the fire, according to the language of the port of Lukáše Marvana, six units.
Initially, the teachers wanted to allow the transformer to burn, but later they changed their mind and fires the mixture of water, sand and special wastes.
The reason was the technical undertaking, the internal circuit of the transformer.
No one has been injured, according to the spokesman of Pauly Mandát's company, does not threaten the safe operation of the transport system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of dollars, exactly counting it until the fire ends.
The lost transformer will be replaced by a new one according to Mandato's need.
In the ten years of the Czech movement, there was nothing like it, the notions of this type have been united, complemented.
The supply of electricity was not affected by the ČEZ language of the northern Czech Republic, Soni Holinger Hendrik, the operation of the home, the offices or the fire company.
A.s. Čeps acts on the territory of Česka as an excellent transport system operator, 400 kV and 220 kV electrical controls.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 solutions with 67 transformers transforming electricity from transmission to distribution system and driving routes of 4339 kilometres.
Jancura gives a criminal notice for a speech on three hits from ČSSD
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Jancura gives a criminal notice for a speech on three social-democratic hits today.
And it's on Michal Haška from the Jihomorav region, Radko Martínk from the Pardubic region, and hetman from the Olomouk region of Martin Tesarík.
Jancura introduced it in the twenty-minute radio station.
The complaint relates to the efforts of companies to carry out regional train transport in some countries.
But all regions finally signed long-term contracts with Czech loved ones.
All three hostages attack us and talk about choosing races, so we brought only what they wanted.
He claims that we are more precious than the Czech dragons, which is not true, because we know the price of the Czech dragons that were closed last week.
So we don't have to defend ourselves.
It's about talking about student agency company, said the radio journal Jancura.
He also indicated that he has evidence from all countries that they have not taken their steps in accordance with European law.
It therefore prepares for the European Commission.
The criminal notification has been considered to be a further continuation of the media show of Mr Jancuri, which serves him as an unpaid advertising of his company and his own.
I am reasonably prepared to cover up my good name and my country, and to the same call and the rest of the hostages.
I assume that it will also be clear on this occasion that it is really Mr Jançura, who manipulates the public in regional rail transport and uses false and false arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura has already announced last week that it invests several millions of dollars in advertising that will warn of an unexplained step of the country.
The radio station said that the campaign after Christmas is breaking up and continuing in it after New Year's Eve.
He emphasized that the campaign would be known against corruption as such.
The campaign began with Jancura after the countries agreed to establish regional rail connections with the Czech dragons, and the ban of about 150 billion kroner was not signed.
According to Jancuri, it is similar to acting against the law and in dispute with the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
As a result of the criticism of rail transport in the countries, Jancüro has also threatened the ČSSD Ambassador.
The only challenge was that if we don't, we could get a bus license.
He represented himself as a messenger of the ČSSD, and I know what you're talking about, I won't tell you his name, said to the radio station Jancura today.
Hope against pneumonia will be free and optional
The anti-pneumococcal expected from the cold collection is the most common.
He's got to be the first for the family to be free and at least innocent.
But the voices are already calling for more effective expectations.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against foot-and-mouth disease.
The medical institution has already established the maximum vaccine prices to be paid to health insurance.
The experts are also clearly in the process of waiting.
New Expected
Free vaccines for Serbian children
Since January, children born on and after January 2nd can be expected free of charge against pneumonia.
The condition is that no dose of waiting has yet been found.
Anyone who starts to wait for a loan or a loan first has to pay for it himself.
The first dose of expectation should be given between 3 and 5 months of age of the child.
She had already voluntarily allowed her children to wait against the pneumococcals of the fourth family.
The parents paid 1600 kroner for a single dose and more.
Four doses are needed when expecting the youngest children.
All experts estimate that health insurance is issued at expected doses of 300 to 450 thousand kroner per year.
But he'll save it for the treatment that children need without expecting.
To date, the state for all flat expectations of children has given the ransom 500 thousand a year.
The rented expectation was introduced by the so-called Janot package.
Pneumococcal causes heart problems, but also serious infections, including strokes of the brain and blood vessels.
On a pneumatic infection in us every year, he will die from an investigation in hospitals up to 28 children up to 10 years of age.
In addition to Česka, there have been widespread expectations of children against pneumonia in about 40 countries.
Will the expectation be mandatory?
At the same time, however, opinions are made that this expectation may be mandatory in the future.
He's got to be surrounded by insurance and non-compulsory since January.
For example, the head of the civil society, Nahls Rudolf Kalovski, pointed out that it would be necessary to expect better.
His association of pneumococcal vaccines has long promoted.
The experts at the international conference, which was attended by our association, were not fully satisfied with our voluntary expectations.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we're glad that we got through at least this.
I think it's the road we've got to get up now.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the process of waiting against pneumonia.
We don't even think about it at this time, said his spokesman Vlastimil Srschön.
Voluntary expectation has its disadvantages, the doctors insist.
The President of the Committee of the Practical Children's Doctors Hana Cabrnoch acknowledges that he has voluntary expectations of his shortcomings.
If all children are expected, it could be considered a reduction in the number of expectations "For the situation where these vaccines are so high, we understand the political decision that this expectation was launched as voluntary," said Cabrnoch.
The experts expect that their rabbits will be allowed to expect pneumonia from the next year more than 80 percent of clean parents.
The expectation of pneumococcals is also excessive in that, as the first flat expectations of children, there is a health insurance, not a state.
Insurance should issue money to prevent, save for further treatment, explains Cabrnoch.
Doctors will have to buy the ingredients themselves.
However, it concerns the concerns of practical child doctors who are involved in the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, vaccines should be purchased by insurance and doctors would receive them as if they were being given other vaccines.
Some Members, however, were afraid that the insurance might "get money out of health insurance".
Doctors will therefore have to buy and wait until they have insurance payments.
According to estimates, individual practitioners will invest 40 thousand children in vaccines a month, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy at all, says Cabrnoch.
American artist's son's theft in the museum
The son of the renowned American fanist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal pictures worth $20 million (12 million dollars) from his father's museum.
The Pennsylvania police indicated that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was attached to his vehicle and conveying 90 images.
Mr Frazetta and the other man used to enter the museum in the Poconco Mountains barr region.
Mr. Frazetta senior, 81 years old, celebrated the creation of Barbara Conana and Tarzana.
At the time it happened, the artist found himself on Florida, as indicated by the Associated Press printing agency.
The AP quoted an appointed police officer who indicated that Mr. Frazetta could be motivated by long-term family disputes.
Before the police, Mr. Frazetta issued a younger mandatory statement, 52 years of age, that he did so at his father's direction, "to get to the museum in any way possible and move images into the sweeter spaces," said the agency.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denied any authorization as the agency has indicated.
Laborists are defending the planned increase in taxes
The Ministers charged the increase in the expenditure and cuts reported in the preliminary report against the criticism by opposition, businessmen and committees.
As Alistair Darling pointed out, Toryo's "promanded" option to show that they are seriously considering a decision to reduce deficit to time after elections.
And the facility got under the ball because of the achievement of low- and medium-income workers.
According to its proposal, it is mainly an increase of 0.5 % in social insurance and 1 % in the adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Difference in social security
The committees protested that the low income workers were subjected to restrictions that they did not object to and warned against "the problems".
Social security is increasing - the growth of about 3 billion people free annually - which has caused the Community of entrepreneurs to say that one of the taxes on employment should be reimbursed while the economy should be refocused.
This increase, which limits these revenues above 20,000 pounds per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
PBR Key Body
Social insurance increases by 0.5 % from April 2011
The economic situation is worse than expected, 4.75 % this year
New payment of 50 % of bankers' bonuses
Increase 1% tax to small companies for subscriptions
Reduction of taxes on electric cars and windscreens
An increase in the rate of 2,5 %
According to the national financial administration, some revenue of 30000 pounds decreases by 90 pounds per year and some revenue of 40000 pounds decreases by 190 pounds, while some revenue of 10000 pounds increase by 110 pounds.
Ministers announced that their objective of reducing deficit by half to 2013 was "complicated decision", but continued that 60% of special taxes should be due to 5% of the highest income.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms suggested that the proposed increase in tax and expenditure reduction would be "catch in the ocean" compared to what would be necessary.
"It's a big number, which allows us to reduce the deficit by half, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," BBC said.
Mr. Timms said he was convinced that the growth of the economy should take place in the past year.
But the development of forecasts for future economic growth - which will have an impact on the size of the necessary loans and on how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the office was given to review the previous sections.
In your opinion, the economic downturn was 4,75% this year - far higher than the 3.5% in depth forecast - because loans were 3 billion higher than previously estimated.
Proportional opportunity'
Conservatives who launched a new propaganda campaign on Thursday, warning against the "debt crisis" of the labor force, marked a planned loan of 789 billion pounds over the next six years.
When the ministers presented a credible plan, they added, "cynics" abandoned this decision until after the elections - which had to take place by June 2010.
"They didn't add anything important that would be feasible," said financial minister Philip Hammond. "They had a chance to do it, but they threw it away."
"All important notifications will be made after election if we win"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Laborists insist that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future damages, unlike Tory's proposals, which would want to reduce the deficit faster and more.
But liberal Democrats claim that the money earned by increasing the tax and cutting costs should be used to support expenditure in the coming year and not to reduce deficits, and they argue that the plans are "based on sand".
Political commentator BBC Nick Robinson pointed out the timing of the communication - for example, the inflation mentioned above is increasing and there is a lack of taxation in the next depth - that this could lead to the prosecution of the office in the election campaign, if the money would be hard to get back a year later.
But the labs continue to provide special assistance if people are going to need it very much and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
I'm looking at the budget.
Although ministers did not disclose the details of expenditure after 2011, the economy indicated that it was clear that the reduction of public expenditure would be only the beginning of medium-term restrictions.
The renowned Institute of Accounting reported that the number of cancers indicates the major gaps in many areas, possibly in the future, including transport, higher education and defence.
"It's really sick already," said his director Robert Chote.
"Every important announcement will come after the elections, if we win," added Roger Bootle, an economic adviser to the Auditor of Deloitte's accounts.
"It was a report of the suspect's preliminary budget, and the markets are implementing it."
The FBI is conducting an investigation into 'American Prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is conducting an investigation in a prison in Pakistan in five Americans suspected of being involved with extremists.
Men were arrested for an attack on the house in Sargod in the province of eastern Pangjab, as a BBC U.S. Embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI said it was an investigation whether it was the same as the men who were reported missing in their last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The US Ministry of Foreign Affairs has indicated that there is also information about these men.
Three of them are said to be the origin of Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian ancestors and the other comes from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were held and the circumstances they were held there," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
Speaking, FBI Katherine Schweit reported that the agency was informed of arrest and was in contact with families of missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and their attitude here and whether there is really one of the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington indicated that men were arrested in a house that belongs to one of them.
It said that the house was always in the interest of the local police and that there was not yet a charge against the arrested men.
Foreign Minister Hillry Clinton refused to comment on the arrest, sent a press agency Reuters, but stated that the United States must "co-operate with Afghanistan and Pakistan in the pursuit of the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The disappearance of these five students from home in northern Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Absence of amnesty for Iranian tyrants.
The situation in maintaining human rights in Iran is as bad as in the past 20 years, as the Amnesty International Group's report says.
The report describes "the means of torture" in the regime before and after the presidential elections in June.
One man said he was fighting and smoking cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected the above criticism of this report on the maintenance of human rights.
Officials have identified this criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed after President Mahmúd Ahmadinejad's campaign, leading to the largest street demonstrations since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
Ten of them were arrested and the complainants sentenced the last five persons to death.
The BBC writer in Tehran, John Leyne, who is now in London, stated that in the protests of the highest leader of Ajatoláh Alí Khomění, he declared some forms of torture illegal and prohibited them from being executed in the correctional facility of Karizak.
But since then, there have been almost no legal criticism of power, as our writer pointed out.
Irrefutable recognition
Amnesty International quoted a 26-year-old student's report on Ibrahim Metari's accounting technique, which stated that he was accused of "working with the Facebook network" and protests against the results of the election.
"They were often in my face," he said in his statement.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... threatened me with correction and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconsciously, told Amnesty.
In August, the presidential candidate Mehdi Charroub was defeated after the protests was arrested and sentenced to death in prison and the others were raped.
Iran's senior government officials filed charges of rape, but they admitted it to be torture.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who stated that he had been held in a container with 75 other persons for more than eight weeks in a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary had established committees to investigate arbitrary disturbances and government reactions, but indicated that the mandates and powers of the authorities were unclear and Parliamentary committees were banned.
The group indicated that at least 90 persons had been detained in the last three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
In the city park was made of woodware
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to change the memory in Bristol in the sedan road for the race.
The historical drive for the race in the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for the financial price.
At the top of the seating streets in Brandon Hill Park was a short jumpy museum before 100 m long seating.
A fourth-year-old medical student, John Hickman, said that it was a beautiful view from the top of the sedentary drama, but it was really exciting.
It was a beautiful view of the shining light of the city down.
Here were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them were real talents," he added.
Prices have been made for the best cuts - or manoeuvres on the sedentary drive.
After the fourth night of the competition, the snow was left to break.
They're mys.
Can he be a Muslim French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in secular states.
During the time when the Swiss voters called on the ban on the construction of minerals and generally spread frightening reports of European Islamic Islam, John Bowen, an American academic wrote and informed and wondered whether Muslims could integrate - and are integrated - into one of the most open secular societies in the continent.
After reading this book, some of the readers became surprised by the author of the last work, "Why Francouzi does not like to talk about his head" (2006), this elegant and discussed study on controversial issues that have divided and occupied the country for 15 years and their effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a broader and much more ambitious approach.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politics and the media have taught about Islam in France but what actually happened on the basis of it.
He spent the whole month in museums, schools and institutions that are now taking care of 5 and 6 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener, reproducing discussions between teachers and students on issues that are most worrying.
Should a Muslim enter a marriage union in a city or a workshop (or both places)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about the development and rights of gays?
Can a Muslim marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does Muslims have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system if you want to get a mortgage?
These are seemingly global disputes that are discussed and that are part of everyday life more than political dramas that employ media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other well-known persons, not including Tarika Ramadana, Arab, Muslim researcher and academics born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open discussions on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in modern secular society.
They have no arguments for all their customs.
Conservatives are untrustworthy to the real idea of French or European Islam.
Philosophy and activists with whom Mr. Bowen conducted the interview insist that one is against Selafi—priests of Sunni Islam, united in Saudi Arabia—this group is small, but affects European Muslims.
Mr. Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are random.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
The question of how far the French policies are (and the intellectual elite, which is so foolish to the public) has indeed been expressed by the thought of pluralism.
It is the view that Muslims have probably less experience in religious matters than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to make historical compromises with secular republics.
More than the development of pragmatism, he has found "the value of raw materials".
After reading this book, someone can say "Yes, but not now."
World’s Safest Views
The Arctic is changing faster than the rest of the planet's environment.
These alarming winds, which affect animals and their survival as nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fisheries companies must be focused on new natural water sources, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers at their disposal.
In the book "On the End" Richard Ellis, a writer and an illustrator, portrays the natural history of the icon of the North, the Polish bear.
A well-known and complicated history and civilization’s procedures describe the long tradition of Polish researchers who have tried to strengthen the white bear.
The meeting with Nelson with a brave fourteen-year-old sailor who fought only with a man's neck is really a myth, but all the others are true.
Young bears, who were carrying their own dead mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 Polish bears appeared simultaneously in one circus building.
Even today buildings in the zoo have typical area millions of times less than the area they have available to adult units in the divorcée. The climate is ideal: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the whole hair of its coat.

Mr. Ellis is taking part in the work of other writers and historians, and he often returns to the threat that hunters are threatening the survival of species.
Although hunting is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where the helicopter and Indians are on their way, and all are armed with powerful attackers that shoot their profit.
It's ironic that it's playing in the waters north of these two hunting nations and that ice will finally be the biggest.
In his new book "After the Ice" Alun Anderson, former editor New Scientist, offers clear and unsatisfied responsibility for the science of the Arctic and a long-term view of how its future can change.
Not all scientists have answers.
Even meteorologists and oceanographers have no adequate response to the rapid change.
That's for lack of test.

6000 seafarers spent hours at graveyards in Arlington
Lieutenant De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours by bus to put a simple prisoner on a soldier's grave, who never sat with him.
For him and other seafarers who traveled from Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington, to get rid of the horrors, it was the day when men and women who once wore the same suit.
In a few months when we were married, it could be us, Robinson told us about fallen soldiers.
If that happens to us, I'd like someone to do the same for me in order to show me the way I'm trying to do it.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered this Saturday morning to spend time on the Croatian veterans in several departments under the fifth Act in Arlington.
In 1992, Morris Worcester, owner of Worcester's funeral company in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to recover several hundred graveyards during the Southern Arlington Act.
Now it's 18 years old tradition when Mr. NMorill and his wife Karen are making this trip every year and is stopped in different cities along the road to attract the memory of members of the army and the victims of terrorism.
Worcesters are not looking for profits, debts against America, which are also in other countries.
In this year, more than 16,000 prisoners were placed in Arlington, the territory of the Pentagon, at the tombs at the Fayetteville National Memorial in Arkansas, at the Battery Park in New York City, and at the memorial site, number 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The next year, Walmart owes more than $150,000 to purchase and transfer bonds.
Charlene Hunt, 70, from Westminster, indicated that she had made her way to Arlington to the honor of her husband, a retired officer of the armed forces.
Since her husband was not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Huntt said it was her way to bring back what the victim was doing.
It's a small way that citizens can support our units, she said.
It's like a family funeral visit.
In the hot containers, volunteers passed through the caves after the surrounding grasslands and pahors.

U.S. government supplier bound by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government entrusted the U.S. government supplier with mobile phones and laptops to the country, as indicated by the officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
A supplier who has not yet been identified has worked for the Development Alternatives Inc. by staying in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the American Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, together with the American Interest Section in Havana, sought access to the detained person who was arrested on 5 December.
Certain charges have not been published, but according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a stranger may be imprisoned for almost anything that is known as "hazardous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including peaceful protests and critical states, pose a risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and words are considered to be serious criminal acts.
In Cuba there is a young blogging community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and burdened by government agencies.
Ms. Sánchez repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country so that she could take over the prices, but the permit was granted.
The arrest of an American supplier may be the result of increasing tension between the Communist Castor brother, who is ruling in Cuba, and Obama's administration, which has been seen as a "sustainable tactic" in improving relations with the island.
As the first report on New York Times' arrest on Friday night.
A new American policy emphasized that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as leaving political prisons and creating more room for opposition, the United States will take countermeasures.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed on Cuba, although they are new and sought-out comedys in the country where the average public employee's salary is 15 dollars a month.
The Cuban government has given ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; they are used mostly to send text messages because the 15-minute telephone call would be more than one day.
The use of the Internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and some government attachments, such as universities.
The Cubans who often want to sign up have to make their name known to the government.
Access to many websites is forbidden.
The arrest of the American in Cuba is a coincidence.
Most of the U.S. citizens in Cuba's prison are behind bars for drug trafficking, according to Gloria Berbeno, the Press Office of the Section for American Interests in Havana.
Ms. Berbeno said she couldn't provide more information about prison.
Prisons and detentions were clearly immoral.
Such activities, which in every other open society would be legal - let's make free mobile phones - are criminal in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the American human rights programme, recently published an unacceptable report of freedom in Cuba, called "New Castro, Dad Cuba," as a threat to the installation of Raula Castra as a leader of the country and compensation for Fidel's grave brother.
Vivanco stated that complaints are often arrested, imprisoned and imprisoned in one day.
He pointed out that any solution would be more political and that the Cuban government often triggers negative reactions in the United States, just as these two countries are leading to a broader dialogue.
Pakistani government officials are covering the crackdowns concerning the dispatch of men to Afghanistan.
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities revealed a certain leader of the conspiracy concerning the dispatch of five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill members of the US units and indicated that they hoped that this case would help to cover the vast network of terrorists who follow the Internet and seek radicalized young men.
The investigators indicated that they had chased after the seven rebel personalities known as Saifulláh, who invited these men to Pakistan after what was first reported when one of these men published a comment that approved terrorist attacks had a YouTube video show.
Saifillah took over the leadership of these men when they arrived in Pakistan, trying to help them get to the remote territory of Pakistan in a village of Pakistan's native tribes, which is home to al-Qaedy and its terrorist training camps.
But the Pakistani reporting officer who reported the case indicated on Saturday that Saifullah was unsuccessful in witnessing the leaders of al-Qaedy and that men were not part of the CIA's investigation of infiltration into a terrorist network.
As a result, after a few days, they were exiled to the eastern quarter of Sarghody, far from the terrible mountains in the northwestern part, which became the target of the terrorist attack.
They were considered to be an official unit.
That's why they were punished, the officer who spoke about maintaining anonymity in view of the sensitivity of the case.
The officer stated that the men were not afraid and were still trying to reach an agreement to access Al-Qaedy camps when they were arrested for violating Pakistani law.
The case of this fifth - which remained in Pakistan and has been heard by the FBI - highlights the critical role of voters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, which is much more important, determining who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US intelligence service has placed the highest priority on efforts to place human resources in al-Qaeda.
The leaders of the organization act as guards, drawing out those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the Holy War and those who could be experts.
The U.S. fake recruits were detailed in al-Qaedy's special investigation, the analysts said.
However, they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential access to the American goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, the senior analysis of the NEFA surrender in the United States, stated that in recent years terrorist groups have also become more closely aware of the fact that it is possible to join them because American intelligence agencies have gained experts in their collection methods.
If we are trying to get into these groups, there is no better way than to do according to their model of assembly, which has already been followed? Mr. Kohlmann said.
This model is one of those that are far more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protested in Kodana, demanding climate action
Tens of protestors followed the streets of this Saturday and requested greater action on climate than delegates at the city congress centre of Bella.
The protesting pointed out the number of participants in the event, but the police insist that the number was close to 25,000.
The event was relatively calm and a handful of masked activists placed several small deposits near the government building group in the city center.
On the day that a small event took place during the talks on the climate that was sponsored by the UN, thousands of activists went through the city and brought transparency with English letters "This is not planet B" (i.e. second class) and one in Spanish, who voted "The Earth says 'sufficient'."
Several celebrites, including the Danish models and photographs of Helen Christensen, participated in the protest, which indicated that she had traveled to her mother's home in Peru and provided me with information on the unfavourable state of the country where the impact of climate change is still taking place.
This is part of the reason why we have decided to join this great move -- to go through the world and appeal to the world's leading personalities to present a just, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not an easy task, but it's necessary to do it, you can't keep avoiding it.
The police prevented protestors from approaching the center of Bella and indicated that she had kept 19 people in first place because they had a mask or had a caps.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during the demonstration.
According to one of the unaccompanied monsters who are not yet identified because they are involved in climate dialogues, active masking as athletes and in black clothing have put a number of deposits near the Kodana main channel, which is close to several ministries.
They were active in the buildings, he said, they were lighting the lights, but then they followed "a few big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the afternoon walk.
But the protest probably did not lead to the knowledge of key officials, such as Su Weie, the main Chinese climate leader.
When asked whether the demonstration had a constructive impact on international conduct, he replied "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of" (it is actually something I do not know).
Then he went on in the kitchen and said, "Because it's so broad, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed whether the departure was painful or helpful depending on the views of everyone.
It is to see the focus of the broad public and the various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words, "It can also be said that it is a violation of the conduct or freedom of others.
Test data removed persistent racial differences
Federal testimony from last week on acquired knowledge from mathematics was the first welcome news on the public school in Colombia.
Although the range remains far behind the high-performance systems of the country, the witness has shown greater progress in the fourth and eighth classes in the last two years than in the cities, including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest numbers of the National Certificate Centre for Progress in the study is the persistent differences in the knowledge gained between Africans and white students, both locally and on the national side.
In the last two years, the average result of the white casts of the fourth class of Colombia has increased from 267 to 270 points (of some 500), but in their African species, only three points, from 209 to 212.
The gap in the knowledge gained has indeed increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 points to 57 points.
Progress in the Afro-Americans in the eighth class remains essentially balanced, with a discount on statistics of one point from 245 to 245.
The mean result was not included in the results of the test because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture in the horizon for six years is not just exciting.
The difference between the white and black requirements of the fourth grade in 2003 when the first NEP was conducted in the course of the course was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved in children in both groups have improved during this period, the difference has increased to 58.
Some academic advocates in the course of the last week said that the results celebrated by the secretaries Michele A. Rhee and the elderly Adrian M. Fenty (D) were encouraged by the white students where they had already had high results.
This would say that we have increased their support to the highest end of the scale, which is problematic and worrying, said Jeff Smith, Executive Director D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality of teaching in the class.
I don't jump up and down because of the two or three points issue, said D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large) member of the Committee, who has a daughter in the fourth elementary school in Eaton.
Often critical of Mrs. Rhee's management style, Mrs. Brown said that reporting on the results of the test means secondary school in the city is in a desperate state and requires attention.
It's obvious that you always want to see the tapes, and I respect them.
But it's scary that we didn't know almost any time and energy that needed to be paid to our high school.
Ms. Rhee said that the efforts of the Committee were to continue to seek ways to improve the needs of students with low results.
In this regard, for example, some teachers in the use of new textbooks, Wilson's system of reading, aimed at students of higher levels of basic schools and high school students who were unable to manage the basics of reading in their careers, are significantly behind their peers.
The daily mathematics and the basis for the education of mathematics into the sixth class, highlighting games and experiences of real life that have been achieved in the course of the former director Clifford Janeyi, can be attributed to the course of the NAEP, which was reported last week.
And I just think we should go on working and do the best jobs in those students who remain below the level level, Mrs. Rhee said.
Others pointed out that the results of the NAP explained the question whether Ms Rhee could continue to improve the overall performance of the system and continue to provide further money and resources for low-performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It is a certain prized dilemma Mrs. Michel Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor at the California University in Berkeley where he studies the results of tests in urban areas.
The conventional adjustment procedure is to focus resources and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of Colombia.
Thus, the aim can be to bring political appeals directed against an important agency.
But the exit also belongs to other city leaders who are trying to maintain the average distance between the white and the black.
We need to focus on building a system of big schools.
We need to use our schools to ensure that all families, regardless of where they live, can rely on their children to provide excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, now head of the school in Newark, pointed out in the interview this week that the main factor in reducing the gap between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in the course to ensure that school justice is achieved.
You have to get up to 200 days so you can make changes, said Mr. Janey, who concluded a contract with his Lone Teachers Association for a school year of 185 days, which provides for a "right" to look for a larger increase in the coming year.
Make higher education a part of a better future
The train bus went to the Gettysburg Railway with a loud rehearsal.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, emerged and immediately started on white boots, brick façades and dark green trouts..
Gracielin's parents were in charge of high school in El Salvador.
So far, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never entered the bottom of the train.
Now she and the other eight classes in the group were studying Gettysburg, where the school was doing $38690 a year, their establishment was more than threatening visitors to raise potential students.
That's it! she chose Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the director offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Gentlemen, really? the rules of thought when they're exposed to a low level of professors to students.
The Pennsylvania train was one of the seven who visited their class trip and were now completely occupied with the future report: The question is, if you will enter the train.
The question is where.
However, this is a pressing problem concerning the high number of children born in the United States of Spanish immigrants who are expelled from high school or living as refugees, but statistics exist for those who will receive further education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, the fifth of these "two generations" of Spanish bicycles - remarkable results show that many of their immigrant parents, most Mexicans and Central Americans, have reached the United States without completing high school.
Their history of success is important, researchers point out, because it reinforces their point of view for generations that have played a crucial role in the field of labour forces in the country.
Those who have achieved high school education say that they had a natural tendency to go to school and a natural tendency to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and sought ways to compensate for the lack of knowledge of American schools.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciela and millions of children who would like to pursue a course - especially if these efforts are in time.
In view of the fact that children come from low income groups whose parents have no experience and ability to help them in the system, whatever simple principles in each individual point, says Patricia Gándara, a research institute at the California University in Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American field.
We need to think about providing these children with an accessible network in the pre-school age in all ways to attend high school.
The federal program, which financed Graciely's trip by train, is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million annually for local school systems to launch further preparatory programs, which start for students from small groups of middle schools and continue until these students finish high school.
Since 1999, this programme has served more than 10 million students, with more than a percentage of whom have enrolled, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Industry has reached agreement with 10 foreign mining companies
In spite of the concern about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to accept significant theft companies for the reconstruction of its cheap infrastructure during the two auctions that took place on Saturday.
The Ten Agreement concluded the Iraqi Ministry of the Red Industry with foreign Red Crescent Companies, indicating that Chinese, Russian and European Red Crescent companies are ready to play a significant role in the restoration of the Iraqi Red Crescent Industry, the decades of war and sanctions.
The American companies went with the capital interest just on two of the 10 fields exported.
Seven American companies paid for the second auction, which started on Friday.
She only submitted a lost offer.
Two American companies reached an agreement on the field that was drawn in June.
The dark part of the American rob giants in an open Iraqi robin industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war and the place of American companies here you have in the first row on the way to Asia and Europe, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, online reporting.
It'll be a long time before something else is sold in Iraq.
The security concerns raised by massive bombings in the afternoon and political instability, as well as the arrest of American armies, are likely to reflect American companies more intensively in Iraq, which have probably third largest source reserves, say analysts.
In some cases, American companies have been in crisis, in particular Chinese and other governments controlled by energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk because they do not correspond to shareholders.
Exxon Mobile and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that concluded agreements with the ministry.
Former American companies, such as Chevron and ConcoPhilippis, who maintained close contacts with the Iraqi Ministry of Industry and offered technical assistance in recent years, left empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts that were awarded at the end of this week.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp. participated in tenders for more contracts than all other companies and went with large shares in contracts in two main fields.
We all know that China is strengthening this state of the main economic, as well as technological strength, says Assam Jihad's speech ministry.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be comparably competitive and meet its commitments to Iraq.
The companies which were selected in advance to submit tenders were then compared to the barl price ministry and the ministry was willing to pay for the strengthening of the output above the current level in each field.
The planner al-Qaedy was apparently killed in Pakistan.
In the case of American rockets at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, it was evident that a specic planner of al-Qaedy operations was killed, as reported in the fifth U.S. anti-terrorist department.
As confirmed, it could be the second deadly attack on one of the highest terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when several rockets hit their fourth train near Miran Şah in the province of North Vaziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
The local authorities announced that the rockets were fired from the plane without a crew of the type with which the CIA operates in the sand of illegal domestic mines.
They were mentioned on a white car that led to the Afghan border when it was invaded, the officer introduced the Pakistanan intelligence agency he called from Miran Shah.
The officer said that the local armed forces had come to the point and quickly enjoyed what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies".
The local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victim, but two U.S. anti-terrorist officers quoted an unnamed witness who said that Somalia was after death.
Somalia was established as a highly established planner for military operations in al-Qaedy, which led the operations of a group of terrorists outside the Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in rehabilitating around the world, said a senior officer who had not yet been appointed, who had introduced a sensitive attitude of American aircraft officers on Pakistan's territory.
If he remained such a central position, he would probably have been involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He was instructed by the highest leadership of Al-Qaedy and planned a possible terrorist attack on the basis of them.
Another U.S. official said Somalia was rapidly in Al-Qaedy's hierarchy and was well connected to the other extremist groups in the region.
He didn't have to be a well-known person for some Americans, but he didn't let himself down in any way to see us and our associates, said another officer.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second highly established leader of al-Qaedy or Taliban who would have been killed since September when he was killed at the same time by the Maimudin Jalolov, the leader of the military group in the tribe of native tribes and three other high-ranking popperative leaders.
The time of attacks launched by the CIA by pilot-free aircraft has decreased from years of average operations of about six operations per month to two, according to Long War data records, the website of the non-ship group.
The reduction may be justified in the improved tactics of terrorist groups who have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also killing persons suspected of being informers.
The Supreme Delegation of the United Nations has left Kabul.
The High Representative of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, announced on Friday that he would like to leave his post in March and end such a heated functional period that was charged with a massive corruption in the election of the President of Afghanistan, supported by the UN.
Eide is leaving because Obama's administration decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN delegation stated that it supported growth, but expressed concern that the United States' timetable for reducing the state, which began in 18 months, should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO states to take their powers.
We need to speed up the construction of Afghan security forces and send the correct signal to the Afghans that they have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
An acceptable commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed on the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civil servants involved in the political transition to Afghanistan.
The rise on the side of armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, he said.
Eide said he didn't break up, but he just made a promise to his family in March 2008 that he spent only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the UN.
General Secretary Ban Ki-moon has now indicated that he would need time to find a reward.
As I said, it's the best time to look after the successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to the U.S. officials, the U.S. Ban started looking for revenge.
The officials indicated that it was decided between Stefan di Misturo, who had a Swedish-Italian origin and previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jeane-Maria Guéhenn, France, which had previously led the peace operation of the UN.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused of serving President Hamid Karzáí, who won in the country presidential elections from masking the presence of massive volunteer machinery.
Eide refuted this claim, but pointed out that Galgraitha's charge -- which was released -- "was definitely damaged by the mission, because there was a high level of scope with regard to international principles" in the election.
Eide indicated that he proposed a meeting with the highest representative of the population due to the coordination of the decommissioning effort to lead the US forces in Afghanistan.
He also called for the leadership of the UN to enable its members to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries who would borrow them for the Afghan mission, because he would like to strengthen their confidence that their money is needed properly.
Eide expressed disappointment over the limitation of its efforts in Afghanistan and pointed out that the difficult UN procurement regulation is undermining its capacity to use.
The rules of the UN are such that I had a chance to get from flowers only one person, he said.
It's a disaster and I can't continue.
Gates: Iran faces another sanctions
Defence Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world's powers will soon pass on to Iran "more significant sanctions" because of lack of involvement in the discussions on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq during a week's journey through the areas where they fought in Afghanistan and Iraq, were battled by the examples of armed acts against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good vote for Iran, he said in response to a military question about potential development.
One of the things that depends on me is whether I learned something from Iraq in the last six years, [it] is an inexhaustible inadmissibility in war.
The administration of both of them decides in the package of sanctions which could affect the Iranian military and political elite, but Gates indicated that some of these sanctions could also reach normal Iran.
He said that "the package of offer and arrest" would require "to accept the Iranian government to actually feel less secure with nuclear weapons", because "their citizens will suffer too much" sanctions.
According to a federal opinion issued by the White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has appointed a European leader to warn that Iran will have serious consequences if it does not introduce its nuclear programme in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its supervisory authority, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists on developing its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
In the discussions in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks on limiting his nuclear programme and agreed that he would provide a substantial portion of his own resources of the contaminated uranium exchange as an immediate fuel for the reactor for medical research.
The Administrative Board established an agreement as a way to build confidence between the two parties and to allow time for consultation.
But from that time on, Iran seems to withdraw from temporary agreements - partly because of the fact that the expert is divided into the views of the Iranian leadership on whether to engage in the United States.
It was pointed out that, as regards Iran's resistance to the international community in the case of some of the proposals that it actually agreed with at the beginning of October, I believe that this has led the international community, including Russia and the Chinese, along the road, which is not the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set a deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to proposals before returning to the search for other elections, including follow-up, which Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degrading sanctions".
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the UN condemned what it called "unrepresented and unsubmitted charges" to certain members of the Security Committee on Iran's nuclear activities and indicated that it would want to continue in discussions with the United States and five other world powers "in order to achieve an appropriate long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before flying into Kurdistan, rich in clothing to meet soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish representatives in Irbil.
It maintains high tension between Kurdy and the Iraqi majority, especially due to borders, ownership rights and distribution of income.
The Gtes pointed out on both sides to reduce the potential for conflict in order to prevent the maintenance of US plans to limit the number of US soldiers from 115000 to 50000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to relieve Kurdish anxiety from persistent depression. The U.S. official places quoted Gates when he sent Massoud Barzaaní, President of the Kurdistan regional government, saying: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In aging China, change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propagandaistic posters on which they read that "The Mother of the Earth is too exhausted to enjoy more children" and "One more child means one more grave."
Then they learned that when the official government office in Shanghai, alarmed by low births and ageing populations in their city, this year the course changed and began to encourage young couples, their reactions were immediate and resolved: Never.
We've always devoted all our time and energy to just one child.
We left nothing for the second one, says 31-year-old Wang, manager of human resources, who has a son of eight months.
For more than 30 years, the ongoing policy of China to have only one child was introduced and it has created two generations only of notoriety-bubellet and sucked children, who have been actively threatened by the “small sugar” crisis.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple in comparison to six before the policy entered into force, according to UN data.
The distribution of the population, where the population is aged 60 years and above, is expected to rise from 16.7 per cent in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This is far above the average of around 20 per cent.
The difference is greater in the rich coastal cities with high-school education, for example in Shanghai.
Loni people aged 60 and above created almost 22 percent of registered citizens in Shanghai, while births were less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission for Population and Family Planning, said many couples must have children to "help reduce the proportions of the elderly population and reduce the number of working forces in the future".
He says it's "to be old, it doesn't mean to be rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden."
Steps to calm down
As put into the constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese policy of one child is probably today the most controversial mandate of the Communist Party.
The two who broke the policy led to an inconsistencies -- up to their three-fold annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China's official offices have implemented a policy that has helped the country prevent critical freezing of natural resources, while human rights defenders have been rejected in policy enforcement.
In foreign areas, some officials forced pregnant women to give birth to their second child.
In addition, many couples had to undergo sessistically election losses, leading to an unexplained high level of male violence against women.
In recent years, public officials have been progressively more concerned with the policy of one child.
In 2004 the rules allowed the rise of exceptions - including the citizens of the city, the members of the national minority and cases when men and women were single - and in 2007 the thickest cuts of their hair, with strong lines.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor of popular research at Beijing University, said the central government officials had already discussed radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children, if one of the partners was a single partner.
In June Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign for the promotion of more offspring.
Nearly during the night, payments were made by parents to have only one child, replaced by copies of the regulation, detailing how to have another child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration sent family planning officers and volunteers to meet with the couple in their homes and to enter the airport.
They also made a commitment to provide civic and financial advice for those who decided to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, the family planning officers indicated.
A Closer Response
Although officials in one foreign town around Shanghai indicated an increase in interest in the couple who wanted to have a second child after the campaign began, most of the city districts did not report changes.
The city district of Huinan with a population of 115000, for example, still recorded four to five cases a month.
The complainants in Shanghai stated that despite the campaign, the number of people born in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Family Planning Committee in Shanghai, Caolu stated that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people don't want to have more children.
They want to give it to the best of the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said she would like to have two children and be legally allowed.
But like many Chinese who have only insufficient health and health insurance provided by the government.
Without a target detection network, the election could be irresponsible.
People in the West view the policy of one child badly as a controversial legal issue, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is in the seventh month of pregnancy in a relationship with the first child.
Yes, we've been eager to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
It's about money.
Other couples point out psychological reasons for behavior.
Wang, manager of human resources, says they want only one child, because she was also the only one: "We were the center of our family's attention and we were all worried about us.
We weren't used to provide care, and we didn't really want to worry about another.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who is a government translator company, expressed it much more indisputable.
For two-year-olds from middle-class families who have reduced their birth rate, he said to be successful means to be selfish.
Today’s 20 - and 30 - year - olds observe parents as having spent the first days of the Chinese experiment with capitalism and do not want this way of living for themselves, she says.
Just one child sets enormous demands for parental time, she says.
The mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are still controversial questions about space -- "You have to stop your stay" -- and the strategy -- "You have to have a summary prepared at a time when the child is 9 months for good pre-school education.
Most of his friends want to make peace with one child, says Che, but not with two.
We're the first generation with higher living standards, she says.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
The UN Group has developed a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN sponsored climate conference -- characterized by a far-reaching presence and mutual sympathy -- again on Friday focused on the release of a document that proposes an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gas emissions over the next 40 years with industrialized nations, most of which are most of the most vulnerable in the near future.
The text that can provide the exit for the final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions underlines the remaining obstacles as it explains the way forward.
But it was seen that significant progress was seen in the meetings that took place in the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Kodana next week.
Created by the OSN working group ad hoc, this text does not necessarily indicate how much money the rich country should provide to those poor to arrange with global short-term and long-term heating.
And it provides a whole range of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies so that they can limit their carbon output and what should be the upper limit to the growth of global warming that policy makers are still able to tolerate.
This adds a high dose of flexibility, says John Coequyt, top representative of the Washington Club Sierra.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed a six-star document, a summary of 180 pages of the text from the meeting for focusing on what the Spike Commissioner on climate issues at the UN, Yvo de Boer, described as "a big picture".
It sets out the figures for possible agreements in which industrial nations could jointly limit their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent per year compared with 1990 levels, while the main developing countries could reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent during this period.
The country would jointly reduce emissions by 2050 between 50 and 95 per cent.
The European Union made an urgent commitment to provide $3.6 billion in the next three years to help the poorest countries adopt adaptations to climate change -- from the management of floods and droughts to the ban on disposal.
Still, on Friday, he introduced the type of verbatim fires that were carried during the talks last week.
The US Special Envoy for Climate Issues Todd Stern rejected the statement requiring binding restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries compared with the prosperity of the major developing economies, if not funded by the developed world.
Posun signaled that Obama's administration had developed a tough line against China without Bush's administrative officers just two years ago.
The United States does not enter into a contract without the transfer of major developing countries and the implementation of the action, said Stern, who also claimed that the text was not sufficient to ensure limitations and should be checked by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs He Yafei told the US Prime Minister on climate issues that either the lack of "serious understanding" or "immortal incompetence" had led to a week earlier to the announcement that the United States would not help financially in China to cope with global warming.
With the future of the economic drive of the world's major forces in the chain, the facilities have been broken into both within the developing world and between the industrial world and the developing economies.
The current war is mostly about the preservation of individual economies rather than the preservation of the planets, between China and the United States as regards the fulfilment of their respective commitments, while the poorest nations warn that two tenths of the world's most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives of greater action.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegation, said that it is not surprising that the main forces are fighting against those who should bring costs to limit greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in looking for ways to prevent large issuers from taking responsibility for their actions.
It is clear that the new economic hegemony is developing, Ulate said, which also serves as regional advice in the region of regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for the international protection of nature.
Some of the countries that are most vulnerable to climate change have indicated that they would want to continue to implement legally binding agreements in Kodana, but most of the main participants said that the best outcome of the discussions would be the political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, has created a 24-star proposal for an agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Mitzger, who led the international climate conference in favour of the European Commission, said that the move by the small island nations "recalled political pressure on the whole policy process" partly because they are now united and demand actions from growing economies, such as China and India.
The meeting created a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining controversial issues before the heads of government reached an agreement.
High positions of officials, such as the Indian Minister for the Protection of the Environment Jairam Rames and the Chinese Deputy Minister of Health, came from the plane and passed through the center of Bella to the closed door of meetings and new conferences, so they could draw up orders that would be assessed next week.
The simple scope of the assembly - when 13,000 people moved from and to the Congress Centre every day, the guitars playing the role of the players were staged on the ironing night of the countries they thought they had sent, and came to hand-made proposals on paper rather than electronic mail -- controlled output.
Intensity is only the rule: in Kodana, almost all key ministers were present and early in the middle of 60 heads of state.
We got into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the Deputy Minister for Global Policy in the International Protection of Nature.
They're coming with heavy burdens.
British first train with speed 140 miles per hour defined this afternoon feeling
at 5:13 a.m., the star fell dark on the sign of the train departure, which meant the revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach a speed of 140 miles per hour and flight from Ashford to Kent in London's St Pancras and exceed 58 miles per 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmes and entered the first high-speed personal settlement outside lLndýn.
It is hoped that the new service will eventually connect Britain with the international network of fast, reliable trains and connect great agglomerations to Midland, north and Scotland with London.
The above-mentioned waters should reduce transport times in personal transport and on commercial routes and transit from aircraft and cars on the railways could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate traffic jams.
Theoretically, the three main political parties were allowed to gain this vision.
But the tens of billions of buildings free of charge needed to build a new national railway network, an inevitable battle on projects and concerns about environmental degradation have now led to the construction of British high-speed roads.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a realistic study, transmitted its message to Lord Adonis for 30 December, as stated by Times.
She provided him with a detailed map of another planned high speed network.
The new link between London and Western Midland was proposed to be five metres in urban areas and fours where it could be challenging to add to the environment.
It was planned in an open area up to 25 metres of finish track.
HS2 also proposes to specify three choices for a wide high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will respond to the fire.
The preferred choice is to confiscate the form of Y letters when one high-speed track should lead to western Midland.
The trail should be divided close to Birmingham with one wind passing from Pennsylvania to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading north to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One trail should take you to Scotland.
"It looks like it's come to the most powerful election," said the trainer.
As soon as it's finished, the driving hours between London and Edinburgh will be between two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be opened before 2025, could allow traveling between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to more than one hour in the presence.
The proposals should allow trainers to travel at 2250 miles per hour, which would make from the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial route is already proposed to unload trains in 400 m , which would be capable of transporting 1100 persons.
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on London-Birmingham trail.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers per hour if necessary.
In view of the capital limitation, it is assumed that the existing station would be expanded to accommodate a high-speed network.
Railway industry experts claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offers such potential.
Lord Adonis will notice whether he intends or fails to implement this scheme, but broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not come before the general elections.
Even if the car is moving, the network should be built on parts.
Trains should be first introduced, not on high-speed tracks, but already existing trails north of Birmingham and maintain travel times between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This is attributed to a decisive point for ensuring the transition from aircraft to trains, a point for the revolution to the railway.
The taxpayers won the mortgage at 75000 pounds on Tory's orange
Alan Duncan, held the previous headquarters of Tory in the parliamentary record, paid thousands of free of charge for the last year for the orange that he had built in his own house in a voluntary service.
the talking party behind the prison, who was degraded by David Cameron because he complained that the messengers lived "from the provinces", increased his mortgage to 75000 pounds to build a deep-sea expansion in his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to take into account special interest, a total of free per month for taxpayers.
The general authorities accepted orders at the time and thus was not heard by Sir Thomassen Legge, who was conducting the control of member expenditure. Last night Mr. Duncan said his demands "maybe cleaner or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, owns two double houses for everyone in his optional forums Rutland and Melton.
Homes are worth about a million pounds.
There is a kitchen, living room and food in the country, but the financial authority agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year he added to the house of the winter garden, which is marked in plans as orange.
Neighbors describe it as a "snake for fun and hospitality".
Mr Duncan was not asked to provide an explanation for the increased loan during the last control of the Committee on General Standards and the opportunity to finalize the mortgage.
The Committee has told him last month that he has broken the rules after reviewing his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the populace security to the mortgage in height of 271406 from his property in London to his own house in his voluntary occupation, which he purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a member of the parliamentary parliament.
The documents released this week showed that Mr. Duncan hired about 1400 pounds a month in the interest of the mortgage until March of the year.
In depth, his orders increased to more than 1800 pounds per month.
The interest of RBS in Mr. Duncan's mortgage could not be altered at this time, which means that all of this was intended to finance the loan of 75000 pounds.
The standard variable RBS payment of mortgages decreased by 7.94 per cent in December 2007 by 4 per cent in March of this year, during which it remained.
The last document of the general authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to hire 1250 pounds per month in May.
Mr. Duncan gave up his job as a stone manager of the House in September, after a secret record of her film and said that she had to live "on the floor" after the scandal with the expense.
"In principle, it's natural, you have to live on the floor and behave with you like s**t."
He said, "I've lost money for my garden and profit and a small share of what was needed.
And I could steal the whole damn part, but I can't do it."
The messenger, a millionaire from the former career as a rope dealer, was first invited to explain his issue in May when it was shown that he hired thousands of pounds for his prize, even before the approval of the financial authority, that "may be considered excessive".
One of the activists dug a pit in the form of a librarian sign in Mr. Duncan's shop for a protest after which it turned out that he had stolen 4,000 pounds for three years.
When he was asked to raise the mortgage last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was because of raising capital, which was approved as a financial agency, and then Leggem."
He added: "This is not a controversial question of hiding and calling or breaking the rules or anything else.
It's absolutely equal to the face down, according to rules, right and that's all.
It would not be easy to be in many other ways cleaner or simpler."
Come, everyone, carefully look at the chat on the bright coast with the adventurous calendar.
Coastal chats in Brighton have found new meanings of life in winter months as an interactive adventure calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that promotes the religious use of creativity, called for 24 owners to issue their chats every day in the afternoon and to use the Christmas bicycles as the theme of this exhibition.
The event began on 1 December when it allowed visitors to check the last chat from 17.30 to 18.30 a day, and the biscuits and broken wines provided free.
Selected channels included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas, when the chat presented the work of Janet Tozer, local art.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a television marketing assistant from Hove, is a priest without scholarship in the Chichester diocese and leading Beyondu.
He said: "We want to make worship much more important for people in post-Christian society.
"Why do we have to expect people to come to another old building as a church? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in an exciting way.
"The idea of an adventure calendar in chats has just given rise to conversation with some friends during the evening.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and pulsating place and we have tried and presented this spiritual path."
Strong mobilization in Kodana and in the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people went to the street on Saturday with a demand for a decent and binding agreement against global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Kodana, demonstrated around the world and in Kodana where the police arrested hundreds of people at that time.
At least thirty thousand people according to police sources and one hundred thousand according to organizers showed in the cold season in the Danish capital at the time of the UN Climate Conference, whose aim is to enter into a five-year agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the Climate Conference, stated that the growing global mobilization, which is clearly a modern manifestation, contributed to the "political tax" of the eventual failure in Kodana.
According to the AFP newspaper, the incident in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the beginning of the process, when a group of about 300 demonstrators dressed in black began to break out of the exhibitions with long-distance bones and clubs.
The order police got very busy right away.
The entire police announced 600 to 700 arrests and confirmed that the members of the Blacks Blocks were particularly involved in the ultra-racial private groups that had already appeared in depth at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
Koalice Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the action, condemned the conditions for which hundreds of radicals were arrested "without distinction" and stressed that probably hundreds of them were in the trenches and in the seat "kept in the streets still on Saturday evening" and even in extreme winter.
After the leave of Parliament, the tour was smoothed out to Bella Center, where she was conducting the meeting.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to cross the inside.
For the speakers, a podium was set up, before which a spiritual meeting was held at the candles for the participation of the former South African Archbishop of the Cape Town of Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protestors received a bus and train from major European cities, and besides Africans, there were also a large number of Asian participants, including some Chinese and Korean.
About 3,000 people dressed mostly in blue beaches created the first meeting in Kodana in the afternoon, and this was called by a group of Friends of the Earth, who wanted to create a "moderate wave" for "righteous climate".
Today, we go to the street to ask for a balance of environmental debt in the south, explained the people of Nacpil, Philippines's army from the Jubilee South Coalition in Kodani.
We can't say that it's time for this to happen, the Beninan singer Angelique Kidjoo.
In Africa rivers and rivers are flowing, we can go to them today, and it was never possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 by the adoption of the UN Treaty, the struggle for a different world has drawn closer to environmental organizations.
The French European Ambassador José Bové, one of the world's leaders, said that he had come to Kodan with the aim of "climate and social justice". "There is no difference at present between the fight against global warming and the fight against another world."
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Techoma region, in which many islands are especially sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, about 50,000 people have gone to the street according to organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, were dressed in red clothes and with rising energy rates.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundreds of protesters have gone to the streets with a demand for a strong response to climate change.
In France, protests organized by "350" were attended by hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseilles (theirs), Lille (the north), Bordeaux (the west) and Lyon (the east).
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia chose its president, Gruzie dismisses it as "frequency"
Abkhazia elected her president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist territory as independent of Georgia, Tbilisi is still reporting this step for "fresque".
About 131,000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russian-Gruzin war in August 2008 on control over the South Ossetia, which is another former Georgian territory known as Russia.
The spare rooms were closed at 17 hours of GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhaz Volunteer Commission, 58% attended the meeting hours before the closure of the premises.
The first preliminary results should be reported at night from Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including the President-in-Office Sergey Bagapša, categorically reject the opinion of the agreement with Georgia, which condemned these elections.
These wills are frescoes.
On the other hand, Georgian President Michael Saakašvili "is afraid that Abkhazia has fallen completely into Russian rule," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgalze.
In addition, Russia recognized the independence of this territory with only 216 000 citizens of Nicaragua and Venezuela, while the rest of the world considered it to be part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by the Russian army.
After division from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict, with several thousand people, Abkhazia is trying to show through the election that it is ready to return to international policy.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, a new era of our independent state, said AFP Quarčia Lightlan, a 54-year-old historian who also acknowledged that she voted for President Bagapše.
She was one of those who came to volunteer to volunteer in the school in Suchumi capital, to a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is the main theme of presidential elections in this region on the Black Sea coast, which can be proud of the beautiful nature.
Throughout this small country with 216,000 inhabitants, huge billboards were set up with Bagapše in front of Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putina.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials, who had come to watch the wall during the elections, waited for a warm reception from the district of Beslan Aršby.
"We, Abkhaz, are grateful," he said in a small order, with a view to supporting Moscow and in particular her decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations Organization, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, said and added to it a key guide.
The opposition, represented in the elections by former vice-president Raul Khadzhimbou and two merchants Zausem Ardzinbou and Beslan Boutbou, criticized contracts concluded in the last year with Moscow, such as the contract allowing Russia to control the Abkhazia railway network for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support neither the current government nor opposition.
To win in the elections, an excess of 50% plus one vote is required.
If none of the candidates fail to achieve this result, the ruling file must end in two weeks.
Climate: World demonstration, events in Kodani
Tens of thousands of people went to the street on Saturday with a demand for a decent and binding agreement against global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Kodani, was demonstrated worldwide and in Kodana, where about 700 people were arrested by the police on that occasion.
At least thirty thousand people according to police sources and one hundred thousand according to organizers showed on the afternoon in the main Danish city, which will be hosted by 18 December by a delegation from 193 countries, which could enter into an agreement on 1 January 2013.
After the leave of Parliament, the tour was smoothed out to Bella Center, where she was conducting the meeting.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to cross the inside.
For the speakers, a podium was set up, before which a spiritual meeting was held at the candles for the participation of the former South African Archbishop of the Cape Town of Desmond Tutu.
According to the AFP newspaper, the incident soon after the departure, when a group of several hundred demonstrators, dressed in black and armed cyclists and clubs, began to explode.
The order police suddenly broke down and broke down without waiting, and several demonstrators broke into the ground.
The entire police announced 600 to 700 arrests and confirmed that the members of the Blacks Blocks were particularly involved in the ultra-racial private groups that had already appeared in depth at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
On the afternoon afternoon, one police officer was injured in the back of his body and four cars were burned near the Squat near the incident near the scene, which was due to the police resources of about 20 people.
We're focusing on the extremist group, protecting the speech police, Henrik Jacobsen, while the air is back in the air.
Most of the protestors who received a bus or train from large German cities from London, Amsterdam and Milan were European origins.
But there were also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
About 3,000 people dressed mostly in blue beaches created in the afternoons in Kodana the first meeting on the call of a group of Friends of the Earth who wanted to create a "moderate wave" for a "righteous climate".
Today, we go to the street to ask for a balance of environmental debt in the south, explained the people of Nacpil, Philippines's army from the Jubilee South Coalition in Kodani.

The French European Ambassador José Bové, one of the world's leaders, said that he had come to Kodan with the aim of "climate and social justice". "There is no difference at present between the fight against global warming and the fight against another world."
The Oxfam organisation has called for a number of famous personalities, such as the Danish model Helen Christensen or former UN Commissioner for Victims of Mary Robinson to talk to the tax.
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Techoma region, in which many islands are especially sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, about 50,000 people have gone to the street according to organizers.
In Manila, before the Philippines’s capital office, several hundred people, mostly students in red clothes and with signs of the rising importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, several hundred demonstrators also met with a demand for a significant measure against climate change.
In France, protests organized by "350" were attended by hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseilles (theirs), Lille (the north), Bordeaux (the west) and Lyon (the east).
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
Subjects of the map and legislation will be strengthened in the context of the reform of the general gymnia, Chatel said.
The Minister of Education Luc Chatel pointed out during the Sunday talk for JDD magazine that the subjects of the newspaper and the country will be in the context of the reform of the general "skilled" profession, although their research will no longer be based on accurate knowledge in the last year of the gymnasium.
Now all students of the second year will have four hours a week and for all, the same program from public culture will be confirmed by Chatel.
According to the Minister, "it must be done with covertness", because he says specialization S is no longer focused on accurate knowledge" but "there are basically the best students in it".
The specialisation of the EU and L cannot be for any sub-specialisations, it continues and stresses: "I have heard many stories and intellectuals who would insist that in the last year of professional gymnasiums, the country and the event will not be taught."
An investigation by the Ifop agency, which published the Humanities newspaper on Saturday, showed that seven of the 10 (69%) French people did not agree with the government's project to cancel the compulsory education of the book and the country in the school year with specialization S, and that is why many intellectuals and teachers criticized this cancellation as both the left and some Members of the right.
On the other hand, the Minister added that "does not take into account" to delete the philosophy in the specialization programme of the master journal S.
At the same time, Luc Chatel defended the reform in teaching students, while 16 organisations (students and committees) were invited to participate in yesterday's mobilisation against this project, which according to them offered the educational education of future gymnasium teachers.
The Minister explained at the beginning of the annual trial focusing on their opinions and at the end of the year's further examination of their ability to learn.
Participating in professional courses during the second year of the Master's study and in the first year they will be presented as a professor-stationist before they wish.
If you count all the steps that will be offered to you before the reception procedure, you will gain more experience with requests, about 300 hours, continued .
The Minister also announced that he would propose "personal right to education", which is still not available in national education.
The project was reaffirmed by the destruction of school maps by 2012.
At the elite university of École, normal topiers have 15 minutes to convince them of the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the objectives of the Kodańsk Summit: this is the challenge he announced in the morning of Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Development Experts (GIEC) to the University of Ecole Normal Superiore on Ulm Street.
As one AFP journalist reported, the Nobel Prize Prize for Peace, Jean Jouzel, opened the first of the "Ernest" conference, which is a single seminar composed of fifteen-minute experts' contributions that will be presented and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would affect people and, on the basis of what they would like to know more, explained at the 22-year-old Edouard Hannez conference, one of the organizers of this seminar, which received the name of the local lake fishermen who called it the students.
About two-hundred-and-a-half of the experts participating in each of the scientific disciplines were selected and confirmed that the choice was based on their charisma.
About climate warming "we can talk about hours, but we can also keep the basic objectives in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke before a dozen listeners without any prepared notes, only using graphs.
It's part of our scientific work, he stressed with hope that the audience knew that "the Kodánic Conference is working on very seriously prepared scientific foundations".
The video on these presentations will be posted on the website of the school since December 15.
The next "Ernest" seminar is scheduled for the event and will be followed by the regularity every two months.
Delay in payments: suspension of surveillance in prisons, planned measures
The committee of prison inspectors announced on Friday "general mobilisation" because they requested that they be awarded the premiums and the amounts of time spent on ice for financial reasons.
The Federal FO (2nd Committee of Supervisors) requested employees who would not have the service to participate in demonstrations in the morning before the prison facilities and to "block" them and so warn of "the theft of their goods".
The CGT for prison surveillance (3rd Committees of this sector) called for "calling on meetings in individual prisons and starting the basic mobilisation" to be "suspendable and unacceptable", to "times and allowances for work in the night, Sundays and holidays" processed in October were not charged in December.
First Committees of Observers, Federal Union of Prison Observers (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for total mobilisation (...) with a view to expressing discontent and disillusionment".
The Governing Board and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of periods increased significantly in 2009 and not all were included in the financial budget, but ensures that the debt amounts will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Office indicated that Michèle Alliot-Mario had sent the committee of prison inspectors a communication guaranteeing that the payment would be made in the next month.
I know of the efforts the prison staff make to ensure the functioning and modernization of our prison system, writes in their communication.
I ordered the Prison Management Board to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation resulting from the poor assessment of the number of periods in the future, which has never recovered, has been accompanied by the Ministry of Alliot-Mario.
The Prosinc will therefore be low, with the exception of the managers who receive a famous award for the performance of the function and performance of the objectives, says Ufap/Uns, and for those "will always find a place in the budget".
It's just a scandal, the interregional FO Union in Marseille broke down and announced its decision to cancel "all meetings and calls".
Workers will not come to work on Sunday or on holidays if they are not paid for these days from October to December, as well as in due course, they are also threatened by FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
When we're given more work and more jobs without having other personnel available to us, it's sad to be allowed to pay you the lowest level of employees, says CGT prison inspectors in Bordeaux.
According to the committees, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better than others.
However, in each case of financial resources because little, General Secretary-General Ufap, Jean-François Forget found.
Obama claims that at Christmas he's giving "better gifts" than those he gets.
American President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first wedding with the family in the White House, believed the "warming" screens of Oprah Winfrey that regarding gifts, has a simple rule: "I give more gifts than those I get".
The president and his wife, Michelle, spoke in a special edition of the order that will be sent on Sunday evening to ABC Station on how to spend the holiday and the end of the year in their new and prestigious apartment.
Even Bo, a small four-year-old family member will get his own reward.
Jesus also likes Boa, said Michelle Obama, with the dog also "of course" gets a gift as it comes from the cuts from the pre-order.
And Michelle Obama also opposed her husband's claim on the quality of gifts, which she gets: "So I certainly didn't, I gave you a gift for a long time," the president lamented.
Well, of course it's true, he was forced to agree with the president, but immediately after the humor, he showed his finger on the hairdresser first lady, "And who gave you this?"
At this one-year-old very free order with the famous moderator, who actively supported Barak Obama in his presidential campaign, they also talked to Obama's wives about their favorite gifts that they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a bike with a 10-step conveyor, but also a basketball ball that he was wearing at his father's wedding, which he met with only a very short time.
I remember seeing my father, who came to see us for dinner and how he gave me the basketball ball, told the president.
It's been a long time since I realized that the sword actually gave me it.
The first lady mentioned the house for the girls again.
I didn't know how to organize it all in the house, so I fixed all the furniture on the wall instead of putting it around the floor, but I loved that little house for women, mentioned Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-infirmed, RTL says she's in an art bed
Johnny Hallyday was re-examined in Los Angeles because of the "s injury" resulting from the major operations he performed in France, but the situation is according to his closest "control", while the RTL station indicated that the song is in an art bed to prevent pain and complications.
The 66th-year-old rocker was re-patriated on Wednesday at the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors found "the injury resulting from the operation" of the contaminated plant that he carried out in Paris on November 26, he sent to Paris his press department, asking for "correct surgery".
However, the printing department tried to calm the public and indicated that the situation was "under control" and at the same time announced that a new medical communication would be issued no later than 48 hours later.
According to the RTL station, which is the main partner of the final tournament, Johnny Hallyday was placed in an artificial bed to prevent "pangs and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens our eyes, we'll have a little more security, it'll supply RTL.
The Press Division, on the question of AFP, did not confirm this information or comment.
RTL also states that according to "some sources" there was no such thing after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was charged at the Parc Monceau International Clinic for Explosive Plants.
The surgery that was planned a few days ago was performed by the neurosurgery of Stefan Delajoux, a well-known doctor in art circles.
But the doctor was not available on Thursday to express himself to the RTL information.
After this operation, the song of Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized on Monday at the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles for infection that occurred after surgery.
A song by Eddie Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallydaye, said on Thursday in the RTL radio that his friend is going through "a bad time", but added that he's about rocker "no care" because it's a big "warman".
He phoned me quietly before the flight to Los Angeles, but I told him he's making a fool, because spending 12 hours in the airport after such an operation is no fun, said Eddie Mitchell.
In the middle of the night, he calmed the situation of the singer, Jean-Claude Camus, who said that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well on antibiotics", and that the infection was "stopped".
Mr. Camus also said that he met Laeticia, his wife's singer, and that he had no special concerns.
Health problems only occur since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after fall on his bicycle.
Two months later, to the surprise of all, it was found that Johnny Hallyday was based on a "small tanker" and then on a weak infection.
At the end of the week, the music returned to its long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as its solution.
But since then every problem of his health has been very monitored and commented. Fanouss and journalists have noticed that the music has a problem with movement on the stage.
In mid-November, his team had to decompose the new hospitalization report again.
Euro-2009/small pool: Prime Minister Bousquet in his favorite discipline
Francouz Frédérick Bousquet, a three-year-old medalist at the 2009 World's Museum, won the title of the 2009 European Museum in a small pool in Istanbul in a discipline that is especially fond of: 50m free.
The first day of the mystery, on which the last allowed combinations, only three world records fell, even though they were expected to be much more.
One of them defeated Hungarian racer Evelyn Verrastov on the 200 m field race and two other Russian men's staff on the 4x50 m field race.
A great charm for Bousquet, which has made a world record for 50 m free way, already held in a large pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal disciplines, 50m free way, Francouz won 28 years of age with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, on which ten pilots started at the top of the usual eight.
Bousquet defeated Croatia Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergee Fesikov (20.84), but failed to convince him of the world record (20.30).
We can always dream of something better, but I said if there's a world record in my reach, I'll try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all the sailors had combinations made of polyurethane that would be banned from January 1.
From February 2008 to the 238 World Records and their era ended in Istanbul, which was the first host in 1999 on the same competition.
The use of combinations this time did not help the Germans of Paul Biedermann, the dual master of the world in a large pool in Rome, which had a world record on hand.
The young sailor was unable to cross a record that holds 400 meters free way (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), before Russian runner Nikitou Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Madsem Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't do everything to that race.
I knew I didn't break the world record this time, but I was able to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent of the future, explained Biedermann.
U.S.: The Roman Sarcopharynian ship corresponding to Zolov was sold for $1.5 million
The table of the Roman sarcophagus, which did not belong to anyone other than French writer Emil Zolov, was issued on Thursday for $1.5 million, which is clearly more than estimated, said a businessman with the art of Sotheby's.
The price of these two meters long and 63 cm high lead tablets, dating from the third century of our flight, was estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
Mramor "presenting four dionysian scenes in the developed architectural decoration, surrounded satyrs and babchants is a rare part of the world's very small, about four or five" AFP told Florent Heintz, Vice-President of the auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby's.
The deal was sold between hundreds of others.
The sale is still ongoing, but it's the subject that was most likely to be addressed by the AFP language agency Sotheby's, Dan Abernetthy.
The fact that Emile Zola managed this nightmare was discovered a few days ago.
Deska was about 300 years old in Rome in the late Borgia family collection and then gradually appeared in the French hierarchy of Cecile Sorelove, who had rented a van with her in her private hotel in Paris and at Paul Reynada, the Minister of the Third Republic in France and the President of the Council prior to the entry into force of Petaina.
It's been under arrest for about fifteen years.
Florent Heintz found in the search for a museum database in Louvru that this board was part of the "Emira Zoly's remains" opened since 1903, the year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and the fresh "Rougon-Macquaart".
A cancelled attempt to leave President Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico.
On Thursday, Mexico claimed that the conditions for the transport of the wounded President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, refused to provide a guarantee of safe exit.
After a phone call I had last night with President Zelaya, she still points out that there is no way to achieve this transport, the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinos.
The Mexican government aircraft which flew to the center of El Salvador for President Zelaya again introduced the source of the general migration management.
The clean-up government wanted to bring President Zelay to "demissions" and to ask for political asylum abroad, only to provide him with a safe exit.
But the Vice-President rejected these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as an exile head of state.
The U.S. government said on Thursday Zelaya radio Globe, which often refers to a political crisis that lasts for five months in this Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, I've got my guitar here, I've added a fresh president, hidden in the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalp, for two and a half months, and I've been playing a couple of accords.
Mexico's prime minister asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transport, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain asylum applications, said the Minister in the middle of the Prussian government, Oscar Raul Matute to the Honduran Radio HRN.
I'm not going to ask for asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya said in a talk for Telesur station, which has a seat in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will go as President of the Honduran people.
The report on the departure of Zelai was mobilized in the middle of the position of the concerned president, who came to gather around the vast island of Brazil, where the army strengthened the protection.
Brazil's Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticised the status of the punitive government.
They show their marginal status to international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who approached the Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez on 28 June, was arrested on the day he was organizing his re-election of public consultation and against the recommendation of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
Out of exile in Costa Rica he unexpectedly returned on 21 September and found refuge in the Brazilian capital.
If he gets out of here, he'll be arrested and he'll be responsible for the crime of "manage", which he's accused of, he'll be charged with being a police officer.
On 29 November, President Roberto Micheletti was able to organize presidential elections to replace President Zelaya.
In the controversial elections recognised by the United States but condemned by the countries of Latin America as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelaya's return to power, until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street is rising, US business balance is boosting optimism.
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday, and the results of the US business balance testify to the rise in both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones won 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final findings, Dow Jones Industrial Average has improved from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points and Nasdaq, with technological domination from 7,13 points to 2190.06 points.
Index Standard & Poor 500 improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from various parts of the economy, commented Lindsey Piegzva from FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focusing on "half of the full-scale".
For Peter Cardillo from Avalon Partners, investors focus mainly on the number of US trade balances, "which show that activity improves in the fourth quarter".
The U.S. business balance was estimated at 7.6% in October, at $32.9 billion.
Instead, the analysts expected the collapse of the castle.
There was an increase in both imports and exports.
The big news is the rising trade volume, especially the export of goods, which reflects the growth of the economies of the major trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell of the Research Company Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week, unemployment was rising against all expectations and the number of job applicants reached 474,000.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new employees is "at least in this year," said Scott Marcouiller from Wells Fargo Advisors.
A piece of valuable paper, too.
The amount of state savings by 10 years increased by 3,482% turnover by 3,423% on Tuesday evening and by 30 % increase by 4,492% turnover by 4,408% daily.
Cuba : hundreds of residents of the regime signed the White House
A number of hundreds of Cuban regime residents died on Thursday of political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of the World Day of Human Rights and stopped other demonstrations where dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About forty "Dam in White", married or close to political prisoners were posted directly on the street of the rest of the Raula Castra regime on their way to the city center, with a request for political prisoners to be released, the journalist reported.
Go away with Yankees!, "Golds!", "The Street belongs to revolutionists!", "Let Fidel and Raul live!" were complaining about the double-distance flag of the regime on the dissidents.
The dissidents were eventually escorted into civilians who accepted "safety."
The day before, there was a similar protest against the White Lady in Havana, but there was no harm or arrest.
But in the Huvan Square Vedado, police officers were detained in the civilian area, about ten dissidents, who also tried to protest on Thursday, on the occasion of the World Day of Human Rights, reported the AFP.
According to this newspaper, the police stationed dissidents who had been ordered by the government regime into civilian vehicles for the use of force.
The arrest of dissidents under similar conditions takes only a few hours.
Sacharov's prices for the European Parliament for 2005, the White Houses organised an unauthorized "demission of all, according to the decadent, about 200 political prisoners", said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda was sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Mr Maceda is one of the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the response to the "guarantee" or "agents" paid by their main enemy, the United States.
A complete surprise, Cuban television brought a report on the fourth demonstration of the rest of the government regime against "revolutionary protesters".
The Cuba with the Communist Party in the Heads of State and the Government's policy is regularly accused by European or American non-governmental organizations of non-compliance with human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
The knifeman killed an eight-year-old man and wounded five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A knife gunman killed an 18-year-old man and wounded five other people in Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) during the raids on Thursday afternoon.
According to the preliminary results of the investigation, a 28-year-old attacker reportedly attacked two knifes and, for unknown reasons, an eight-year-old man in or before him, on 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, is a version of the police and witnesses.
He was seriously injured by the old man, who was born in 1929, according to the police union Alliance in the hospital for the consequences of the injury.
In this medicine or before, the attacker attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
His wife was about thirty years old, and he started to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were taken to the same hospital where a man died at the age of 80.
The life of the second wounded is in danger, according to police sources, obviously important organs have been infected.
Then a pregnant woman ran away and was transferred to the hospital "in shock," said the police source.
An armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as he pointed out a police source, then fled to the street, still at Jean Jaurès' bulevard.
He wounded two others, apparently a man of thirty and forty years, of the second most serious.
It's not quite clear how this happened, because it's all played in the evenings.
He was armed with two scissors that carried the cross behind him, said at the location of the Alliance's leading union in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Presse.
Several roundabouts, including young people, have tried to stop and fight, according to the testimony of the assembled AFP.
I saw a 30-year-old guy in a green bunker.
Three young men tried to catch him.
It didn't happen to them because he was quite strong, commented on the situation of Alberto, a reader from a nearby bar.
He got paid, including one of the city police, who then broke down the record.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the 61 level, two police cities, including their leaders, tried to keep an armed man and were injured by the guns, introduced a police source.
The incident occurred in one of the main streets of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
They came to tell me that outside is an injured person.
I went out and saw a 17-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and I noticed a big wound on my chest, sent AFP Frederic Allion, a thirty-year-old doctor.
Five minutes later, another person, about thirty-three years old, who also had foot wounds, came in.
A man who had no evidence of authenticity was arrested after the state police.
The State Representative in Nanterre handed over the matter to the investigation department of the National Police Department in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The suspect was transferred to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in a fight and he's waiting for an interview.
The police source did not exclude his location in a psychiatric treatment.
Another police source indicated that six police officers needed his control at the police station in Clichy, where he was transferred.
He was "all beside himself" as "all the madnesss of this guy whose strength in action increases tenfold."
USA: Poland's lawyer again asks for the end of the criminal proceedings
The Polish-French director Romana Polanski again asked on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States) to stop the criminal proceedings against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence because of the dark case that occurred 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a legal representative of the director of the film "Pianist" criticised before three judges of the second-term appeal court in California, a serious error that occurred during a court hearing in 1977.
I'm asking you to stop touching right now and then, he introduced Justice Hummel and added that, from the conduct of the judge who was at the time of the case, Laurence Rittenband "had a hatred in the background".
According to him, the judge (who had died between that time) had evidently met with a state representative who told him that Roman Polanski was worthy of prison – which is a serious violation of the rule of law.
Information on this conversation appeared in the document "Roman Poland: wanted and desired" (Roman Poland, sought and requested), from the mouth of the national representative, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally announced at the end of the session that the author's "blaming" document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, Justice Hummel will request a court hearing in which he will be able to submit evidence of his claim.
The complainant repeated what had been said in the first state, although there was no serious study of the application for the cessation of criminal proceedings until Roman Poland was brought before the court.
A 76-year-old director graduated from the United States in 1978, before the court ruled on "unlawful sexual intercourse" with a 13-year-old girl.
Since then he has never entered the territory of the United States again.
The prosecutor's representative at Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said Roman Poland "should be there to participate in a court hearing".
In this case, we want to show not only Roman Poland, but also another unfortunately, that it is possible to escape? Mrs. Asayam is asked.
It is the opinion that the director "is seeking the favor of the court and at the same time betrays his authority."
One of the three judges who now have 90 days to make a decision also stressed that there are other options for exemption.
Justice Hummel wasn't the only one who asked to stop Roman Polanski's criminal prosecution.
The victim's legal presence, Samantha Gemer's again requested the end of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client continued to bear this constant burden every time the Polish case arises and added: "No one in this room can say that the trial was just."
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland at US command
After more than two months behind the grid, he was released into his prison in his castle in Gstaad, where he was waiting for a show.
Wall Street ends without direction, speeding up a dollar.
The New York borough ended on Friday without direction, the market is lost between indicators that were better than expected in the US and rising dollar price: Dow Jones got +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final conclusion, Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10,471,50 points and Nasdaq, leaving 0.55 points with technological domination and ending to 2,190.31 points.
Index Standard & Poor's 500 increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106,41 points.
Honestly, the market is very calm, introduced Mace Blacksilver from Marblehead Asset Management.
It's still in bad shape, the size of the trade has decreased very much, and I think it's going to stay until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected and which "helped to improve market governance in terms of stability of economic recovery," the analyst Charles Schwab said.
In the United States, the retail market grew by 1.3% in November, and it was already the second month after itself and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary survey of the index from the University of Michigan, the U.S. consumer confidence has also returned, and in December it grew to 73.4 against 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the index was stolen by a new increase in the price of the dollar against the euro, which is the highest in the last two months, which "attached the down direction of the sector sensitive to the economic situation," Owen Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank said.
Technological actions are thus losing ground under their feet.
A piece of precious paper was sealed.
The result of state savings by 10 years increased by 3,540% turnover by 3,482% in the middle of the evening and by 30 years by 4,497% turnover by 4,492% per day.
Volba Miss World again in the Republic of South Africa.
After a month's trip to the Republic of South Africa, 112 candidates on the title of Miss World are going to cross the goal of reaching their dream: to be chosen by the most beautiful woman in the world before the billions of television shows.
This great celebration of beauty has taken place in the second year around Johannesburg, and five candidates have made progress to the semifinal.
Miss Japonska Eruza Sasakiov, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratara and Yanbing Maova from Canada were during his African residence in Miss sport or Miss top model.
It was the real faith of the event.
It was wonderful to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen a lot of things and I have so many experiences!
A competition already run in the Republic of South Africa after the ninth will be sent directly from Midand, north of Johannesburg, from 17 a.m. (15 hours of world time).
I couldn't get out of a more beautiful country where I'm going to set up my crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm glad I could live it twice, believed the Miss of the world of Ksenia Sukkin in the hot summer.
For young Russia, her second residence in the Republic of South Africa took place in the spirit of reading meetings with other candidates and the new revelation of the country and its "land that is going to breathe".
After months of exhibitions, testing, meeting with the press and safari, Miss is now focusing on the competition itself.
Indka Pooja Chopraova hopes that he will go to the steps of Priyanky Chopraov, elected in 2000, which will also participate in the Aishwarye Raio, a 1994 victory that has become two Bollywood stars.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is the dream of every woman, but it's not just about looking.
We're sending out our countries, and I want to go home with the ring, says Miss India with a wide smile.
According to organizers, the 59th anniversary is brought into the spirit of music and dancing.
The candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and of course in blues.
The presentation will introduce the Chinese television modator Angela Chow, former queen of the South African Republic, Michelle McLean, and the president of the Miss of the World Council of Steve Douglas.
The South African Republic has shown that it is able to welcome the world with the reality that it is difficult to solve, declared Julia Morley, president of the world's Miss Competition.
The candidates participated in Safari, visited the famous city of Soweto, this time on the bike, and enjoyed the local cuisine.
The extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them his hand.
For the extraordinary president, she met Miss Sierra Leone.
The most beautiful reminder will undoubtedly remain the rescue in Cape Town (in the southeastern part of the country) for the World War to end in June 2010, which has helped the country to support something more.
I could've met people I didn't even dream about.
I'm sure I'll be back at the 2010 World Cup, says Miss Italy Alice Taticchi.
According to David's son, reports of Hallyday's status are "very positive."
The reports of Johnny Hallyday's status are "very positive" as David's son assured us when he arrived at the airport in Los Angeles, where he flew to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It's very strong and it's all going very well, David Hallyday announced when he left the plane that he flew from Paris shortly after 13 hours of the local time (21st hour of the world time)
The son of a song, who was calmed, announced that "the fastest" will be delivered to the Los Angeles hospital Cedars-Sinaï, to which Johny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for postoperative infections following the operation of an explosive mesobarella plant, which occurred on 26 November in Paris.
According to the press release, the night in Los Angeles was sung for reasons of "invented to an artificial sleep", which should prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was a medical doctor in the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where hospitalization was caused by an infection following an operation of an incineration of meciobedia plant performed on 26 November in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this content , the song must be re-examined from Wednesday to Thursday night .
According to AFP photographer, his wife Laeticia took part on Friday morning in the school performance of the French Lice in Los Angeles, visiting their daughter Jade.
The premier section of orthopedic surgery and traumatology of the hospital la Pitié-Salpétrière, Yves Catoné, announced that to sing to Los Angeles in the afternoon of the holiday.
The manufacturer strongly charged Dr. Stéphana Delajouxe, a neurosurgeon, who performed at the International Clinic du Parc Monceau in Paris on November 26.
They told us it was a massacre.
The surgeons from Los Angeles reported that they were beaten, said Mr. Camus.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus thinks Johnny Hallyday's gone too fast to Los Angeles and with the permission of his Paris surgeon."
I personally spoke to the doctor on the phone and the doctor assured me that this trip was no problem, which surprised me a lot, since I had already been suffering twice over my mediocre.
A while ago, at the RTL radio station, he indicated that the song apparently flew after the Parisian operation without the dreary, no matter what."
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well-known in artistic circles.
He spent a couple of days at a clinic in Neuley-sur-Seine, where he was born.
In 2007, Charlotte Gainsburg was also diagnosed with haematoma, resulting from brain bleeding.
It is also a doctor with a dark reputation, several times judged in cases of neglect of medical care, for tax reasons and for fraud.
The lawyer of the medical chamber Olivier Metzner identified him as a "man with no shoes", which is "regularly" before the medical chamber, and which you cannot even "recommended".
After a few days of silence Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed himself on Friday through his lawyer David Koubbi.
He announced that the delay had "just a good time" and the post-operative investigation was "normal".
The operation was not a haemorrhage, so the introduction of the tube was not necessary," he added.
The health problems of singing from year to year are growing and, in any case, the next tournament seems to remain with the audience.
It is clear that the deadline for the renewal of the planned tournament on January 8th (in Amiens, Mr. Reg.) is running too close, Camus declared.
The UDF will raise the tone and call the New York Centre side so that it will not continue to use their shorts.
The UDF, controlled by MoDemFrançoise Bayroua, responded on Friday to the attempt of the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morina to add to the short-term presence of the former Giscards, with the fact that they must not be used in any media under the threat of criminal assault.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to join the UDF briefly with the fact that François Bayrou does not deserve to bring her legacy after giving the left hand.
The Defence Minister, whose side is the UMP partner, was planning to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Nuveau Centre (NC).
This step has been supported by Hervé de Charetta (the former post-UMP now for the NC), which is attributed to the property of UDFs because it was first registered in 2004 in the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la ownerétêtelle).
But on Friday evening, the UDF team of friends controlled by François Bayrou, who have no intention of allowing themselves to be released, issued a formal request by the Minister and the Members to stop using the short term and to return the security mark under the threat of criminal prosecution.
In the last few days you have raised a disturbing statement that you propose to your political urge + take over+ a short UDF, writes the Society in its letter 19th of 24 members, such as François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, from MoDem or Senator Jean Arthuis from the Alliance of Centralists.
You have also considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your nickname +Nouveau centre+, with +UDF today+, also features signatures.
As you know, you have no right to use this summary, the UDF committee explains that it is asking the NC to remove all entries in the name of UDF from all promotional materials including its (your) website."
At the same time, Hervé de Charrete asks "to pass the security marks on to legitimate owners".
If you do not do so, we will appeal to the courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories will be warned.
In their letters, UDF "is a full political strike in 1978 " and they recall that Mr. Morin and his friends " chose " departure in 2007, " to create a competitive strike, as elsewhere in 2002, to set up UMP.
Therefore, the New Centre does not have any right to use the UDF (Union pour la democratie Frenche).
They also recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and to establish a committee responsible for covering the "moral and material interests" of Valérium Giscard d'Estaing.
With regard to Hervé de Chartete, the Committee continues, "when he registered a security note", not "for three years by UDF member", but UMP.
In a scandalous and subversive way, he used no existing acronym registration to do so on his own account.
This lack of motivation begins to change into criminal acts, spreads, and then ironies express themselves to the NC strategy: "It seems to us that as in politics and in ordinary life it is more valuable to create a name for ourselves than to come out of anonymity with a subversive name on which we have no right".
The case of Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier will be tried to abuse the status of weakness.
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to judge the artist Françoise-Marie Banier and decide whether he used the status of a weak eight-year-old billionaire to prepare her for part of her name, from which her daughter Liliane Bettencourt blame her.
Photographer (62 years), known as his famous photographers, will be next 15 and 16 April 2010 to abuse the status of weakness, which is a criminal act for which punishment is imposed for a maximum of 3 years and a fine of EUR 375 000.
This Decision confirms that it will actually proceed in the cause, which can be identified as one of the richest families in France, where mother and daughter are attacked together and fighting the control of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
At the same time, the 15th Criminal Court ordered a medical investigation of 87 years of Liliany Bettencourt, which should be conducted by three doctors.
The grandpa and the principal shareholders of L'Oréal always refused to submit such an investigation, not necessarily under the conditions offered by the State representative in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should prepare a report by 10 March 2010 and at the same time provide an explanation of whether Liliana Bettencourt could be found in the state of weakness and during the period.
I think she's going down.
I'm talking to her about it, and after hearing Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kieiman.
As regards the lawyer Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, the court welcomed the decision.
This is an excellent report(...). The expert shows that he confirmed with this old lady who needs protection, manipulative (M. Banier).
It's two years ago, the only daughter of Lilian Bettencourt began criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, photographers and artists, who has been guilty of using the status of her mother's weakness for years to obtain a grant of a billion euros in the form of checks, a life insurance contract or images of masters.
That's why Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be a photographer who thinks of a long-term friend.
While the court had to judge the right of the appeal lodged by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the court's fifth term of attorneys changed in time to a family time of truth.
Lawyer Liliany Bettencourt submitted three letters by his client (1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary and expressed his mistrust of the husband of François Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt, according to a lawyer, adds: "You could explain to my daughters that I wrote to Banier for fifteen years one to two times a day.
Ever since I got married, I've never been able to talk to François."
The State representative in Nanterre again found that the conduct of the complainants was not justified, more than that the guardian of the court had denied her request to initiate proceedings to issue legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is completely capable of participating in the court, not under protection or in custody.
No one else will go for it," confirmed the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the Court decided that Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers would express itself at the time of the initiation of the proceedings.
Management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our fight for economic intelligence has been crucial...
For more than ten years, the management of large companies has been reminded of the company's approach to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is to compete with the "assessments" of the mountain, as it was in the past, when it was necessary for consumers to take up products that came from the ideas of manufacturers.
The fact that the customer became the center of business companies, compared the marketing revolution to the market strategy of obtaining the right direction... and when the authoritarian efforts to incorporate products that differ from customer preferences, they return regularly!
The passive approach of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault companies are only a visible part of a much broader general phenomenon, which is predominantly in charge of managerial cadres.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
In fact, the EI "needs active access and ability to predict by all parties involved" and requires employees who are fully in conflict with the revenue of the authoritarian management.
That is why we call for the managerial revolution, which should aim at bringing workers to the centre of business interest as well as customers.
Relativity of internal investigations of public opinion.
Internal surveys of public opinion - as a questionnaire submitted to the employees of Orange companies - contribute to the revolution in managerial procedures?
I'm sorry I'm afraid I'm not.
Especially because I've already convinced myself that he's making a new situation with the structure after different deviations will come back primarily to... what she's always been doing!
However, the fact that authority, as one of the pathology of power, has increased significantly the burden of own failure.
And finally, because most of the managers have a simple view of human behavior.
Because they're graduates of high school for engineers, they have mechanically interpreted psychology.
Because of the consensus, they win the old behavior theory, the re-resurrected "renewed neuroscientists" from the United States, and are widely spread without increased knowledge of scientific constitutions and the media.
With the possibility of moving "packages" (sic) to manager connection, he has shown a recent study of the Ipsos agency on the Figaro.fr pages, which only creates managers in their position of mechanical management that is not suitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobility factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution is necessary for the proper functioning of modern businesses, presupposes the adoption of a final vision of human behavior.
It is based on the inclusion of the basic framework in all the objectives and practices of the management : for employees, commitments will be made only if they are used as a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At the present time, this concept of motivations of employees is limited to studies Motivation functional analysis.
These studies have shown that the value of their businesses on the basis of a particular dossier that enables them to assess by means of a picture that tells them what they are offering to achieve their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, managers can control, predict and anticipate their "social performances" and present their management of human resources "on the right path".
This creates a lively ground for the development of sound and effective economic intelligence.
I'm showing from Osla: "a righteous war" Obama has earned praise for his rights.
The American law on Friday welcomed the revelation that Barack Obama presented the day before in Oslo, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize holder rejected the concept of "righteous wars" against enemies of the United States.
Conservatives who initially voted in favour of the award of Obama's award on 9 October, this time the presidential statement, including Sarah Palin's former candidate for the vice-president in the elections in 2008.
I liked what he said, told Palin, the museum of the right Republican wing, for USA Today, and added that she herself expressed the "sometimes" of the war in her memories that are just going on.
The train is of course the last thing the Americans would like to have to work, but it's necessary.
All terrorists need to stay there, he thinks.
President Obama, who fought two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessor George W. Bushvi, justified the sending of forces on Thursday in Oslo and used a demonstration to explain his decision to send another 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days ago.
Next Obama's opponent, Newt Gingrich, agreed that the president took a "very good job" in Oslo.
I think that the event was really good, congratulated the former president of the Snowy Representative, who assessed the President's term "the existence of evil in the world".
In my own way, I considered this phenomenon as a whole historical, reporting to Gingri during the conversation on the "The Takeaway" radio series.
The former Ambassador, whom some consider to be a potential Republican candidate in presidential elections in 2012, was forced to see "the Left President" remind the members of the Nobel Prize Committee that they would not be free and could not surrender the price for peace if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, former director of George W. Bush, now editor Washington Post, Obama introduced a "very American show".
Not only did he appear as "worldly" as always, but "speaking as an American president" and reminded Europeans that they live in a safe bubble that they didn't create themselves, and that they don't do much to keep it," Gerson agreed.
Among a few minors of the range of rights belong to the series of Bushes, former spokesman at the UN John Bolton, who has identified the phenomenon as "single, obnoxious and without inspiration", as indicated on the National Review Online website.
On the left of the president, for example, democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is afraid to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
"If we fight in the cause of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the medium-left press is standing against the president's commendable position.
Although Los Angeles Times continues to consider the award of Obama's peace price as early as possible, he assessed his appearance as a "debt" and even for a speaker known as his talent.
Osla's statement should serve as a guide to the international resolution of conflicts, in the fight against poverty and oppression," said the California newspaper.
Both of them "did a show that was necessary," agreed New York Times, and marked the show "for simplicity and learning".
Road transporters: three maratons to the agreement that preserves the supply of supplies at Christmas.
Following the three single marathons, the Boards of Road Transport and TLF, the sole organisation of employees, which remained until the end, came to an end on Friday evening to the agreement that ended the call for a strike and a threat that exceeded the supply of supplies at Christmas.
The State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, on the Friday signing of the agreement, expressed "joy" after several talks that began in the middle of the morning.
After the second night, delegates were discussing on Friday early morning, hoping that the amendment of the agreement would be signed as soon as the morning ends.
Despite the fact that three employees' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) were disbanded.
But there was a need for more than six hours of meeting, which started at 11 hours to all agree and at 18 hours signing the agreement.
This conflict "would hurt businesses very much" and "the tragedy would be dangerous that the holidays would be broken at the end of the year," Bussereau declared.
The change in the text includes an increase of 4% in the lowest wages (in local and regional transport) and 2.9% in the highest wages (International transport).
The hour value of the minimum payments shall be increased from 8,72 euros to 9,06.
It's not much, but it's a lot of effort, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight we will order our members not to come to the blockades, no blockages of emergency centers.
But there may be a few more adversaries who are not at peace," he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of the TLF, welcomed the "legal agreement", even though it was difficult to acknowledge the increase in high payments due to international competition.
According to him, it is estimated that an increase of EUR 170 per month will be between EUR 100 and EUR 120 per month.
With regard to the agreement on sound understanding and respect for employees, CMaxime Dumont (CFDT) announced while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement".
According to Richard Jauberta (CGT), this is a "friendly compromise".
The agreement also proposes the revaluation of travel costs of 3% and the report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow focus on the issue of 13 payment and modernization of the collective contract.
Bussereau recalled "a reduction of EUR 100 million on corporate tax" which was the subject of the government's amending proposal for a 2009 bill, which voted on Thursday to Friday National Assembly.
The government requires the Senate to vote in favour.
The signature allows this agreement to be applied first to companies members of this organisation, later to the whole committee, in the case of enlargement to the Ministry of Labour.
It's actually "in the shortest term," Bussereau made sure.
The whole process can only be corrupted by a lack of agreement between employees' organisations.
The FNTR organisation speaks of "good trade" because EUR 100 million has been offered to the sector under the compensation of part of the coal tax.
The State Secretary for Transport has led us to the emergency treatment of no one due to mutual analysis, but so that he would not break up the bread eaters in the time of the Christmas holidays, he complained about Unostra.
For the Otre organisation, the agreement is threatening to "recover large numbers of small and medium-sized enterprises in the next 12 months".
Direct train RER A: the suspension of the weekend transport, the committees not satisfied with the proposals of the RATP transport company.
The interruption of transport on the lines of RR A, which is the largest line of urban mass transport in France, will also continue during the weekend, as the fifth meeting between the committees and the holding of the RATP on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results in the claim for the premium.
On Saturday and Sunday, and on the days of the important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will only be driving between 10 and 20 hours, on the main train (between La Defense and Nation) every second train, except that train only one train from four.
The proposal to SNCF will be cancelled in Nanterre Prefecture and passengers will be forced to stop on another train.
The business houses Galeries Lafayette, which expect more than 200,000 customers every day, have welcomed the fact that "RATP has tried to secure connections with large business houses".
RER A line leads from the west to the east of the Paris agglomeration.
The route to RATP leads from Saint-German-en-Laye to Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger to Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday there was a train with two and practically no traffic in the past outside of the ship, as was planned.
As in the fourth quarter, the people of Ile de France made a difference and did not control the damage on the premises.
So early in the morning, there was much less people than usual at the station Saint-German-en-Laye (Yvelines) than because of the lack of friends and students.
Jack Nkakina, an engineer, 29 years old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he had risen about "the past hour and half so he could be sure he would come in time".
The Saint-Lazare airport was not filled, reported the SNCF State Railway, and it was also proposed to increase the number of passengers and guards.
Direct train RER A carried out by SNCF to or from the Cergy-Le-Haut or from the Saint-Lazare airport with access to the metro.
The next wave of meetings will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will assess the results of the Friday afternoon meeting with the guidance considered by the committees as "low".
The RER management proposes a consultation on a special protocol for direct train RER A on all pages, adjustment of working hours, careers etc.
However, this is not the case with drivers who require a deserved award, according to Thierry Garona (Committee).
RATP has even put forward proposals for the premium, which has damaged the CGT by "no problem with driving while on the road transport and SNCF it went".
At a new meeting scheduled for Monday, "near closer to examining the conditions of enforcement of the call", RaTP stressed the transport business.
Which was the reason why the councils think they're making a business of weekend travel sports.
In the afternoons, about 150 drivers had a business committee in its Paris seat.
The conduct which eventually rejected any discussion during the proceedings was therefore decided in the interest of "incidence" for the meeting.
It is dangerous that the conflict will spread on the RR B line on Tuesday, after Unsa and Independent will be notified of standby readiness.
The committees request a premium of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros changeable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (Jeh), Independents (Independent)) and are concerned with the deteriorating working conditions on this line which transports millions of passengers daily.
RER direct train drivers make careers 2200 to 2700 euros gross and 600 to 650 euros premiums for irregular working hours and work on Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish court has ruled for the Kurdish side and this decision has had serious consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court decided on Friday to abolish the main pro-Kurdish party in the country. This decision immediately led to protest in the demonstration in the Kurdish community in the south-east country and in Istanbul.
This decision can be significantly complicated by the task of governments trying to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and try to end 25 years of conflict.
The party to the Democratic Society (DTP) was released because it became "a threat to the activities of the threat of state independence and its indivisibility," President of the Supreme Court of Hasim Klic told journalists after four days of meeting.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, when a majority of seven votes were needed for the release of the party, Kilic indicated that 37 side posts, including its President Ahmeta Turk and Ambassador Aysely Tugluk, had a ban on participation in political life for five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the cancellation of the parliamentary immunity that Mr Turk and Mrs Tugluk and the confiscating of the property of the party to the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP side has 21 cross-borders in Parliament (from 500).
The management of the party has already pointed out before the summit that it would be preferable to leave Parliament rather than act as a messenger without political jurisdiction.
The decision is to continue the process initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation of Abdulrahman Yalcinke, who accuses DTP of obedience to "commands" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider as a terrorist organization.
Many observers are convinced that DTP is a legitimate political rival of the PKK.
The party ensures that there is no "core connection" with the PKK, but refuses to sign it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to reconcile it with it.
The court’s verdict comes at a time when the government gives the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and tries to limit the support of the Kurds against the PKK and thus end the conflict.
The DTP management confirmed that the release of the party could lead to a renewal of the pressure on South-East Anatolia, where in recent weeks there has been a lot of demonstrations against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan has been detained.
From the announcement of justice, thousands of demonstrators gathered in front of DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the south, mostly Kurds.
The police used heavy grenades and waterworks, the demonstrators took Molot's cocktails again or shot stones out of their hands.
In Istanbul, about a hundred people were also shown.
After the verdict was delivered, Mr. Turk stated that the decision of justice was only a "prolonged delusion".
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurds, Mr. Red.) by order of the party, declared in press.
The government, created on the other hand, came from a Islamic coup, and condemned this decision.
We're from the principle of the destruction of the side.
It doesn't work out, Minister for Energy Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is simply a reflection of the democratic proposals initiated by the government, politicians Ahmet Island commented.
Understandably, we can expect reactions from PKK, add.
On Thursday, the PKK reported one of the most deadly attacks in northern Turkey, which killed three days earlier seven soldiers.
Can come up with snow
It's really hot, that's what Wolfgang Braubburger went through.
Not because he wants to hurt citizens, he says the manager of the winter section of the FES technical services.
But so that his employees can try and learn to control all the driving techniques.
This weekend could be the first time on meteorologists.
Over 300 employees and 120 vehicles are prepared to take care of snow and ice.
The FES shall therefore act in accordance with the specific plan.
As the snow in Frankfurt completely and the heat falls below zero, they go out on 20 so-called benefits, and the big bauburger explains.
Among these are main and transit tires such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also incomes for coaches, direct public transport lines, speeding zones and cuttings like Atselbergstraße.
The FES service starts at three o'clock in the morning.
In case of need, it is necessary for a maximum of three hours to be filled with liquid salt, which is better maintained, about 1040 kilometres.
Therefore, FES starts at three o'clock in the night, "to be free to transport to employment".
It's not easy when it starts snowing first at 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the director of the winter department of technical services, 'cause no one's willing to make shoes instead.'
First of all, when it's so cold, there's a number of revenue and promotional communications, including Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority has side and side roads.
Braburger knows they'll be in trouble.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES is on its way, primarily in dangerous places and crossings.
FES cannot generally care for all cyclosty.
In Frankfurt, a special service, which monitors from 22 to 4.30, is said to be Brauburger.
Because they create a quick ice cream, the shoes run out as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
If necessary, the police are also calling.
Dynoses
Tawa hallae seemed like a lot of other massage dinosaurs: the animals were two meters long and 1,50 meters high after two strong rear ends, had a deep lip with sharp, stuck teeth, short front ends with slender ropes and long tails.
If this kind lived a few million years later, it wouldn't be extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and fellow students in the fourth edition of Science writes that Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs to have these physical signs.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in New Mexico today, which was then located in the same dry area of the supercontinent of Pange.
Tawa will open a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It tells us a lot about the relationship, the expansion and the meaning of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists started digging in Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
Sometimes one day we found thousands of dinosaur costumes, which is unknown for trias encounters, informs a member of the Randall Irmis team from the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones have quickly identified scientists as a new species.
During the funeral, the rest were gathered with all five units.
The analysis confirms the theory of the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the Indian sun god Hopi.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an unusual finding: "The fossils of dinosaurs from the trias are very rare, most of them will find only individual sections."
Other experts on dinosaurs do not share this excitement without reward.
Especially this sedentary finding is not, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
According to the current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared 230 million years ago.
The composition of the oldest fossils is not complete, so the classification of previews is mostly controversial.
The experts discuss, for example, when the nurses divided into three most important development lines: the masochropodes to which Tyranosaurus rex, Velociraptor and birds later belonged, the "long-term" four sauropods and their neighbours, and the Ornithischian biologists (ptakupánvi), such as Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa Hallae is an analysis of Nesbitta and its colleagues' initial therapy.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
In the Tawa hallae, researchers found, for example, evidence of air bubbles that also have offspring of birds' thermopods.
Thanks to air waves, breathing birds is more effective than hunters.
In the Tawa hallae, the bones of the peta were apparently filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive terrorist with air waves, says Randall Irmis.
Since the adjacent line of giant sauropods was also later airships and light bones, this useful innovation has already already created a likely joint transition between the two groups.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because so far the most primitive dinosaurs have lived in South America, scientists have produced that the lakes appeared first.
According to this, three development lines were broken down very soon and extended from South America to all continents, which then formed a single ground mass as a supercontinent.
She would also talk about the fact that the team found together with Tawa Hallae the rest of the two others, especially the collection of friendly terrorists.
These three cannot come from one common, hosted advance, the scientists argue.
We believe that there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of scientific study.
Of course, there are also discrepancies.
Another older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to a group of the most difficult dinosaurs, lived in Poland today, says Bosnian paleontologist Martin Sander.
His theory could give a collective image because there were a lot of primitive fossils of dinosaurs in South America that were kept in the rest of the continents.
According to the dinosaurs, the relatively rare next line of the plasma species has developed to the ruling merchants on the earth during the Middle Ages, it remains dominant.
During the trip, dinosaurs shared their living space with many other beaches, such as the fronts of today’s crocodiles and flying lakes and the number of other lakes.
At the end of the trias, dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the nearby trias and jurors died.
History of success did not last forever
There are two hypotheses like this to explain, says Martin Sander.
It could have come to the mass relief that dinosaurs have survived, but the beach isn't.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could exert competition.
History of success didn't last forever anyway.
About 150 million years later, he helped another group of animals, who also grew up in trias and lived in the state: pigs.
Solidarity from Vidá after Sao Paulo
The list is long and signatures are international.
The list includes professors at the University of Toronto, University of Cambridge, visual universities or Berkeley in California.
Students from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paula, Berlin, or Brem.
The police circling of the French University of Goethe's surrounded casino became a global mess.
278 teachers and students of Goeth University, but also high schools throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America are solidarity with protest students in the Westend camp.
In a statement written by German and English, the president of the police is "not accepting".
Because the walls and works of art were torn apart, university president Werner Müller-Estler allowed the building to be demolished, which had a student and lecturer last week.
Immediately five students were injured.
The damage to things, the courts of the signatories, does not justify "violent release of self-organised students and learning police command".
The removal represents an unacceptable principle for freedom of research and science.
The high focus on vandalism serves as "illegality and criminalisation of the protest" and draws attention to content.
The Bureau abstained from the necessary discussion.
Presenters call for the cessation of criminal proceedings.
It is claimed that most of the intruders did not support permanent damage.
Corrected protest
The young Verdi committee organisation and the German board of directors are also solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern about its own future, says German youth Wardi Alexander Klein.
The Hessen Ministry of Science, Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), is currently advancing the process of university president and police.
We are grateful to the university president.
Disappearances and seizures are simply unacceptable means, said on Thursday at Actuellen Stunde (Current Hour) in Wiesbaden's country fleet.
We have understanding of the protest, but we have no understanding of vandalism, said the country's messenger for the CDU Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, they saw the opposition groups SPD, the Greens and the Linkes.
The CDU took a bribe from the wall to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of following the arguments and requirements of the students, they came to an end.
Linkes put forward a proposal called by the Minister in order to report the police arrest.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years, it paid for a secret city, not accessible to visitors from the west.
Zelenograd, one of the 10 times of the capital city of Moscow, was closely monitored by the Soviet Union, where secret military research was carried out.
Today, this period is considered with 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers away from the Moscow centre, for the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centres are located here.
Since September 2008, green-grained contacts have been established with the french scientific centre Riedberg - with the university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
A number of mutual visits were made, and in the middle they signed in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg "Protocol on Close Cooperation".
The Russian delegation, along with the Moscow majority, Jurij Rosljak and the prefect from Zelenograd Anatolij Smirnov, signed for Frankfurt a leading rapporteur for the planning of Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, the representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises living in an environmental research seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific exchange
It's about a regular scientific exchange.
But it's also about economic relations.
The FIZ company will be able to catch up on the growing Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian scientists want to meet orders in Germany.
Zelenograd is a seat of important Russian research institutes and companies.
Among them is the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the major Sitronics and Russia Electronics.
The period was established in 1958 as a so-called "social city planned" for military research.
Zelenograd (the "Green City" translation) obtained its name according to the country in which the research equipment is established.
Stuttgart Bridge
Dimenze Stuttgart 21 is not ready enough at all.
For project recipients, one is simply about the "new heart of Europe".
All right. S21 is more than the launch of the storm than the monster building, which will lift the main city of Bádenska-Württemberg for one decade into the desperate chaos.
Stutgart 21 was born in the '80s.
The main railway station, which ended in the center of the city, was then considered a 19th-century transport-pronged vehicle, resulting in the rapids of modern rail transport, because it took a lot of time to move the train back ahead.
Take a moment to stop, come on - so it should work.
And that's why there's a mix of major tensions: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart, the transit route lies half the trajectory of the trans-European Railway Masters between Paris and Budapest/Bratislav - that is why the slogan on "European heart".
It actually starts with S21, although the 80s visas are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious projectors themselves recognized that the construction of buildings in the Hesen and Bavarian capital is almost unfinanced.
Since the existence of modern bicycle trains with motor and driving vehicles at both ends, there are no problems with driving and driving.
However: The new ICE route to Ulm is beginning with Stuttgart 21 including.
It's over the land and the municipal policy.
The costs also work because the risk of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic is taxable and not state-owned.
Urbanistically, the project can yet apologize in some way.
There will be a new city space, which will - if we trust computer images of designers - contain a lot of green.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
The passenger trains and the construction of the tractors are designed for personal transport, which - typically in the 1980s - has contributed to huge growth.
There was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern transport policies have to go, however, first of all, to strengthen freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than freight cars on the road.
But the new track is not suitable for cost trains because of a sudden pace.
Even more important is that S21 does not directly affect the amounts of other railway projects.
In Sweden, six billion euros had to be frozen.
It's an official number.
Experts consider it a real ten to 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade, there will be a lack of funding on other emergency points and a difficult place in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport is 60 larger projects.
One of the most important is the building of a 180-mile bridge along the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, this track has been set at a low temperature.
There's a need to press right here.
But S21 will be very quick.
The road ahead of Rīna will become the backbone of international freight transport: directly in the heart of Europe.
The Government has examined the airport judgment
The German Government has been open in Wiesbaden County if it is going against the ruling of the Hessen Court of Justice (VGH) on the prohibition of nightly flights and allows it to be revised.
The Coalice CDU/FDP relied on experts to legalize more than 400-star VGH judgment, said Minister of the Dieter Posch (FDP).
VGH in Kassela today has stated in writing that the state would have to rehabilitate the nightly flight ban in the case of the construction of the planned northwestern coast of Frankfurt airport.
The permit of 17 years between 23 and 5 hours, as predicted by the Government of the Netherlands, does not comply with the law governing the protection of the population against nightly air pollution.
The coalice must be decided by 4 January if it is required to review the judgment.
The opposition criticized this expenditure and appealed to the representatives of the government to make a review of the Federal Court of Justice in Lipska.
The Chief of the SPD Group Torsten Schäfer-Gombel called the CDU and the FDP to return to promises regarding the order of the night before the election. Otherwise, it is possible to value it as a "derogation of the word".
It's so hard to get your word if you can keep it, the head of the Green Tarek Al-Wazir said in a statement on the FDP optional slogan "We hold the word".
Minister Posch rejected the defeat of Schäfer-Gümpel, the Dutch government is trying to get to its nightly flight through "the crossing of rights and tricks".
The exact rule of law needs its time.
Coalice doesn't want to work on the basis of "fast first mind".
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The reasons of his group for the nightly flight ban were never the same as the opposition.
U.S. Banks Payment Aid
U.S., the crisis of broken big banks is getting rid of state debt.
The Bank of America paid back the average aid from the Tarp bank savings fund at a total of $45 billion (about EUR 30 billion).
According to the report of the U.S. station CNBC, State aid is also planned to be granted by the Citigroup.
The institutions therefore want to break free from the restrictions to which the money has been received - the restrictions on the payment of bonuses to managers and the reward of high fees.
The Bank of America made up 19 billion dollars of clean money to investors, thanks to a variable bond.
The remainder was taken out of its stock, which was filled out outside of the other thanks to the sales of the committee.
The Chief of Banks Kenneth Lewis thanked the US taxpayers in the middle of the evening with an expression of thanks: The monetary injection helped us overcome a difficult time.
The financial institution was injured at the top of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank of Merrill Lynch.
The Citi group wants to be freed from its obligations to the State by also providing money on the capital market.
With a call to source, the CNBC informed that this US bank could have already reported a capital increase of around $20 billion on Thursday.
The language Citigroup didn't want to express himself about it.
In June, they paid for the help of Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Key to teleport
It was just faster than expected.
The station presented the appearances only two weeks after the ZDF's board of directors came out of the office of the chief editor, Nikolause Brender.
Yesterday night, the gremium wanted to agree on that person.
Peter Frey, a leading study of the ZDF in the main city of Berlin, was appointed as a favorite.
But the station didn't confirm it - officially so that she wouldn't pass the process.
But Rolly could also play that they didn't want to harm the intention of ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal did not go to the board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs nine members of the class.
The result of the vote was not known before the conclusion of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter spent five years in the board of directors with his proposal to extend his contract with Nikolaus Brender for the next five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven were against him.
The Union majority in the board of directors had already signaled several weeks before the elections that he did not want to sign Brender in the office.
Hessen Prime Minister Roland Koch organized an opposition against the chief editor.
He refused further detention in the Office of the highly regarded chief of staff by arguing that the amounts of monitoring of the reporting of the ZDF have been exceeded for Brender.
Until shortly before the elections, therefore, there were protests in which the political impact on the ZDF was strongly criticized.
Finally, 35 lawmakers were involved in the debate, who evaluate Kokh's procedure as anti-corruption.
It wasn't for anything.
About
Peter Frey was born in Bingen on August 4, 1957.
He studied politics, pedagogical and romanticism.
He worked for Southwest Funk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, first to "heute-journal".
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 the personal rapporteur of the chief editor; 1991/92 wrote in Washington; by 1998 the leader and moderator of the "Morgenmagazins"; by 2001 the foreign policy of the ZDF; from that time leading the main study of the ZDF.
After Brender, who was elected in mid-term by a professional press media magazine for the year, sat down, told Greens that they were making a constitutional complaint.
Kokhov's procindidate in the board of directors, Rinsk-Falk Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the collective countries should change the state agreement with the ZDF so that the staff proposals of the intensant cannot be blocked politically motivated by the majority.
Beck, however, also refused to exclude foreign policies from the ZDF Board of Supervisors.
Brender's supposed successor, Peter Frey, gave the board a clever chess scene - immediately after Brender's meeting, he criticized it strongly.
As a result of this evidence of newspaper independence, he could be appointed in the position of the chief editor without losing his face, such as Schächter, so he could be called by the board without being suspected that the party would be pushed into the office.
In the site architecture, Frey is free of charge for left liberals.
The studio consists of harmampades
Partly success for students: After the year of graduation, they finally joined the cultural ministers' countries on Thursday: At the conference of the Ministers of Culture and High School Rectors, both sides agreed that they would like to improve the study conditions for balearers and teachers.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
In particular, it was agreed to reduce the burden of testing: Basically, each study module should end with one test.
In addition, the labour burden of students should be checked, and "real and misleading measures" should be promised.
Politicians and high schools want to simplify learning between high schools in Germany and abroad.
The partner countries are committed to creating more flexible joint structural tasks for the Baltic and Magistrate Study Teams.
The Earth's distances should cease to exist.
Less Test
From the beginning of student protests in June, the ministers of culture and university rectors had in their mouths specific words about better study.
They are now first filled with specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Council has concluded that the number of sample parts is reduced dramatically: "Each module will only be completed by one test", says a 30-page report, which must be re-regulated to approve the study committees.
"Very low-test burden," said the Accreditation Council of Reinhold Grimm, should be "a stopover of the wrong development which clearly limited the scope of the study."
There must be "studylessness" in the future "excellent criteria" in implementation.
Modules and content "must be strictly checked" so that "students will not be severely restricted when selecting
"Seminars."
Students should be "a measure of space that enables and supports their own initiative".
The rules shall be applicable to the approval of new study committees, after examination but also for existing study groups.
You need to "reaccredit" every five years – which means that it will last until 2015 before all the study teams are checked.
The responsibility for this is throughout Germany ten accreditation agencies, which are subject to the accreditation councils established by the partner countries.
In October, the Ministers of Culture called on the "big" partner country to enable the agency to be able to complete the education to be not too large and a test regime is not strict.
In individual partner countries, universities and higher schools have already agreed with the country's ministries on the appropriate measures.
As recently as the only country has contributed to the Pony-Falcko additional resources for further development of the Bolonic process.
Higher schools should, above all, build consultation programmes and study advice and strengthen experimental and foreign authorities.
The countries and high schools want to invest 10 million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, he wanted to give Parliament a new high school law.
According to it, only one test should be required to complete the study module.
The formation of the study should be even more flexible, to ensure recognition of other high schools and facilitate access to the master.
By the end of the next year, the order of all the study teams in the country should be checked.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again agreed on the study conditions in the country.
According to the praise, there was also criticism of the rescue.
The Society's presentation of the Juso High School Groups called for the creation of education policy not to be played in the future "with closed doors" of ministers and high school directors.
At the latest after the meeting, "you should also speak at least the words" as well as the students as the persons concerned.
The future academics also received support from the president of the High School Rectors Conference (HRK), Margaret Wintermantel, "We need students' experience," said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministry of Culture with which HRK was working on a joint reform report.
According to the Committees of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn solution was not far enough: they require a legal framework that would allow every student with a baliary title to access the construction master’s studio.
For the second country, it must ensure that today's generation of students of the Biafarian Committees has sufficient space in the Magisterical Study Areas with the best study conditions, said member of GEW Andreas Keller.
The partner countries must employ far more than they do.
The Ministers of Culture, however, did not show free access to the Master's programmes.
More than a note under the spell to Hert Müller.
Getting to Germany and outside is nice, unless there is no control..." sounds the opening line of one precise poet Werner Söllner, who in this weighed language poem thematic experience of the arrival of a dissident who gained freedom, as well as of his language environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Romanian Banát, first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and later as a lecturer of one child bookstore, then moved to Frankfurt over Mohane in 1982.
Sölnner was awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he presented poetry at the legendary French Goethe University of Goethe, and has been the leader of the Hesen literature forum in Moussonturm in Frankfurt since 2002.
An important milestone was set up last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich on "German literature in Romania in a mirror and a broken picture of its security acts".
Apparently, Söllner left a statement in front of his colleagues by Romanian German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totoek, Franz Hodjaek and Helmutham Frauendorfer, recognizing his cooperation as a secret informant of the Romanian Secret Service Security.
Together with some of the guests, Sölner received a German price in 1989.
Attempts to push the first began suddenly, first in 1971.
I went on to Söllner, "Then someone who didn't protect himself enough from security threats."
Agent Werner Söllner is a secret agent, Walter.
At the same time, the Nobel Prize for Herté Müller’s and its unambiguous literary arrangement with the dictatorial regimes is a literary scene, and in particular the community of German authors coming from Romania, the case is highlighted by the depth and complexity of the political system, which is based on control and spying.
Werner Söllner isn't, at least if you can say it according to the state of knowledge, only the priest, but he's also the victim.
In the Security Act, the secret agent Walter played a role, said after Sölner's confession Michael Markel and pointed out the positive effect of a secret agent Walter had on himself.
"He cut me off" then in all the essential points for him, says Marcel.
It's moral duty to make this note.
Sölner's statement was in this form and was not expected before this publication, but it is not simply surprising to recognize the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service.
Herta Müller wrote in July when she read her own document, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for spies Security.
The touch, it can be assumed, will be speculation and, in some cases, probably know what name is hidden behind the cover name Sorin, Voica and Walter as well.
Otherwise than in the Turkish, in the middle of a very clear view of the Stasi component, manipulation with the rest of the controls of Security is still very disfuscible.
In recent years, the systematic world has been frozen and restricted.
One of the Birthler authorities, which is responsible for the work of the National Council on Security (CNSS), was established early in 1999, and the issue of the Act has continued since then more slowly.
There has been a law governing the management of the ingredient since 2005.
The fact that the former members of the Security Council still have a significant impact in Romania, after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Hert Müller’s speech, one of the former security heads of Temeszvaru expressed his rejection of the assessment.
He's a psycho, and he's finally heard only once.
The violence of power has been expressed here completely in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, in the case of Sölner, as well as in the case of a hidden charge, there are inevitable questions.
The special response of the listeners to Sölner's confession is expected to determine the continuation of this chapter more closely after learning about the guilt and the study.
To the genius of Herty Müller's work, which yesterday took Nobel's price, it's more than a note under the spell.
Found the Championships League
It seemed as if a purely dressed trade representative came from a delicious Christmas dinner on which he distributed to the producer of the sport goods of sweetness when he set up a quarter of an hour after midnight in the welcome category C new coach VfBr Christian Gross in the service of an orange colored sponsor.
A man with a brand-new dance was allowed to drive after him to a strange city.
Otherwise, he could drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and the drunk man was 55 years old too.
It was a nice night, but tomorrow she'll be on her way to work.
Or it'll start first.
The words first three days of Switzerland's engagement: "We have reached eight finals", which in the Champions League thanks to the victory 3:1 over the Unirea Urzicen from Romania, "but we cannot be sure of success: it will be a brutally hard fight against composition."
"The far more important task" stands before us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance of the royal class in the Mohuči and in the ordinary days of the league.
And stop again obvious weaknesses after three quick bones of Maricy (5), Tresche (8) and Pogrebnyka (11).
Losing
The Osmiffinal Champions League will be released on 18 December in Nyonu.
The joy of Babbel's stepfather will therefore remain preserved.
Not only in a doctor who is not sure of the Stuttgart professional, but in a short time of self-consciousness, will be able to find pleasure and pleasure in the game.
I went to the players and I told them that they should focus on their strong pages and I tried to be more cautious, explained the healing of Gross's soul as simple as a successful recipe, which, however, did not show any effect on Babbel's movement but no longer.
"When a new impulse comes in the football, sometimes things that you wouldn't consider possible will happen," admitted Bobbel's companion Jens Lehmann.
And Sami Khedira, who, after a multi-day stopper caused by injuries, became the best player on the floor immediately by his dynamics, tried to describe the perceived "fenomen" with the title "clean air" and the working procedures of the new-man: "He is a man who is radical and requires discipline.
That's what we need in the present situation."
It must have been a mistake for Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart is not saved yet, warns sports president Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
Like Gross, players and managers don't want to overestimate the victory against the weak reward and simply overloaded Romanian host weapon.
They would even win in Glasgow, before there came a massive explosion after a 0:4 strike in Leverkusen, considering Kedira.
And sports president Horst Heldt reminded us that one goal has been achieved in the season, the other one is still far away.
We're not in the water yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday after the first home victory after three months, was caused by weekend events that were fresh in the form of a television interview with the banker Jens Lehman in front of the game.
They're decisions that he's acting differently from Jens. Heldt's firm Lehman's criticism.
He tried to persuade the representative of the poor conduct and decided to change the coach after the pressure on the audience fans.
And that he was thrown off his free day after the games, Lehmann identified him as a sign of the lack of sovereignty and revenge.
Lehman's products "forms pure egoism", sold Heldt and announced the consequences for the bankers.
Both four-year-olds will no longer have any joy in life.
In any case, they are with others that without the work of the trained team, it would not be possible to play so loud and combatally.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great part of success", they say Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and a man with an Igalitic ring agrees.
Soap of the world's mystery in heavy weight
Military Duel in Bern: Recruiter Kevin Johnson has always provoked words and gestures of the world's Vitalie Klića.
However, after 12 hard roads, the Ukrainians violated their title in the heavy weight of the WBC Boxer Organization.
The decision-makers were united.
Hamburg - Vitalij Clicko remains the world's master in the box in heavy weight.
38-year-old WBC champion died on Saturday in Bern American Kevin Johnson unanimously on points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Click, this is the third successful title appeal after his return in October 2008.
In the past, Ukraine was twice the world's master of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't happen to anyone who expected it.
In turn, he improved his balance on 39 winnings in 41 professional files, twice as a result of injury.
The challenger Johnson was first defeated in the 24th file.
Before the collapse of the 17,000 dragons in the Bernese arena, he led 2,02 meters high Click the file with his boots in particular.
About ten inches lower than Johnson, who spoke before the end of the Klički era, but stood before the masters of the world, so Kličko could not establish a decisive strike with his dangerous right.
All he did was make a passive Johnson on the challengers a little bit and only tried to get into other cars.
The click of the net provoked words and gestures, his skills, but the mystery of the world was just small.
But still, it's the first second boxer after Tim Hoffmann in 2000, who fought with Klick for twelve cars.
Before the war, the appellant was in the Swiss capital for divorce.
He hit the click as "repudiated zombies", which "can't be right".
During the five-year period, he let the champion out of sight, took Johnson out of the sunlight's nose, so he could see his eyes.
Fourth victory after Click Return
The click also remained intact after the fourth file on 11 October 2008.
After almost four years of stopping in Berlin, he defeated the Nigerian Samuel Peter and took back his "own" WBC song, which he had to take before without fighting.
This year, he was released at the exhibition of Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States.
In this file I got only one morning and physically in good shape, causing the click to return to the ring quickly.
His dream remains, but all four important titles in the family remain.
Brother Vladimír is the world's master of WBO and IBF.
But the WBA is wearing Brit David Haye, who met in November at the tower of 2,13 feet of high Nikola Vulaev.
Haye fired in the summer fight against Kličk, which was planned for the summit.
He's deliberately planning his promotional company's fight against Kličkov at the London Wembley Stadium.
Kunduz event
The head of the Greens Group, Jürgen Trittin, has identified the wrong information regarding the case of Kunduz, Minister of Defence of Guttenberg, for a lie.
The SPD and Linke (Left) call for an explanation to be given.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest news reports of the invasion of Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has allowed a known complaint.
Minister for the Death Bombing of Two Cisters in September said "indisputably wrong", the head of the Greens Jürgen Trittin Group said in the Saturday report of the ARD "Tagesschau".
Let's call it a common term: Lhal.
The murder certificate was issued without respect for the rules of the International Security Support Forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the basis for the report that NATO had, which Mr. Guttenberg read, said Trittin.
On Friday, it was discovered that the attack was not only about the destruction of unmanned cars, but also about the intention of killing two Taliban leaders.
During the American invasion, requested by the German commander Kundus, Colonel Klein, the NATO investigation showed that up to 142 people were killed or injured.
Greens, SPDs and Linkes called on the Social Officer of Angel Merkel's (CDU) Saturday to express themselves immediately in front of the Colonel's table and also to explain what Guttenberg actually knew about this incident.
Mrs. Merkel has to explain whether the strategy for the targeted killing is part of the Afghan Social Policy - and if the Office of the Office of the Chancellor, Bundeswehr and the reporting service approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and colleagues from the Green Renate Kunasto have called.
The speech of Ulrich Wilhelm's government strongly rejected the criticism.
The office of Chancellor has no impact on the specific finding of Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, a complaint was also filed against the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the resignation of general Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the State Secretary Peter Wicherta.
According to the information provided by SPIEGEL, both Guttenberga informed correctly and fully about the background of the attack on the tank.
It officially stated that the existence of the NATO report should be rejected and silenced by ministers of sensitive detail.
However, around the two senior officials, it was agreed that they had even warned the Ministry of Defence on several reports, including a bilateral document by Colonel Klein and one report by the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sontagszeitung" reports that Wichert had, inter alia, asked in letters to explain the situation.
It has been noted that he has not yet received any answers.
The Ministry did not issue a statement on Saturday and pointed out that this would be resolved in the committee of inquiry of the Party's fleet, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some see images in the white state and hear voices that others don't see and hear.
Not only do mental illness or drug addiction affect the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as he's in his sleep, he's all right.
If we are lying with our eyes closed in our dark room, we should be surrounded by the most wonderful representations and fantasy illusions.
However, those who live in the shadow of sleep, see and hear things that others do not see and hear, pay most of today’s Western world for lies or drugs, or at least as wild.
However, such images and voices do not exist only in the mental realm of patients or in drug abuse.
Vinu has our imagination: the same neuronal processes that allow us to propose homes, draw pictures or write novels, are there and there to create a barrier between dream, imagination and reality.
Dreams of a changed state of consciousness can be produced in the most diverse forms, in a better case, we call them vision, in worse error.
Although the initiator and the effect may be lost, however, the mystical vision of Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experience of the prophet New-Age Carlos Castanedy, the shamman status of bloating, psychosis and hallucinations can be derived from similar processes.
Hallucination or vision results when neuronal transmissions of the brain - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin, and acetylcholine - occur and the interaction between different parts of the brain is broken.
Complex hallucinations and insane thoughts occur very often in skiing psychosis.
He's got no gravity on him.
The connection between the blues and the dream was between the philosophies and the doctors of the ancient world.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of sleep in the early state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, observed in 1861 "a great similarity of confusion with sleep conditions", for Sigmund Freuda was even a dream of "psychosis, nonsense, madness, confusion of thoughts".
It's the summer of 2001, Henning T. is changing into a comical setting.
His body is bi-dimensional and screaming color.
He's got no power over gravity, he's in the room room.
I feel it's over.
He's surrounded by animal breeds with blood red granules, precious teeth.
He beats him, digs into him heavy, fire bottles, smells with him about the wall, feels pain all over the body.
Voice, bad voices threaten the wall and the radio.
He can't smell the voices he gives and smells.
Henning T. throws two cables out of the stereo, puts them in the shirt and trusts her on the hook on the roof.
You're standing on a player and you're wearing a shirt around your neck.
The jumper.
It's a draw.
Learn to raise his voice by cutting his lips, "Go to the clinic and let him be healed!"
Today is Henningu T. 40 years old, he lived six acute psychosis, the last two years, the first almost 20 years ago.
The LSD was dropped.
His diagnosis is a schizophrenia - active paranoia psychosis, plus maniodepressive, seizures against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his own weakness, he's been married for three years.
In psychotics, I've experienced the worst fear and deepest doubts, she says.
The symptoms are terrible.
Almost one percent of people are sick at least once for the life of schizophrenia, and in psychiatric clinics it is the most commonly treated disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of them are no longer able to separate the inner and outer world, resulting in a confused state that can lead to hallucinations, sizes, relative illusions or illusions of tracking.
In particular, hearing voices - voices that express, comment or lead dialogues.
No optical hallucinations are unusual.
A hit is not able to distinguish the importance of the essential, the brain cannot filter negative signals, knowledge is filled with knowledge.
Like the dream of an open psychosis, the deep thought and fantasy that comes from the deepest forms of knowledge.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, top doctor of the Clinic of the University of Heidelberg University Psychiatry.
The Schizophrenic is located in the center of the scene, everything is important to him.
At the same time, it reaches its passive role, becomes, like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot actively form them.
Schizophrenics are often threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Compared with reality, most of them do not have the ability, the miracles are a terrible reality, the entertainment is eliminated.
Once for a lifetime, give birth to hallucinations
Otherwise, as Fuchss says, "there remains a meaningful and spatial structure of reality that man considers to be basically maintained."
Misunderstandings and hallucinations are based on the reality that the transition is in the real context.
Scientists are still standing in front of the lab. Why exactly does our brain do such a thing?
Exceptional attitudes can lead every person to a short-term loss of relationship to reality, says Fuchs.
Not everyone gets into psychosis.
There seems to be genetics available to schizophrenia, but studies in the twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists have concluded that the affected individuals have minimal brain damage.
We believe that in the early stage of development, neuronal brain damage, such as the source disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery when it comes to the deterioration of the neurological system that has never occurred over the years.
Roles also play the effects of the environment - stress or traumatic experiences can be a psychotic initiator if available.
Halucinogenic drugs can also lead to psychosis because they are involved in the transmission system.
When our brain is closed
It's crazy that psychotronics suffer with their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they take expensive medications, others give money for drugs to get them, says professor of psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
If we view mistakes as acceptable or unacceptable, there is often only one question.
Kasten has been collecting news about hallucinations and floods for ten years, in late year he interpreted his results in the book "Die Irreale Welt and our Kapf" (Nerial world in our head).
Hallucination belongs to the typical pathogens of the psychosis, but also to the amazingly many other diseases.
Psychiatric disorders such as limited personality or depression are also common disorders such as migraine, epilepsy, osteoporosis or Alzheimer’s disease.
Surprisingly, it hallucinates for certain conditions and the very brain of a healthy person.
Halucination, according to Kasten, is derived from the content of the thoughts that are normalized.
They occur when parts of the brain in which a sense of thought is being processed are too active or slightly absorbed; if our brain is closed, or if there is no stimulation.
Doctors can leave this condition as much like brain damage or psychosis.
But also the removal of incentives, stress, care with love or other exceptional circumstances.
In more recent studies, up to three thirds of the respondents were told that they had at least once had hallucinations in their lives.
In 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Meklenburg-Mainland and going to a darker gymnasium.
Actually, it's a totally normal girl.
If there weren't those shapes and voices.
It can be said that she has a long, dark hair.
When he answers, his followers look at him with wonder, and no one else will see him and hear him.
This unquenchable girl thinks of a dirty picture, but Sarah K. doesn't know, she knows.
He's upstairs, hearing and seeing that boy, just like he's hearing and seeing a girl sitting next to him in the street.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, my boyfriend likes it.
I'm crazy.
But he knows that this boy and other perverts are not real and disappear again.
At night, there's noises more ringing.
It's often too heavy.
When she sits in the classroom, she can't follow the study several times, because the teacher in her eyes and others just represents a new colleague, but he explains to all the other listener and visible on the mathematical equation table.
At night, the lights are more ringing.
When waiting in his dark room for a bed that comes late, he can't often decide whether he's upstairs or he's asleep, whether the pictures he sees, the grismas, or the girl with bloody arms and legs appear before her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, he's screaming at those posts.
Parents and friends don't say anything about it, they'd think she was crazy.
I'll see you in 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
Vloni made a maturita and lives with his friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations came up.
From the time Kasten's psychologist contacted the Internet, she knew exactly how wrong she was.
Translucency is also an art of appeal
If someone is socially isolated or has been exposed to incentives, he will have a great chance of hallucination, says Kasten.
I guess the brain doesn't have enough employment and he's taking care of his own fun.
Sarah K., the only girl, had a little fear of other children, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she found out at 13 that the man she's been calling from time to time when she thinks she's not her own father.
Because in visual and acoustic hallucinations are active the same brain areas that also process real perceptions and sounds, it's difficult for achieved as Sarah K., to separate from themselves blues and reality. "Every passage," says Kasten, "is playing in the brain, and the reality is also shown there.
Hallucinations are also images that allow the brain to develop, so they actually do."
Night dreams also estimate Kasten as a form of hallucination.
Healthy people's hallucinations are not essentially different from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenics, people’s mental health is able to identify their mistakes as unrealistic.
Casten therefore recommends to his patients that they evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinarily high capacity.
Limitation between sleep and hallucinations
In our world focused too much on science, Imaginary survival is unfortunately largely pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief psychiatrist of the Psychiatric and psychotherapeutic clinic of Florence-Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a difficult, patient disease, but it also brings positive, creativeness - the transition is also art from superstition.
Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the known experience form, especially the form of a changed science to a dream.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams, which the person considers to be real and cannot even distinguish them from the white state.
Oneiroid state of consciousness results in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, for example, by polyradicular disease patients who experience motor protection when fully informed.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, perhaps with a lasting, complete inability to move, replaces life with a threatening real situation by his own, imaginary world, which is linked to reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
The type of bordering state between sleep and hallucination.
Because it's not really possible to manage some situation, it's going to change the world, the real situation, but it's a good idea.
The intensive form of support for ideas and translation of ideas in some unsustainable situation that enables people to develop their own ability to go through the moment to lose their knowledge.
Everything is real, and later in the memories.
The history of art Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his uniroided experiences in his book "Herzechsel" (Translation of the Heart) as a lifesaving action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when a heart attack man with his next transplanted heart was exposed to his knowledge on a few days ’ journey, while his body was constantly lying on an intensive care unit.
Claussen divested into the world he created, visited strange times and places: He becomes an old man lying in bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot watching his health.
He lives in the early middle of the middle of the day between the stomach, which produces bloodless substances.
On the engine, the Rek leads to his own, on the hospital bed, surfes on the farm in Alpach and falls to the Korean mafia.
It's full of imagination, everything's real, and later in memories.
These internal roads are essentially better for Claussen than any dream.
Sen is different, describing his experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of these mental pathways are still clear after years and in some minor details.
Even clearer and more intense than actual survival.
The intensity of this experience divides the horizon of our other real experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, they show the uniroids, psychosis, hallucinations and drug addictions, as the Greeks are also in the white state of our internal images of external reality.
Every change in the state of consciousness, writes psychologist Kasten, "may lead to the deformation of what we call reality."
A reality that can also be fascinating.

Burda
In 27 children are to be placed in custody.
The new leadership of Kallen is a transitional solution: The long-term wishes Hubert Burda to hand over his business into the hands of his two children, said SPIEGEEL.
Holding has to be 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - Nakladator Hubert Burda sees his business long-term in the hands of his children.
Both children will be grandparents at 27 years of age and have a strong desire to enter the company, says a 69-year-old man SPIEGEEL.
We've dealt with it in a thorough manner.
The question whether they are also active in the company will be discussed until then.
And the question is whether they have the ability to do this.
It is not possible to appoint 7500 employees of their children if they are not able enough.
It would kill like children, a business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he had been from the Presidency since January and named Paul-Bernhard Kallena as his successor.
Kallen, 52 years old, has been a member of the Burdy Presidency since 1999.
First of all, he had technology.
Later, the Cokodna also added responsibility for the owners of the company and, after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfera, the First Marketing, Cizina, Print and Finance.
First, none of the family members are in charge.
Burd's child is 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Callena's name also serves to "caught 10, 15 years," Burd said.
Holding should be 100 percent of the family in the future, says Burd.
In view of the case of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burd said that even family businesses have no confidence in the record: "It has always been a company that lets touch after the capital that they speculated and thought they could become big players.
It was never my strategy.
He never had "the dream of world power," says Burd.
I don't care about this country's political preceptor, like Springer, and I don't want to play the world league with "Time", these businesses are too big.

Endesa and Barcelona, with electric motor
The Energy Company of Endes, together with the Barcelona branch, established the 'Canal of LIFE'.
It is a project for the development and operation of an electric car in the capital of Catalánska.
The LIVE' (Logistics for the launch of electric cars) will establish and direct the roadmap for the launch of electric cars in the city and ensure the mobility agreement, will be organized, coordinated and pre-introduction, etc.
It will also develop MOVELE project, promote electric cars, collect views and results of activities in the sectors involved.
However, the aim is to support this means of transport for the future.
3 'Electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city that is involved in the project of the launch of electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also join the project.
It's three cities that have chosen the government under the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric cars.
The Energy Company has already signed a framework agreement with the Italian government.
The aim is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan autonomous area.
This includes energy-related activities and in particular energy efficiency.
It is not a single initiative with the participation of Andesy regarding the transmission of electric cars.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and actively implements a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a 'climate period' in the car industry.
President José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish car industry, the main export sector of the state, is waiting for a "climate period".
In the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009 Zapatero outlined measures taken during the year to support the car sector.
"Without a competition plan for the car industry, we would be expected today to be released, to close some of our main manufacturing companies," the president of the government said.
"In view of this plan and the desire to continue to move to Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of rest in this industry, which is our main export sector, is expected to be in the future," he added.
In this regard, he pointed out that the competitive plan, which forms part of the Integrated Car Sector Plan (PIA), has identified 800 million projects for 19 producers and 137 subsidiary companies that have mobilized investments of EUR 3 billion.
The President explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernisation of production and existing processes.
Mr Zapatero also highlighted the government's support measures and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is used in cooperation with autonomous areas and car brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed a 6% reduction in average emissions in new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and has ensured a "significant increase" of records, in particular in November of "40%".
20,000 square metres of classical vehicles
In Madrid the first International Hall of Classic Vehicles will be opened, which is a place to meet professionals and amateurs from the world of motors.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Skelened Pavilion of the Madrid Casa de Campo.
This is a 20 000-metre surface area of square metres, where more than 200 Turkish and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but also in ClassicAuto Madrid products of all types related to the world of engines.
The exhibitors will offer accessories, replacement parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, publications, thumbnails, etc.
Components of products related to classic engines, actual refrigerators for collectors and experts.
Among the companies involved will be:Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, renewal; Coupe-Françoiso Pueche, sales and renewal of cars; or Cochera Classicos, specialized company Mercedes Benz.
Experimental test
In addition, the commercial activities of this hall will be complemented by parallel activities such as focusing, sports performance, testing, presentations and competition.
They will also be carried out tests of the ability of classic cars and motorcycles in a suitable area outside the exhibition area.
Mazda3 i-Stop: maintenance of the sport style
Perhaps she will show that the environment has no negative impact on the sport style.
And that's why Mazda3 has a built-in stopping system and engine start - also baptized as-Stop- which is a device that is currently available only with a petrol engine 2.0 150 horses.
This second generationMazda3 is characterized by the good characteristics that have reached it as a whole.
Surface repair, vehicle operation, citizenship, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in Mazda3.
The previous seat, etc. the driver's seats have excellent ergonomics and are well-fashioned.
Volant is also extremely nice.
With the tools and consoles, we will conclude that Mazda continues in the Japanese trend in the development of a futuristic design with many buttons and controllers and an excellent red and blue color.
This style partially reminds us of the style that is also presented by Honda Civic.
So we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese and German, are contrasting the floods of German products and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which all want to win.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than a sufficient space for four adults who enjoy a very comfortable ride.
In addition, we need to mention the large backbone space and regular shapes.
The automatic stop and start of the engine is currently available only with a petrol engine on two litres and 150 horse-powered hand-held axle.
This engine is a real ice cream. It's very nice, marked by a low-fated calculus, its performance and its lower consumption.
Although the most demanding Mazda3 is in the version of diesel, all those who do not travel so many kilometers a year should not exit this i-Stop with a petrol engine, as it is marked with greater comfort when driving and reduced consumption.
With regard to equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
In a series of equipment, it is necessary to mention the above system of monitoring of train brakes (RVM), which protects the sound of the dead ear, control of mind and stability, control of speed, internal mirror sensitive to the light, a large-scale computer with a large screen, parking reader, independent air conditioning, a flood sensor and a lighter, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and car from 17palc cylinders.
And if the equipment is not available, this version has been equippedPack Premium, with an additional 1,500 euros: adjustable lighting of doublexenon and sound system BOSE with CD holder, except for other parts.
End
Magda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in your category.
It shall be characterized in particular by the quality of the materials used, its operation and high level of equipment.
And more people who don't travel more than a mile a year can choose this i-Stop version, which is only with a petrol engine 2.0 and 150 horses.
The only non-exhaustive model is its highest price, making €21.770 for the launch of Luxury and €23.270 for the tested version -Sportive-.
For this high price, Mazda3 offers a large dose of rest for each day.
Luxury 'Première'

Slib FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, only serves to visit mail, without the possibility of viewing a particular type of attachment or surfing the network.
He used his five minutes of fame in the United States when her Time magazine evaluated her as one of the products of the year.
It's harder to see her outside, but that idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is marked with a very low price and monthly payments, less than half of which is paid for the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began to offer two new devices: one was only intended for Twitter, the other, on the basis of which the free data services were provided, which, however, needed to be paid for Peek’s sixteenth amount.
FonPeek, who was represented on Le Web yesterday, is a European version of the invention and at the same time a third of its changes.
He's just as limited as his American rival, but he's making a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price makes about 12 euros a month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People traveling with smartphones already know what it means to come up with data services after crossing the border or to look for a coffee shop with WiFi (or a Front connection) to be able to look for mail.
The event with a high price roaming is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced for a long time.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but my experience shows that a person would need a doctor from physics to understand them, and also a very good mirror to be able to read a miniature letter.
The European Commission continues to call for a reduction in roaming tariffs so that they can be made available for Europe as a whole, which is still not affected.
There is reason to be concerned about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that a device such as FonPeek (is interesting that it still has the name of Fon without Wifi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators start thinking differently and consider various offers that would compensate their network.
Kindle is another beautiful example, offers book collection and other online search.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and is paid at the time of purchase, never after months.
And that's exactly what I expect to happen once in the case of FonPeek, it's about the possibility of buying with a sustainable approach like that Peek has already been introduced in the United States.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm looking over the phone, thank you.
I expect it because I think it's from the point of view of the best consumer.
It would be interesting if this system could be used in computers.
Color to use for Michelle
Gold is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first ladies in the United States.
To get Barack Obama to the role of President of the United States, she chose dress and coffee in this color, and she also chose the same color when she attended her second most important moment of her life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to being a similar color - glutened with tributary effects - in both cases it was a complete complete set of clothes, bags and cassettes with the same substance-adjusted with a large height or threshold.
At first glance, it seemed that the first lady in the United States decided to go to the steps of the Assyrian princess and wear a similar dress.
The product from which the clothes are made makes both models very different.
On the chance of access to Michelle's function, she used a large plot in Osla with pressure.
Changes and additions: green boots with medium high bottom, similar model, but in gold color.
It also carries various pieces: this time droid, before the hair is released.
75% of working mothers have work problems related to maternity.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially in women of young age who are willing to raise a child.
This is the result of the study 'Fruitness and career of Spanish Women' which was conducted by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The study involved 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 years and the results are unique: 75% of working mothers have limited employment opportunities due to maternity.
The study stresses that at the beginning of the partnership, there are many differences in the views of the number of children according to whether they work or not, and also by the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or have no stable jobs, start living with a partner before the birth of the first child, and have more children at all.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, partner relations and matrimony, and have fewer offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 years of stable employment have the first child in the middle of 3.7 years from the beginning of their relationship with the partner. This figure is 4.1 for women whose stable employment has paid most of their lives and therefore had to leave partnership and children's income.
The type of call also has a strong effect on maternal health, although less impact on the duration of contact with the partner," explains Margarita Delgado, who is committed to research in the CSIC.
Another factor affecting women’s age at the time of the closure of the marriage of the birth of anarrhythmias is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age when women marry and have their first child.
There are also differences among women of the same generation.
For example, in age groups 35 to 49 years of age, women were born with basic and higher education of their first child at 25.1 years of age, e.g. 32.1.
"There is still another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women get married with basic education and give birth to their first child even before they find a stable job, while women act with medium or high education give serious priority to obtaining stable employment, before marriage and the birth of the first child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger also stands for it.
L'Oréal Paris just added a new name to his prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
From the next year, the German heretic will become the form of various products of this sign under the universal word 'Because I stand for it'.
The representative of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most impenetrable heroes of the international level, thus adds to another famous personality of L'Oréal Paris such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Funda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spain Penélope Cruz.
Even before her, they entered this selected group of heretics Evangeline Lilly and Freida Pinto ("Millions of the Chatter").
The French part of this cosmetic brand is also represented by the important characters: Patrick Dempsey ('Greova Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Egangelin's "Estroken's" partner).
Prices of British methods
Brits have a lot to talk about.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, former and now - met at the annual price presentation held in London at the Royal Court os Justice.

Poker Manuela Vicente
Manuel Vicent presents thirty X-ray photos of writers with whom he met in his literary life (and in some cases even in ordinary life).

This book is an excellent reader experience, even when repeated reading.
I'm going to give you some clues.
About Albert Camus: "I found on the pages of this book that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, like what I feel, but you can't name it: a life of anti-civility, a moral, without guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and no intelligence, something between weakness and ignorance, with an obvious poetic humor, without meaning, as if it were a knife that killed her a little bit."
About Graham Green: "Our man was assigned to this woman after thirty years of age, curiosity, shame and excitement, which is a spiritual excuse for reaching the sky by a way of ruin."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssea was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the osmetic peaks in universal literature, which is necessary to be overcome by the north, from which these best hotlers will often get away."
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
He told himself that he was the grandfather of the crew, and that he was the son of a black crocodile.
In both cases, there was a major dream."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer has captured this man's reputation in the bridge from Munich to bring his speech into his literary form in the night of the 20th century, running before him and calling to the future and the wise speaking to the greens."
About Dorothy Parker: "One time she cried and prayed: 'My dear God, let me stop writing like a woman.'
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were the words of Spencer: 'After the effort, the dream comes,/ after the storm of peace,/after the war of rest,/after a full life of death."
About Virginia Wolf: "He also carried his depression in his engagements.
The husband fully agreed to tell him that Eduard VII was watching her in the amalgams or that the birds were singing the river.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness."
About Pío Baroia: "What else did Martin Santos do before focusing on Joyce on Baroë?
What else did Benet do before he let Barojo fix Faulkner's weapon?
What is the matter with Zul-Qarnain, that he does not glorify himself for the glory of this man?"
Absorbing aggression
Last week my seventy-year-old mother passed our fourth, during the Fuenlabrad era, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 years have had a seizure and our dog, a cross that was saved from a weight attack of up to six kilograms, without a single word touching her twice and seriously injured.
Our confusion is more about seeing nothing fun in such aggression against a small and vulnerable animal that was also on the ledge.
And for that, after the incident, the old lady, when she went through with this individual, began to fear her own safety, for such a demon possessed man who would attack the animal is capable of doing the same thing as a woman, a child, an old man or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, on Tuesday, usually in a quiet quarter.
The dog's been prowling all day.
Of course, we had a problem with the nearest Commissioner, but we suspect that this was something, and so that we don't raise the cold questions, we find these horrible killings to be Spanish people.
It's enough for us to announce this reality.
We do not understand what is happening to today’s youth when it comes to the suffering of defenseless animals that give us love, company, and friendship.
We don't understand where the right behavior is divided, respect for animals and humans.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helm
The manufacturer of Michelin tyres in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Service (Fesvial) launched a campaign to support the use of helm, especially in younger motorists, as both entities reported today.
The purpose of this initiative is to highlight the importance of using helmets, as it is the only means to prevent head injuries and deaths when accidents occur on the motorcycle.
Michelin states that this campaign is part of their transport security commitments, which "meaning more than proposing and producing even safer products", and has confirmed that it is trying to achieve this objective in other ways as an educational and information campaign.
This new campaign to support the use of helmets on motorcycles, under the title 'To be or not to be', is the first phase, when more than 500 motorcycles will be set up in order to reach the highest public awareness.
And in conclusion, Michelin pointed out that transport safety "is a permanent problem" of this company, which is the manufacturer of tyres for double vehicles and its main aim is to increase the safety of products permanently.
Increased sales of light commercial vehicles
Almost two years later, the market for light-use vehicles begins to be reminiscent of it.
All 9,425 vehicles reported in November in Spain indicated an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and more than the first increase after 22 months of permanent accident, according to the data provided by Anfac and Ganva producers' parental organisation.
However, it is better to give credit to quarantine as November 2008 is a very bad time for comparison and meant a 60% reduction compared with the previous year.
As a result, regardless of the rise in the last month, the total number of vehicles reported in the last 11 months is less than 40% than in the previous accounting year.
From January 95.853 vehicles were sold, which includes all possible vehicles belonging to the category of light commercial vehicles: personal cars, pick ups, supplies, less expensive cars and light trucks/cars.
And they did not disappear, even those who are most in harm's way, although they bought private persons, most of the purchases were carried out by smaller and medium-sized companies, and almost 100% of the cases are financing through third-party.
Further factors such as the cessation of activities or the continuation of a bad economic situation should be added to the restriction resulting from the closure of the bank credit source.
In that situation, the aid for the purchase of 2000E was not too helpful in the case of personal vehicles.
In addition to private persons, it is necessary to mention business operators in the small and medium-sized enterprises that are willing to buy a light-use vehicle up to 3.5 tonnes of CO2-free carbon-free volume of 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
At the same time yesterday, Ganvam was reminded again that special attention should be paid to the handling of these vehicles as well as industrial vehicles (cylons and buses).
The association of sellers assumes that in 2010 there will be a trend similar to that in the number of individual vehicles and that 4x4 is equal to 19%.
The emergency emergency system is already a necessary equipment.
As in the case of the ABS anti-locking system, this will also be done with the management of the stability of the ESP, which helps hand-held systems, all of which will be responsible for the provision of European vehicles.
In fact, it is already part of the obligation to provide all new self-propelled cars and light-use vehicles, while in the rest, a deadline is set for the removal of the deficiency, which is in February 2011.
The EU measures are aimed at increasing the protection of passengers, which is so effective that it can help prevent many conflicts.
The assistive system of manual speeds increases the pressure on the brakes in the emergency case, which the system will detect when the driver is moving.
But he can't always keep this pressure to the end.
According to a study carried out by Bosch car manufacturers, three and a half drivers who have an accident did not have an accident before the war, and half of them did not take full advantage of the force of the storm.
Up to 1,100 accidents
However, this aid requires the maximum speed system, reducing the speed of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU alone, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of device, up to 1,100 fatal accidents could be avoided annually related to the driver.
The reduction of this number will be even more significant, according to the calculations, to prevent one out of four accidents with an impact on people-by introducing so-called intelligent systems of manual speeds.
In this case, the vehicle shall be equipped with a system which (with a radar or cameras) captures obstacles and is a driver other than a light speed.
If the driver reacts, it can help him increase pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If the driver does not respond and even if the driver cannot be prevented, the device shall cause the less intense wind and reduce the risk of damage to the minimum.
General Motors download plans for Opel to ice
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, the employees of Opel in Figuerueles (Zaragos) that the production of new Meriva will begin in the first week of the month of deep - probably 8 April - as Javier Ortega reported, the American manufacturer warns that more time will be needed to complete the Opel recovery plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to make every point of the plan agreed first with the party concerned.
As a result, the final document, which will be submitted first to employees and then to the governments of the individual countries in which the production industry is located, may be issued by the early 2010 deadline.
However, GM ensures that the Saab sales decision should be taken in these days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American producer to make certain decisions first.
GM enables contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also prefers to acquire Volvo, but takes into account the possibility of a Dutch manufacturer of skiper sports vehicles, which is operating under the protection of the Russian Converg group.
If it is not possible to agree with any of them, GM would be able to sell some of the assets of Saab of the Chinese Baic company.
She's still paying to decide to close Saab by the end of the year if she can't sell it.
Horse with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In developing this quality model, engineers from Porsche used Boxster S as a basis and managed to reduce weight by 80 kg, so your weight shows only 1.275 kg.
On the basis of the first line, the automatic lifting of the beam was in a paid manual exercise with a volume of 21 kg; further use of the lighthouse door, such as GT3, which means 15 kg less; the removal of the air conditioning, 13; the reduction of fuel maintenance from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to a reduction of other 7 kg; after the installation of the sports seats of another 12 kg, thanks to the removal of the 19palc bicycles five kilos.
Finally, the removal of the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less and the replacement of the door doors with textile tapes means another kilogram.
Also offered with a two-wheel drive PDK, one vehicle with a hand-held six-step speed shield was tested, mainly on the roads of the second class in California, on the mountain peaks with many online assaults.
His behavior can only be qualified as impeccable.
The reduction in volume does not mean that the vehicle is non-inspired to the asphalt.
It's quite the opposite: we haven't tested so little and easy model for a long time, which would also bring such security at the time of the attack, even at high speeds.
It's a small athlete capable of burning the candles during a short ride after the necessary time until we're ordering the sprint, winding, and re-use of the engine...
Whatever we want, the procedure that is so communicative as exact, whatever we sign hands on the wheel, is what the car does.
And he does it with surgical precision.
The sound of the engine according to the will
The V6 boxer sound of 320 horses (over 10 more than Boxster S) is a great performance and it is possible to enable 'port' and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine that was previously used in Panama.
The ability to accelerate is brutal, whether already in situ or recovery.
They're strong, but they're neither hard nor comfortable.
The asphalt train that we're going through with Boxster Spyder was pretty destroyed, but the car managed well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the journey; in some cases, we were hit by lightning and lightning even in the morning.
Definitely this ultra-year train is one of the most fun on the market, since it's more about something than just modifying Boxster S.
The car will be marketed in February 2010 at EUR 70,831.
'Bag Girl'
Friends Karl Lagerfelda, the icon of the Coco Cocoon series and the possible 'starlette' on the views of 'fellows', the singer introduces his face of evil girls as closely as his cables Chanel.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
The Bascona won the victory in Israel
The working crew won a brilliant victory in 82-91 at its guest on the complicated Maccabi Electra plant, despite the considerable absence of Duska Ivanovice, and thus reached the top of its group after the great release of Mirzy Teletovic, which with eight third points was the best statement in the company (29 reviews).
The company Vitorie has been able to compensate for the significant incompatibility of Herrmann, Ollesona, Huertase or Micov with a high dose of detection and collective work, even though it had to endure to the end in order to win.
In addition, the vast accuracy of the area was much shared by 16 trio points in the final triumph.
The game began with a head for blues who had been placed on the mark from the beginning.
That the first four horns for Vitoria were from a distance, which indicated that they were very strong against Israel’s society.
English and Teletovic belonged between the main 18-20 shots at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alavic society decided for the inner game of Barac and Elijah's work, which was adopted by fishing and by returning to its original destination to increase the benefit before the start of the stop (34-43).
Teletovic has already begun to act as the best in his company with 13 points, although 'without six' when it was evaluated by Splitter already indicated that it would not be the best evening for Brazil.
But although the game was sharp to the stop, it was not decided either in the least and in the Maccabees they wanted to remind Victoria that everyone on their roof would not win, and 'the hand of Elijah' could win.
Eidson and Pnini have definitely contributed to the return of the 'jolts' to the statement (50-49).

Ivanovic’s members, injured but not dead, needed a few direct cures to recover the breath, and then appeared at Mirza Teletovic’s funeral, which was three-thirds after him and with the help of English and Ribase, which reached local at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavs sat on the skin in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) had already announced that they would not allow anyone to prepare for the deserved results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their marriage, did not give up and tried to keep the society alive from the three points (70-77).
Despite this and with the Splitter, who was released for the Faul Sevanovic, they did not recover and defend well, and while the Israelites approached the final minute (80-85), the game had already won and the Tel Aviv won first for the season.
Victims are unable to fight Unica
The Unicija has played a great role in Greece with Olympics and has left the leadership of Group B in Eurolyz, which was marked by three attacks by the Unica, but in particular the inner game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which has facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malagian society did not find peace and friendship between Paul and opposers, perhaps one of the most ills in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed Andalusan to sleep. Aggressive defense and three third points after themselves, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillema Rubia, revealed the heat from 12-18, minutes 9.
Olympiacos was amazed at the intensity of Unica , although the arsenal of the locals in the inner game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanits, surrounded the score 22-20, minutes 13, which was the moment when the battle between defenses with USABeverley and Williams meant that both players were expelled.
The Greek society began to function and showed its movement in two areas where the absence of English pivot due to the injury of Joel Freeland and three personal errors of Carlos Jiménez made it difficult for the United Nations.
Between the inner players and the Lithuanian square of Linas Kleizas with the three points increased the benefit to 44-32, minutes 19.
Can not get folder: %s: %s
The third part was very attacking by Olympics, who, despite having lost 19, had shown a movement and was even able to resolve the difference between the game in Malálaga 66-48, 27 minutes, which gained leadership in the group.
Unica tried to overcome the absence and the latest incompatibility of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
Despite all the failures of Unica, thanks to the leadership and the three-point Cook and Lewis' contribution, she had a certain hope in the prize 66-57, minutes 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympics, thanks to the strength and passage of the centimetres in their area, proved that it was unstoppable.
The Croatian beer Nikola Vujcic, achieved the exact equivalent of an average of 81-62, minutes 37, and Unicija called and handed over Olympiacos's leadership.
How much should you charge for your profile on Facebook?
Facebouk users can meet the pay that deserves for their profile, thanks to the new Trovit app, looking for the largest number of classed interns in the area of reality, employment and motor vehicles in Spain.
The tool How much do you need to take? The user's payments are calculated on the basis of more than 140.000 jobs available in Trovit, Spain, using a form available to Facebook, where you need to enter professions, years of experience, age and city where you can work.
During the week that the application works, the searcher found that the Spanish worker generally "feels badly rewarded", explained in his report Albert Rivera, responsible for the product Trovit.
According to the data available to Trovit from its searchers in Great Britain and France, Spain is the highest payment.
The British programmer is €45.226 gross annually and the French 31.059, while Spain gets 24,000.
Similarly, the driver pays 34.247 euros a year in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, Spain has the highest payroll job of EUR 11,592 per year, followed by a salesman of EUR 14,725 and a dealer of EUR 15,667.
The most sought employment on the network in the last three months is driver, employee and social worker.
Brazil has set the date of Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has established the duration of the stay of Manuel Zelayi on his voyage to Tegucigalpė.
The President of the session shall no later than 27 January 2010, when he officially terminates his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, a Brazilian businessman in the capital of Honduras, confirmed for TV Globe that "Mel" knows he has to leave the embassy where he has been hiding since September 21.
"I know that on January 27th, after completing my term of office, I have to go and look for other shelter."
The station also quoted an former state official who had confirmed his intention to leave a long time ago: "I intend to go as far as first, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government," Zelaya phoned.
After the elections on 29 November (when Porfirio Lobo was elected) Zelaya made sure that she stayed in Brazil until winter.
However, that week he was trying to get an ambulance in Brazil.
The operation ended because Zelaya rejected the political asylum condition that he was trying to impose on him by the government "de facto", which President Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After days of wine and roses from the past, when the active inflation represented a dominant trend on the markets, there was a uncertainty on the markets again, which should not be surprising, because it is already a natural state in the environment where managers make decisions about the future that is uncertain about themselves.
The drug used by central banks to stabilise the market was reduced by the direct purchase of assets and the indirect release of liquidity in the course of the near zero, so that the financial institutions could buy assets for the calculation.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct acquisitions of assets have already been virtually completed and, without doubt, their unsound liquidity policy has begun to capture some sand in the vicinity, as the Spanish Central Bank has done with its auction in the last year.
Investors are therefore concerned about the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are taking part in a return to lowering risks.
The mobility of the storm and the differences in the debt companies again gained points, although they are still very far from the abnormal levels reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risks, which again affected public debt.
Once again, it focuses on quality, and the US, Japan and Germany have become the target of selected investors, which has widened the differences between the euro area countries against Germany.
This unstable Spanish was almost unsatisfied, but at the time Standard & Poor's arrived and threatened a new revision of the decline in the qualifications of the Spanish Empire.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty is not useful to conceal the remaining moral risk who have again tried to force awareness of those responsible for the world's economic policy on the grounds of distortion of any consequences of the restriction of employment when a new day of prayer should be announced.
However, the situation in Dubai represents a kind of war between the emiries on the renewal of power in immigrants, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen it before.
A government that covers deficits, elections and a new government is emerging.
He did this in Italy after Berluscon and Socrates in Portugal after Durao Barroso.
It does not mean that Ecofin will save Hungary from the failure of foreign payments at the beginning of the year and will allow the euro Member State to fulfil its obligations.
However, it is logical that Ecofin should give the Greek government the transparency and commitment of its own citizens to joint responsibility when there is a need for exceptional measures to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, as we expect, we are facing a period of normalisation of premiums from the transitional risk, after some surpluses in supported positions would be within the framework of expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase, as will the debt of European companies, we need not worry.
If Europe's differences are decreasing and ours will continue to expand, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The issue of Standard & Poor's is only anecdot. When our previous indicators encourage most of the study services to introduce their re-scans and review their scenarios by 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, it is a great hope for the Spanish economy to experience the fulfillment of this warning.
Again, it seems that it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even though in the meantime "carefully, friends of drivers".

President Iberdrol Ignacio Sánchez Galán, as the first one yesterday, intervened in front of the Under-Commission, where the Spanish energy strategy is currently under way in the next two decades.
Following his intervention, following the appearance of President Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafaela Villasecy, Galán provided a number of comments on the proposal that he presented to the subcommittees at the closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs investment of EUR 50,000 million by 2020 and another 60,000 million from that date by 2030 if nuclear power is maintained, which are currently in operation.
If that hadn't happened, the necessary investments would not be 60,000 million or 95,000 million.
Iberdrol believes that investment in the next decade must not be aimed at increasing production capacity, rather than distribution networks and international mergers.
The issue has changed since 2020 and will have to be increased.
Its offer focuses on the gas and wet electricity with the carbon capture mechanism and especially on renewable energy.
In this case, it is considered that there is a need for new 18,000 MWs, as well as other 'supportable energy'.
Galan, who is considered to be a woman of the law on a sustainable economy that has just been adopted by the government, is in line with what the company has requested, did not want to leave life as a royal decree in support of the consumption of national coal, which is opposed to the policy against climate change.
In his view, "a clear long line" is in this sense, despite the "extraordinary" measure, as President Iberdrol called it.
Whatever it is, Galan is believed that investment decisions, even if they are long-term, must be taken now because their monitoring takes place and a stable tax framework is needed for their initiation.
Ferravial wins 'action' Air Lingus on 10 Latvians
The daughter of Ferrovial for the Land Service, Switzerland Swiss Company, will play the role of the Irish Aer Lingus Preferred Aeroliner for cost services in ten European airports, where she is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels belong to most of them.
The agreement that has not yet fulfilled the economic terms has been valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Castile-La Mancha and University in Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a cooperation protocol on the establishment of the Centre for the Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures
The association estimates the investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% belong to Ferrovial.
One of the medium-term tasks will be the research of energy efficiency in the distance and airport.
Action strengthens its first route to Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Akiona is fighting for her first concession to Australia, which is a market where she already works as an energy and water business.
The position of the tunnel is estimated at $1,700 million in Australia (about €1,047 million).
Its opponents are the French company Bouygues and the German Hottief.
The five-mile tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast became the closest opportunity to take action in this country as a construction and concessional remote undertaking.
The workshop will have a tunnel completed at the end of 2014
Following the selection of public-private cooperation (PPP according to the original English) for further development of the project in the business plan protected by Erns & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the construction and operation of the mine.
It is expected that tenders will be submitted in the month of May, and the projected investment will reach $1,700 million (EUR 1,047 million) and in the final phase of the competition three groups with significant presence in European buildings.
A group called Transcity is led by Akiona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghela.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies and the second with Italy's headquarters is one of the largest European specialists in the underground building.
Against the Action Group, the Group of Northern Direct is in the game with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction team Bouygues.
The third and last group that has gone through the network has the name LBRJV and shares it with the Australian capital Lighton (the daughter of the German construction company Hochtief, here represented by the ACS), as well as the location of Baulderstone (the property of the German Bilfinger Berger) and a significant company specialized in the civil building of Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises big buildings and privatization, but it presents a clear difficulty to enter in a way other than through the acquisition of local construction companies.
The strategies referred to in Hochtiff or Bilfinger are still an example of Spanish giants in the sector, in addition to Asian references.
The ACS received a market position by 30 % of its share in Hochtief, owned by Leighton.
Milliseconds
The action is based on the geographical area with the greatest importance for the sector, where it already has significant presence through its energy suppliers and in the settlement business.
Despite the other assets, it has the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and leads a group of companies that set up and repair the settlement facilities in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use joint energy for access to the building and infrastructure.
The underground road facing the mine, which is the promotional site of the city of Brisbane, with the name Northern Link (Northern Link), is connected to the western road from Toowong with the district route in Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 km of the tunnel. It is the largest operation to reduce the transport burden of Brisbane.
The timetable for the local administration shall be scheduled for 2010 and the start of work on December of the following year.
Although this paid drive would be opened in the last months of 2014, complete completion of the work will be planned until 2016.
The tunnel began to design in 2005.
It will contain two inputs in each direction, an electronic waste system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its funding.
Brisbane has already offered this order Hochtief
Australia continues to make a significant profit because yesterday it announced a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
The ACS splits through its local branch Lighton infrastructure of the national broadband network with cables from the optical train.
This situation will allow 400,000 people to access the Internet quickly and will provide work for 18 months of German society.
On the other hand, the company abandoned the project of construction of the King George castle with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction work had to be started first and Hochtief had to close the sale of more than 129 million.
In Great Britain, in particular in Manchester, he will share with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC has been allocated a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, received the allocation of the tunnel building of 2.1 km for the distance in Slovenia at EUR 64.5 million.
The company obtained a contract a few days after working on the expansion of the tunnel in Bosruk, Russia, for 130 million.
This way Alpine strengthens its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of work is scheduled for early 2010 and the duration of implementation is 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore got a promotion in Renfe
Renfe provided advertising and marketing services for the last two years by Sr. Rushmore agency for about three million euros a year, informed the company of the railways.
The contract contains a 12-month extension each year. Ms. Rushmore was elected among the 16 agencies who presented themselves in the competition with Renfe, of which four were finalised, among them TBWA, responsible for making advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be looking forward to the promotion and production of the campaign.
63 million for France Télécom to speed up competition
The competition regulatory authority in France has placed a total of EUR 63 million in France for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean, which belongs to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited the competition of strong and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programmes that were used at the end of the regulation.
This former French monopoly and the still state company purchased more than EUR 560 million from 1994 for imputing obstacles to their competitors.
The loan lodged yesterday was de facto raised because the competition authority is believed to have allowed France Télécom a similar procedure as in the past and thus to be reciprocal.
Trade in applications
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company is still a star between other operators and has opened up a trade with Internet applications with a view to increasing revenues that will not result from voice transfers.
Since the beginning, trade with Orange applications will be active in France and Great Britain.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for accession to other countries such as Spain.
The game in the league of Champions has brought from the beginning 476.4 million Madrid and Barce
The League of Masters has been a source of revenue for these clubs since its birth in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have produced 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth most profitable club in the competition.
The list is seen by Manchester United.
The list is seen by Manchester United.
The victory of the UEFA Masters League does not only bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for large clubs.
To that end, the competition has allocated EUR 5,362.5 million between 105 companies (from 12 Spanish) participating in this event since the 1992/1993 tournament, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona came out of this department very well.
The white club was the third on the continent with the most money he got to participate, and the only one with AC Milan that won three times the main price.
The current Catalan champion and the final victory of the lost Europe Hall in 1992 is in the fifth category.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich Bayern, two companies that also counted the most money to participate in the past master League.
And it's just that she lost both of them with Barço.
On the other hand, Spain is the third country that has received the most money through the Championships, although it has won the most title of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This seeming paradox is explained by a complex procedure for the distribution of money used by UEFA.
In this accounting year, the institution to which Michel Platini is president, is planning to generate 1.090 million for the Champions League.
From these UEFA money, UEFA owes 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs participating in the pre-classification car (also called Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition to those who had participated, only 3.8 million were held for their presence, plus EUR 550,000 for each party participating.
There is also a prize for the prize (800,000 euros) and for the prize (400,000 for each company). Osmiffinlists will get three million each; eight quarter-finalists will be 3.3 million.
Each of the last four will get four million.
He's making 9 million champions while the second finalist is 5.2 million.
This will make a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million on solid payments to the club.
On the other hand, Barça received 2.5 million for victory in the European superpower in August.
In addition, there are mobile payments for 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the relative value of each television market.
Spain is one of the main and has four designated places.
The last year's champion will receive 40% of the money allocated, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of games played this year.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29,9% Sos
The Nueva Rumas Group announced yesterday the details of the offer to buy shares, with which he wants to get a top position between 25% and 29.9% of Sos capital.
This percentage does not depend on the making of public tenders for the purchase (optional) of all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros for shares that would be paid in ten years and for which the rate would be paid for this discount1% per year.
Yesterday's stock Sos finished trading at €1.85; so the offer of Nueva Rumas is valued by the company by 18% under market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa price 1,50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer shall be subject to the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Council.
The Irish group provides 15 days to notify shareholders of their interest in selling.
CMMV stated that it was not informed of the offer, although Ruize Matthews confirmed that he had joined the regulatory authority.
If the purchase is carried out, the price would reach 611.7 million, while Sos capitalisation is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, he further changes the structure of his leadership.
As an attempt to maintain possible bids for the purchase and balance of the judicial training of his former leaders, the brothers of Jesus and Jaime Salazar were notified of the choice of Marie Luisy Jordá as head of internal audit.
This decision shall be made by the first woman who has a high role in the food business.
It's about a new place that's going to be directly under the chairmanship of the group.
And it's not out of politics, as the company continues to be disappointed in the legal battle for a certain transfer of more than 230 million from the Sos of the Salazar brothers.
De facto cannot draw the possibility that in the coming months, Sos will detect new transfers of funds
As regards Salazar's credit, yesterday the members of the Governing Council of Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unica) said that they had accepted a transfer of 212 million without knowing where to appoint them.
CMMV allows options for the exemption of Pateriny, who participated in Investor Mer
yesterday, the National Commission for the Market of Prices (CNMV) granted an exemption in favour of Investor Mer, against Federic Paterninov on 9 October.
The Authority explained that it allowed this operation, since it understood that its conditions were in accordance with the applicable rules, and considered that the contents of the explanations were "sufficient" submitted after the amendments made on 2 December.
CMMV pointed out that the offer is aimed at obtaining 550,008 shares of Federica Paterini at a price of 7,65 euros per share, representing 8,95% of the company's capital, which is created by 6,142,786 shares accepted for trading in the boars in Madrid and Bilbau.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares were abandoned, which would not be able to be transferred in any way until the tender, which specified that the price was fixed by Federic Paterin in accordance with the provisions of the payment standards.
New Automotive Assessment Tools
In these days, storm and accident are not just self-services.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a certain event are transferred to a service where the expert has to estimate the damages and costs of repair.
No reliable event is equal to the cost of work and working time can be long and hard work.
To calculate manually the cost of adjustment from 20,000 to 30,000 euros, including parts and labour force, may take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, this would be a minute question.
That's why almost 100% of researchers use this kind of system.
The providers of services and solutions for the analysis of certain events and maintenance shall be required to collect information provided by manufacturers to develop and offer to their customers a useful tool.
In Spain Audadex, from the American Solera group is a leading company; 80% of the evaluation is carried out with its products.
Other companies that compete in the field of evaluation and development of sector information tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The processing of data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, trade director Audatex, they work in Spain with 63 producers and importers and each of them provides information in a different format.
In addition, the number of data for processing continues to grow, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been mentioned in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as a new vehicle enters the market, these companies will start working.
It's a very hot job because each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle needs to be catalogued and set its price.
In addition to each model, "intelligent" graphic processing is carried out, where it is possible to "swift" individual parts of tourist vehicles.
With regard to the model of mass sales, the work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
In the case of a mining car, it may last for three or four months. At present, Audadex has full information about 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models with information are Porsche, but for example not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the train park, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the work of documenting and developing the database, Audadex has eight mediums distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in particular features.
The national seat is in Alcobendas, Madrid.
There are more than a hundred techniques (normally experts) working with three computer screens.
Audadex invests EUR 90 million annually to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are collected and customers get updates every two days.
The processing of this unambiguous flow of information enables businesses to use and provide different products.
The most common use focuses on repair and maintenance, but according to individual countries, there are also tools to manage repair parts or to calculate the sales or maintenance value of the car.
The only company available to the driver informing about the value of the vehicles used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audadex is not available in our country, but in the United States it is.
With regard to products offered by Audadex, it is easy to obtain support that professionals can use in the sector.
This company offers ten different instruments, while the star product is AudaPlus, the standard solution for the assessment of certain events determined by the expert.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the costs for the parts, it also includes the time to correct the estimated manufacturer or the lamp.
This tool shall be paid according to the use for each assessment.
The highest price is €5.75 for customers who use it at least 10 times a month.
Then every insurance that carries out thousands of payments will match its price with Audadex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow full identification of vehicles and devices with which they have come out of the assembly line only on the basis of the first number of vehicles.
AudaGlass is focusing on the glass of vehicles and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet, which enables the production of vehicles with overall certainty.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or detecting distances according to the sign or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many modelling marks have been passed through the service due to accidents or how long serious certain events have occurred over a period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company that is committed to developing this type of tool.
Among other things, Gt Estimate sells, which is also intended for researchers and also provides digital images, access to shares or prices, and the manufacturer's official times.
Gt Motive is the Ensensa Group established in 1971 as a service provider and the assessment of damage, accidents or maintenance of cars
Gt Guia evaluation is her reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in services, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
The turnover grew by 20% annually over the last three years and in 2008 they accounted for €10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization of the installation of offices in Paris began.
Audadex was born in Germany in 1966 and settled in Spain in 1979.
According to the sources of the company, 62% of her brother is born in Europe and 38% in North and South America. He works with 900 insurance and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 in Spain.
The global billing of the Solar Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informationex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) is $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company produces 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than a million.
In 2005, the Solera group stood at $1,000 million and now its shares are estimated at $2,400 million.
Since 2007 it has been exported to the storm in New York and is included in the Reference Index Standard & Poor's.
Internet transport of dangerous vehicles
Loni bought an Autoonline, an Internet base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after a certain event.
The operation envisaged a commitment of EUR 59.5 million from 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended in the next year by 15%.
The objective of the purchase was to provide more services with added value to customers with access to the international market.
This assessment and purchase and sale service is managed exclusively by professionals in the sector such as insurance, experts, loans, services, sales of remuneration and professional sales who have to register before the start of the operation.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and operates more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, from 500,000 in Germany.
Among the main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The Web currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
It handles 3,000 daily ads and is added to the Spanish market about 100 new ads every day.
According to the Spanish legislation, a car whose number of trailers has been registered cannot be returned to service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles with historical value may have a permit to carry out, even if they have been ordered after pre-treatment.
Service start in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex firm promises that the user will only be able to calculate in four steps: identification of vehicles, looking for work, creation of the budget generation budget.
The ease of use is a fundamental condition for these systems, especially for the certification of professionals at a higher age, who are more or less sustainable in the use of new management techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, of which 666, 109 terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 supplies and 44 trucks.
A computer is required for use with Internet connection.
After identification of the model to be repaired using the number of duplicates, the actual graphic appearance of the model shall be revealed and then the required replacement part shall be selected.
The user may include variable labour prices, fees or discounts and then print and pass to customers.
AudaTaller is not an evaluation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference directory.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is focused on the service and does not include the performance of the labour force.
The costs of using this sharing tool are EUR 350 per year, which the customer can finance.
At the same time, the Audadex company is working to ensure that this view is three-dimensional.
This is innovation that the mechanisms welcome because it is possible, for example, to choose the door and turn it around to look at the inside.
