Can I come too?
Is it true that you have built this house on your own?
Is he not your friend?
Is he not your friend?
I spent a lot of my time learning French.
All of this for you?
Am I in the place of you?
Is that really the reason why you don’t like Tommy?

Is there a place where I can get a visa?
Is there anything you would like to do?
Do you have a suitable place for the field ministry?
