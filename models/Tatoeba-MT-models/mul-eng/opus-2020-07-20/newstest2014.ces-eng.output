A black box in your car?
While American road designers are actively trying to find money to fix a remote network, many start to see solutions in a small black screen that will easily get into your car's driveboard.
The devices that follow every kilometre that the motorists catch and transmit this information to the authorities are the core of Washington's controversial forces and state-planning authorities to renew the old system of financing of American main vehicles.
In general, rural planning has suddenly led to intense debate and the emergence of the most diverse groups.
The Liberals met with the ecological groups and worked to enable the government to use these small rectangles that would be marked by suitable kilometers and perhaps even where you are going – and then use these information to set the tax scale.
Thea party is scared.
The American Union for Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of problems with privacy.
And while Congress can't agree to continue, some states don't expect anything.
They find out how they can move within the next decade to a system in which the driver pays within a mile of the road he goes.
Thousands of motorists already have black boxes, some of which have GPS monitoring, have been tested.
This is a real need for our people.
"No matter when we can make a great choice," said Hassan Ikhrat, Executive Director of the United Nations State Administration in southern California, who plans to start monitoring captive kilometres in each California motor vehicle in 2025.
It'll change the way we pay these taxes.
That's what this technology deserves.
The point is that the Railway Trust Fund is funded from the tax paid by the American State at the railway station.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars catch a lot more than a mile on one gallon.
The federal tax alone, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased over the past 20 years.
Because of the current high price of gasoline, the policies tend to raise taxes by just one cent.
"The tax on gasoline is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert from the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device into 500 cars to test this system of payment within a mile.
"From a long-term perspective, this is the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it a user fee according to the number of kilometres taken.
It is not surprising that this idea likes urban liberals because taxes can be used to change drivers' behaviour patterns, which can, for example, help limit transport cuts and create glass lamps.
The California projectors are responsible for this system when planning strategies to meet the objectives set out in the ambitious global warming legislation.
But Republican Bill Shuster (president of Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Committee on Transport, said that it also sees it as the most effective long-term alternative.
Free market representatives from the Reason Foundation are also convinced that drivers will be paid within a few kilometres.
"It's not the tax that disappears in the black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice-president for the Reason strategy.
People pay for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former US transport ministers, who in 2011 asked Congress to issue a kilometre payment.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project, which was supposed to include about 10,000 cars.
However, the motion was rejected and made because of the concerns of foreign legislators representing the population, whose daily life is often meant to affect many kilometres of work outside the city.
However, a number of states and cities continue to move forward on their own.
The worst is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying the state tax for a mile instead of a gas tax.
The pilot project has never been completed.
New York's just looking into the project.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent in commercial vehicles.
The Coalition I-95, which includes 17 national transport ministers, together with the coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how to implement this change.
This concept, however, has nothing to do with the rest of it.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers were recently equipped with equipment, drivers were concerned that the government is able to monitor each move.
"The concerns related to the monitoring of the Big Brother and similar issues were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who led the management of the strategy and the operation of the Ministry of Transport in Norway.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the pilot project continued, the American Union of Civil Liberties in Nevada warned on its websites: "It would be very easy to change these devices to a fully-assessed monitoring device."
There is no need to build a massive heavy technological infrastructure that is constantly expanding to record the daily outputs and incomes of individuals.
There is no difference between the several states that are trying to find available technology that would allow the state to monitor how many kilometers the train will reach, but not exactly when and where.
If you can, Khan said, the public will be more comfortable.
She introduced some state agencies to small companies in California called True Mileage.
This company was not initially involved in action by the government in taxing drivers.
She wanted to move on to the emerging market, ensuring legal liability, where drivers would pay on the basis of how much they catch.
But this device, which is testing, draws attention to the network designers because it does not use GPS and only provides limited amounts of information that are regularly stored using the modem.
"People will be more willing to go if you don't follow their speed and their position," says Ryan Morrison, executive director True Mileage.
In some of these pilot programmes, a number of serious errors have occurred.
There's a lot easier and less touching ways to do it.
In Oregon, projectors experiment with the choice of drivers.
They can choose devices with GPS or without GPS.
Or it is not necessary to take any equipment and instead decide to pay the passenger fee based on the average number of kilometres occupied by all citizens of the State.
In other places, it is hoped that the general public will accede to this concept, if the device will be more skilled, not less.
In New York City, transport authorities are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped to pay charges in parking hours in order to provide insurance within a few kilometres and to collect data on the speed of other drivers so that motorists can avoid traffic congestion.
"The motorists will be willing to join in this because of the value of the benefits offered to them," says the city's project document.
Some transport planners, however, would like to know whether all the discussions on payment per kilometre are not just a real problem.
Officials of the Metropolitical Transport Committee in San Francisco state that Congress could solve the problem with the Banked Railway Trust Fund, which is very easy to solve by raising the tax on petrol.
A single or annual tax could be imposed on hybrid drivers or other vehicles that do not need a lot of fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
"There is no need for any radical operation when wealth is enough to take up aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their own privacy and a lot of other things.
For ČSSD, Sobotk will be joining us.
Social democracy is broken up, people and Babies are talking together and taking action together.
If social democracy takes place within a few weeks, they will sit at the same table with perfect buried partners who are on the table on the ready list of requirements, including ministerial posts.
ČSSD emissions are then mixed with acidic coalacetic threats, or lead to a gardeny minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka, after four days when he went to his own sympathy, first found him.
Yesterday, he was not allowed to rule a political party and, above all, committed a proven lie to give up.
Only he, the other members of the team, shall be authorised by the approved external coordinator until after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (SEC).
I apologized to the members of the club and now also to the citizens.
He's not lying, he's not in his personal life, not in public.
"It was a mistake," said Michael Hasek after taking the most recent leadership of social democracy.
He added that the president's position is a failure.
"I will send my decision to the CFSP on 10 November," Hašek said.
Similarly, the chairman of ČSSD Zdenýk Škramoch and head of the delegation club Jerony Tejc spoke.
He also warned that he had been selected just two days ago.
Both Members then announced that they were doing everything they could to make the 11th ČSSD club stand by one vote.
"I am a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to her character and have respected the decisions of foreign authorities."
The next lie is in direct transmission.
Or, perhaps when calling on Sobotka's resignation and his resignation from the Conciliation Team, he forgot that the Serbian U.S.U. had committed 57 per cent to the fact that Bohuslav Sobotka was the candidate of the party to the Prime Minister?
The head of the ČSSD made himself a powerful enemy of the army by the call of the CFSP until next week.
Its opponents have ten days to sail the 192 members' e-mails of this body and media with the most diverse drums and fams, and may have recalled the actual errors of Sobot's political career.
There will be a strong flow of spinal cord, the signs of the dark connections between the chlorobared Red Balalow and the Sobot Cross will be revealed.
A friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotky and the influential lawyer of the Council of Pokorné will take place.
They raise disputes in the ČSSD South Morovian or Morovian Organization.
The words of the Austrian prime minister and Sobotak's association Petra Kaynar are alarming: "I signed Chart 77 so that the countries don't control idiots."
If the U.S.A. had already met this week, liars would probably have been brought to the ritual sacrifice of their functions.
The traitors' head will fall and stay.
And the currently winning head of the ČSSD will then end with the preview of Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor on the problems with WHO in Soci: Communication with Russia is mandatory
His mouth's throats mean an unsightly smile, and then it's just a deep breath: "It's delicious."
The collaboration with the organizational team of the Olympics in Soci 2014 is a bit more complex according to Martina Doctor.
We can forget about what happened on the past Olympics.
"Nothing works the same," says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What's going on?
A lot of things work less and less.
It's so confusing.
From the point of view of the invoice they are relatively fast, from the point of view of providing information on basic matters not so far.
We'll need three months to get them to give us the official marking of each village so that we can do the whole number of things.
We're still waiting and they keep saying that they're communicating here.
All right, they're still communicating.
Is there at least an Olympic Village already delivered?
But it's not a disaster situation anymore.
A month ago, we went to empty places.
Happy houses are standing.
What does that mean they're empty?
Do you need to get ready?
It's just basic concrete, so that's what it was like a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even if there's a danger that we'll be there on January 26th as a prelude, it'll still feel nice there.
And if they don't wake up, what's going to happen?
Would President Putin be there for you to leave the army?
That's exactly what's going to happen.
It's just that it's not that the Olympic Village = the Potemkin Village.
It's dangerous, for example, that they don't reach the road, they don't get the details.
Maybe they'll have a way into this state that we're gonna have to take our Holins from London.
But I believe they're giving it to the buyer.
How many Czech athletes could you go to Sochi?
Now they're 78, even though according to nominal criteria, the number changes.
Maybe the raccoons will eat the three they ate.
No one should doubt Martin's family's accelerator, but otherwise it's in development.
Are you still waiting for a trip to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should fly there by January 26th.
As they look like houses in the Olympics, we know.
We even measured some things by ourselves so that we wouldn't believe only in plans.
We're also preparing a whole range of other things, including transport.
And what does the boss do a hundred days before the Olympic Games?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus making a regular agenda for communication with the organizational committee in Soci.
Putin promised the ecological Olympics, his plan was almost coverless.
The fans of winter sports are already building a meter to start Olympic Games in Sochi, others looking for more concerns.
The Russian Olympics, to start up in the basement, still have to deal with another scandal.
According to the Russians, it will not be possible to fulfill the promise that preparations and driving will not affect the very nature of the Krasnodar region in the wake of Kavkazu, where in four months thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will be targeted.
Finally, after the Olympics in Vancouver, the Russians had a very high score, the Canadian Olympic Games were written as the fastest to the environment.
It seems, however, that Russian President Vladimir Putina's commitment to arrange games with "nural waste" has taken place long ago.
Reporters of the AP agency last week revealed a large stock of building material in the village of Achštyr near Sochi.
Thus, the complex of building materials, pneumatics, canysters and insulation plants were already found in August, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities broke down and the warehouse disappeared.
Just for a minute.
Last week the reporters were given a look at the stock of three football fields.
He's not the only one, in the area of such places, a couple of times, wrote the British letter The Times.
On site, Russian railways, state monopol, which is building a 40-kilometre highway between the airport in Soci and the sports resort.
One of the closest Putin's colleagues, Vladimir Jakunin, has already collected 280 billion rubles.
In August, the railways were protected by the installation of one of the subcontractors.
The locals are already desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Achstyru, all three months of the day and night, the cargoes are full of waste material.
Experts say that waste contaminated the local river Mzymt, other streams and finally the Black Sea.
"The water from here is contaminated by the soybean rain forests for the next ten to fifteen years," said the British novel Vladimir Kimajev of the EEA Ecological Non-Discrimination Organisation.
The illegal stocks are not the only problem of the Russian organizational committee and the government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
For comparison: the games in Soci will be $51 billion, while the annual Olympics in Beijing in 2008 went to $43 billion.
London's London games were only 19 billion and the mentioned nine billion outsiders.
In addition to corrupt scandals, project maintenance and concerns, if there is enough snow at the end, reports have also been made that human rights are not achieved at the exhibition of sports and infrastructures.
Last month, one of the workers broke his mouth to protest that he didn't get two months paid.
Many are also afraid of the fact that in the course of the ceremony, Russian organizers are bound by a new law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality.
Some visitors seem to be Russian gays on the Olympics to support.
A couple of young adults live with their parents, a new house offers a private home for both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates has been commissioned to propose a house on the streets, which lies on two streets, where the land itself is sometimes divided.
The demand continued to say that there will be two generations who would want to live together, but then everyone should have their own clearly separated space.
The younger couple also needed a little office.
The house consists of two streets and a peaceful landscape.
The architects therefore decided to move every household into one of the homes.
"In the design of the proposal, we respected the family ties, history and memories of this place."
"The three different functions of the house are connected to several roads through the external object, so everyone knows the presence of others, but then they have their own details," designers explain.
The home of parents is at the level of the garden with the old baroque, to which family traditions and memories are considered.
The simple parts of the house are easily recognized outside, similar to the different final repair phase.
While the main segment of the building is from concrete, whose surface was created using panels from the corner, the part where the office is located is covered with white and remaining remains in clean concrete operation without any further repairs.
Many walls of the house are completely fragile, thanks to which the interior of the house is very occupied with the outside.
The home of the parents, more precise kitchen, food and shelter, includes a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
The interior design with the outside supports the side wall, which starts on the wall and continues until the living room.
Kitchen space in the house of a young couple.
The young couple enter the house at the main entrance to the hall and then walk through the stairs into their rooms.
Just the stairs are the main dominant interior of the house.
Their construction allows them to pass through the cataclysms of natural light.
That's why architects tried to separate the house from other people and to impress him with something unique.
The young couple's home is united as one open room with kitchen, dining room and living room.
From the terrace, it's just a scissors wall with open doors.
Living area with food and kitchen area in the home of a young couple.
The second floor is composed of one large open space, which is free to go to the terrace, where it is a beautiful view of the Tokyo prison.
The office itself in the highest future is made in a clean combination of white and black colors.
The castle is the dominant first interior of the house.
The young couple enter the house at the main entrance, appear in the entrance hall, and then step up the stairs.
Protect academic freedoms, pay for Earth and ODS.
Repeatedly, in recent months, I have called for open letters from students, pedagogues and high schools in a number of countries to defend academic freedoms against a voluntary campaign carried out by President Miloš Zeman at school.
I met with more or less success.
The Director of the University of Masaryk in Brná, who refused to give a lecture by the honourable President of the SPOZ - Landanovci during the pre-trial period, has even received contributions in the form of an invitation not to celebrate the State party of the Czech Republic.
Here are a list of school representatives who have not been so stately and have been able to visit Miloša Eartha: High technical education in Brná, Gymnazium Hladnov in Ostrava, High School Business in Ostrava, Business Academy in Kolin, J.E. University of Purkyný in Ústä nad Labem.
We are now meeting in Pardubice with the continuation of policy enforcement at high schools.
The new elected envoy for ODS, the Dean of the Faculty of Electrotechnicals and Computers of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic function and also seems normal to him.
Mr. Professor, it's really not the same as if you'd stay, for example, in terms of the age of a smaller city.
Do you want to arrange for the ČSSD Haitians who perform the function of the mission and the Haitians at the same time as they degrad both calls?
That's what you're telling people to say that they can handle both of these top left functions.
I know, here we have the example of Michal Haška, who even manages several decades of functions together.
But that's probably not the exact example of the person you should be leading.
We will also find an interesting and bold example of MUDr. French soldiers who prefer to leave the post to complete the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
The main reason of my recommendation to leave the function of the decant is, however, that in the course of this function, you will lose the apolitical academic soil of the University of Pardubice.
Conducting Pardubic ODS sees your current move on both posts as a benefit to the University.
However, you'll be able to help your "your" school without remaining grateful.
I think the same opinion as me and Rector Miroslav Ludwig will have your students.
So take care of your departure and keep your face.
Otherwise, you may be told that your voters are counting on you in the next elections.
And that doesn't have to be long.
In the Kunovian bubbles, chemicals don't add to it
More than a thousand tons of oxygened iron want to be produced in the coming months in the Slovak fruit of Kunovice, which belongs to the Hame Food Group.
The season began in October and ended in six and a half years.
Since 1925, a healthy harvest has been produced in a traditional way, and it's coming directly into large dances.
In modern industrial times it's a rare.
Our workers will find a change of nearly ten kilometer track.
To each of the ten tanks, it takes up to thirty tons of iron to fill one with three changes," said the Slovak Frut David Kladroba train director.
Heads of cattle drive to the area of the company directly from their fields of farmers mainly from Austria and Břeclavska.
The staff of Fruity will clean up the green, remove the bones and dig into the trunk.
From there the already-pounded greens fall into pools with six-foot depths, where they are constantly working in white clothes and hooligans.
That's where the air's going to be so cold.
The last growing species wants to cover the beach and weigh the water.
"The green knob will then appear six to eight weeks after spontaneous milking without any contribution to supporting pollutant," said Director Kladroba.
The process concerned corresponds to the production under domestic conditions, the individual types of workers benefit from salt and quinine.
She's going to the full line after she's done.
He is afraid of a sugarcane in his pockets or glasses and he is told by the sterilization.
Hamé is providing cheese, especially on the Turkish and Slovenian market.
He is also interested in certain other countries, such as Great Britain, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to "cooperate" with Germany in connection with monitoring by the USA
Edward Snowden, a researcher from the American intelligence services, announced that he was willing to go to Berlin to give the German Parliament evidence if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander would not be able to provide answers to questions about their activities.
The German Ambassador Hans-Christian Ströbel met Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was given asylum, and talked to him about the possibility of witnessing in Germany.
In a letter from Mr Snowden, who delivered the press on Friday in Berlin, he said: “Because the results of my efforts have been very positive, the government is still acting as a restraint and trying to criminalize political demonstrations with serious complaints that do not provide room for appeal."
Speaking the truth, however, is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could convince the Government of the United States to be accused of criminal acts against him.
The charges brought by the Ministry of Justice of the United States include spy and stealth of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to the German officials, we will find a way to make it possible."
The tension in the relationship between the United States and Germany began when it became apparent that the NSA was listening to the phone call of Angely Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of Parliament who is taking note of the report panel, said that if there were any opportunity to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness "not to expose himself to danger and to destroy all relations with the United States," it should be done.
Mr Ströbele, Parliament Ambassador for the German side of the Greens, published on his Twitter photo contribution to Mr Snowden.
Two German journalists arrived on their way to Russia.
Mr. Ströbele said that according to the former treaty lawyer, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left once.
If Mr. Snowden were to witness in Germany, he would need assurance that he would be "safe," said a member of Parliament.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden said that he was wearing a tough and durable campaign associated with the persecution that allowed him to leave home.
However, he said that the reaction of the whole world to his “political expression act” gave him the courage.
Citizens and senior officials, including those in the United States, have agreed to identify an uninformed system of universal public monitoring.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities "that the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved."
Killings hate us, but we're innocent, we're proud of the representatives of the Red Khmer.
Nuon Chea was a number two in the Rudy Khmer hierarchy and Khieu Samphan was the former head of state.
For the governments of the Rudý Khmmer, who worked on the Maoism and Nationalism mix between 1975 and 1979, life was affected by hunger, poverty, suffering, torture and correction of more than three million Cambodians, and at least one quarter of the population was present.
This was the result of an infamous S-21 prison sentence by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, torture and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan were proud to believe that they were doing the best interests of the nation and did not know what the real extent of the killing was.
"It's easy to say that I had to know everything, understand everything and then touch and fix the situation," Khieu Samphan announced on Thursday before the court.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I had no right," he added.
Nuon Chea stated that he never ordered the Red Khmer Squares "to treat people badly or kill them to destroy their food or to destroy their genocide."
But he recognized the "mortal responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to apologize to the public, the victim, their families, to all Cambodian people," he said.
Five-year-old Bin Sivla, who came under the Rudí Khummer regime for eleven friendly people, the AFP agency said he can't apologize to Nuon Chea."
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be released from guilt."
"There will be no second," she declared.
"If he didn't give orders, his equipment wouldn't be killed," added that the leaders of the Red Khmer are "more than a monster."
Before the trial, he was also the "Minister of Foreign Affairs" of the Red Khmer regime, Ieng Sary, who died this year in March.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then the Ministry of Social Affairs, was looking for an inconsistencies due to the dementia in September 2012.
The leader of the Red Khmer Paul Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is willing to pay for the handcuffs
Frontier Airlines plans to calculate the amount of up to 100 USD for the storage of handholds on the deck during its years.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to 100 USD for an arm's length and 2 USD for a cup of coffee or soda, even though they said in their notice in the middle that the passengers would be able to leave the entire package.
The new fee for the manual undertaking relates to the undertaking in the upper office space, so the small undertaking under the seat will continue to be free.
Frontier says it will account for $25 if the payment is paid in advance, and $100 if they are traveling with payment waiting until they arrive at the gate.
A spokesman from Frontier Kate O'Malley stated that the hundreds of dollars payment has to wake up to make the payment forward.
"We'd rather choose this fee," she said.
The airlines started to pay the first and second charges in 2008.
Travellers tried to avoid these fees and went to the manuals hidden in the office area as much as they could, so there was often a lack of space in this area.
Payments are one of the ways to learn to read less on the deck.
O'Malley said the idea of this new payment is really not to get more money.
This is because the most reliable customers of Frontier's company have made it quite clear that finding a place in the top office space is still more difficult.
Travellers who buy flights on the websites of companies will not pay.
This means that one passenger in front of Frontier can bring an undertaking that does not pay anything, while the other traveler in front of the same undertaking will pay 100 USD.
O'Malley said that the website and the equipment procedures would be adjusted to ensure that the traveler knows about the fee before coming to the border.
The new fee of Frontier for the arm's length will not yet be available before the summer, but the date has not yet been set.
Travellers often get paid for holidays and other payments, but airlines love them.
He claims that the manipulatives are money, and the passengers who ask for this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider another fee for the undertaking as a sign that airlines are trying to choose a sufficient amount of money to cover the costs of air traffic after years of loss.
But most of them didn't get paid for handcuffs.
Spirit Airlines was the first to pay off the handholds three years ago and another low-cost Allegiant Air followed her example later.
The only company that also has such payments is Hungarian Wizz Air, says air transport consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors additional charges.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that the fee for the Spirit company's manual liabilities would be $50 million a year.
Sorensen, former director of Midwest Airlines, recently flew to Spirit Company and was surprised by what he saw in the yard when the passengers met with the extraordinary fee of Spiriti's manual undertaking.
"The approach to the plane was the most urgent thing I've ever seen in my flight career," he said.
I've been waiting for you to see the teeth and lips in the wall.
The plane was full, he said, "and the train went into the kitchen."
Frontier also, after the example of Spiriti company, apply payments for coffee, tea, soda and juice.
Frontier said that travellers who get lemonade or juice can leave their entire coat and coffee will be filled free.
Water will continue to be provided free.
In 2008, US Airways recently tried to pay for drinking, but after seven months of travel difficulties, no other significant airlines found it.
The last of these companies, Frontier, to pay the manual if the traveler does not buy a flight directly from this airlines, is its last effort to direct customers directly to its website.
The airlines pay online travel sellers, such as Orbitz, from 10 to 25 USD for each sold flight.
This has enabled all airlines to move passengers to purchase directly from them instead of doing so through Internet travel agencies.
Frontier's company, however, has come to this area as far as possible.
In September it began to give customers who bought via the Internet travel agency only half a mile under the credit programme.
In the mid-term, the rate of compensation was 25 per cent from the route concerned.
So the road to Frontier is 1,000 miles long purchased via the Internet travel agency means a 250 miles reward.
Customers are also allowed to choose from their seats only if they purchase directly through Frontier’s website.
Frontier's company has a loyal client base in its home town of Enver, but its business starts to collapse and lose money.
According to the financial results reported by the company partner Republic Airways Holdings, the market decreased by 9 per cent and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter.
The Republic company is trying to solve the legal and financial problems of Frontier.
The NSA site is not accused of hacking, but "inland error"
The Secret National Security Agency indicated last Friday that its websites for several hours last week fell because of internal error, never because of the attack of hackers, as some have claimed on the Internet.
"The NSA.gov attacks were not available several hours tonight due to internal error which occurred during regular updates," the Spanish agency stated in an e-mail release.
The problem will be solved during tonight.
The claim that the incident was caused by a DDOS attack (distributed refusal of service) is incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online photographers reported that NSA websites didn't work at least six hours, and sites are still unavailable for some users.
Previously speaking NSA ABC News reported that the internal sensitive network of agencies had not been "never" threatened.
The speaker said no confidential information was threatened.
At least one group of hackers on the Internet claimed that it was responsible for listing the NSA site through the DDoS attack.
DDoS flights are designed to navigate the target websites with information until the servers do not go over and the site does not fall.
This cybernetic tactic is relatively simple and the meaning of attacks does not go into the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA supertina agency, which once received a review of no such agency, has been following the announcement of foreign and domestic monitoring programmes through public attention and the target of critical criticisms, together with a product of secret NSA files from the agency and their expression by former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency led to an earlier speculation that today's accident was the result of a targeted cybernetic operation.
The profits of Bombardier’s company were lost due to the decrease in supply and order
The Canadian aircraft manufacturer and train Bombardier reported on Thursday a 50-percent decrease in net profit resulting from the lower number of orders and delivery of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier also did not disclose any data on the flight test for its new CSeries aircraft, nor did he offer any information on whether this aircraft will have an ambitious plan to start commercial operation from next session.
After an exciting pilot flight about a month and a half, the aircraft only flew three times and asked whether the test phase was going well.
The results were incomplete and the stock on the storm in Toronto dropped by 8 per cent.
The state bank analysis Cameron Doerkssen reduced the "high-quality" rating to the "external sector" on Thursday, with the expectation that the bursa will be enjoying limited growth during the next quarter or two.
"As the less supplies of the aircraft were expected most, the profits in the transport sector were significantly diminished," Doerschen reported to customers.
As the pilot programme continues, we believe that Bombardier's company will get new orders for CSeries aircraft.
However, if there are no new orders in the coming months, we assume that market surpluses will increase against this programme.
Bombardier company hopes that the CSeries aircraft will be deployed to the lower market area, which now dominates Boeing and Airbus.
The first pilot aircraft was discovered in March and, after several months of delay, the first year of flight was completed in September.
However, the number of mandatory orders for CSeries aircraft reaches 177 low, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the pilot flight to verify the company's claims regarding low consumption and support for the costs of this transport aircraft.
Currently there are 403 orders and obligations from 15 customers and operators.
Executive Director Pierre Beaudoin expected that the company Bombardier will achieve its target of 300 mandatory orders when introducing the first aircraft to commercial use.
The executives also assured on Thursday that the programme is being carried out according to the plan.
"The pilot aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," said Beaudoin in a conference talk and noted that the country's tests and software updates were planned during the departure of the aircraft.
Every manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to graduate for the first year and then focus on updating and we did.
This will happen during the entire flight programme.
According to Bombardier, the second of five pilots should be deployed in the coming weeks and the remaining weeks after.
The analysts are still skeptical about the fact that the first customer could start operating CSeries 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier claims that it has assessed its flight introduction plan and will provide updated information in the following months.
“This slow pace of flight tests – although it is in line with Bombardier’s internal plan – will obviously strengthen our view that the introduction to operation will take place on the first quarter of 2015,” Doerssen said.
Of the 172 million dollars or 9 cents per share in the previous year, at the end of the third quarter of September 30, the net profits of Bombardier's company fell to 147 million dollars, or 8 cents per share.
The adjusted results for one share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
The turnover is marginally reduced from 4.2 billion dollars to 4.1 billion dollars.
According to the IBES system of Thomson Reuters, analysts expected 10 cents per share and turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest manufacturer of the aircraft indicated that the turnover of 57 aircraft a year earlier added only 45 aircraft during that quarter.
Pure orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The non-compliance with the air-conditioning bans amounted to 32.9 billion September 30, which does not change until 31 December.
"The results in the airport were in accordance with our views, but the low acceptance of the order and the overall market position have weakened us," said Beaudoin.
Air industry output amounted to 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, indicated that the profit in this division increased by almost 11 per cent to 2.1 billion dollars.
Unfulfilled orders were made at 30 September 32.6 billion, which is around 31 December of marginal growth.
In the transport sector, there were problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
The managers indicated that new views would be provided in the fourth quarter.
The shares of Bombardier, which also announced the arrival of the financial director of Google Patrick Pichettea, decreased by 8.5 per cent on Thursday at the value of USD 4.83.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the third largest producer of commercial aircraft and the closest competitor of Bombardier’s company, announced a 10-percent fall in the quarter.
A lawyer dependent on cocaine that protected the mafia from police investigation is in prison
Basharat Ditta (42) was supposed to provide information to the king of the Underworld of Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was afraid his drug addiction would come to an abrupt end.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A spy lawyer who informed the drug mafia of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his drug addiction would come to light, he was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) was then suspected of using cocaine, chief of Neil Scarbrough's subworld to provide sensitive information on investigating his drug-related activities.
The lawyer whose review was “Bash” (part) and who was celebrated as the best legal representative was arrested after the police surveillance of Scarborough, who was arrested in previous drug proceedings in 2011.
The police looked at Sarborough (32) as he left in a lawyer's house in Blackburn in Lancashire, which was just at dinner with his colleagues from the Legal Society, three cocaine bags.
On the basis of a test in which cocaine levels were found in his hair, his money and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular drug user of Class A.
During the eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he tried to obtain information on the arrest of two men in the favor of Scarborough and his colleague.
All four suspects were then monitored in the context of a large investigation of trafficking in heroin and cocaine in the Lancashire, Cumbra, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire areas.
After a series of police charges held heroin and cocaine at a value of about 1.5 million GBP plus 200 000 GBP in cash, 32 more people were arrested together.
Ditta (42) provided information to criminals for fear that he would come to rely on cocaine.
Today, Ditta, who works in Forbes Solicitors legal society with his seat in Blackburn, lived before the Liverpool Crown Court for a long time when he was followed by a three-day trial because in two cases he defended justice.
During the previous hearing, he agreed to hold the cocaine.
The lawyer's appeal came after a police investigation in Scarborough found that he was in regular contact with Dinito in February 2011.
Two suspects followed, recorded his arrival at Ditto's house, and watched him put a 60 - percent clean drug under law in a black golf course.
The following was Scarborough with Ditto, who was at the football stadium in Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park, in a regular telephone conversation.
The lawyer returned home where he found drugs, and nine conversations took place between the two persons.
The court found that class A drugs were found in his hair, money and credit cards and that Ditta was a "regular user" cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but he was afraid of cocaine use, and said that he spoke to a suspect dealer because he was his client and argued that their conversation was “trust communication”.
During his arrest, Ditta took his money and tried to get out of it several credit cards, but all were arrested and his hair samples were taken.
At the police interview, he said that he was running the office both at his home and at his workplace and that his clients visited him because of his job.
However, the court has heard that after key arrests, he contacted important players in a drug dealer network, some of whom had previously intervened in order to share with them what he knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “Who knows better than the legal representatives in the criminal field, who knows better than anyone else that they must not violate the law."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a legal representative and of getting too close to the client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who uses his own lawyer's drugs.
Some of his conversations must have been legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the ordinary relationship of a lawyer-client.
The police investigation measured as much as possible to enable them to continue in their criminal activities.
Mr. Dieta didn't bring his professors good news, but he destroyed her.
He drew too close to certain customers, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be violated.
Ditta refused the move and declared: “If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not, and I would like to give Mr. Scarborough information, I wouldn’t wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.”
After hearing, however, police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: "Mr. Ditta became a criminal himself at the time he began to obtain drugs from organised criminals."
His dependence on cocaine made him hopelessly weak and vulnerable to the plans of the previous representatives of the organised crime group, which led him to collect valuable information on the police investigation.
Legal representatives must adhere to the highest principles of confidentiality and should build confidence and feel that they can rely on them.
Mr. Dieta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind his profession.
The unit for serious and organised criminal acts in Lancashire led against Mr. Ditto's investigation, on which he was also sentenced for three cases of cocaine detention and now for the defence of justice, which demonstrates our obligation to bring a crime before the court.
This case should serve for all criminals as a warning that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and stand before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he was declared guilty of conspiracy for the purpose of delivering heroin, cocaine and cocaine.
The other thirty-five persons involved in trafficking were imprisoned for 153 years for drug trafficking.
On his website Ditta arranged an online conversation about himself, in which he said that his explicit work would be legitimately represented by clients from the block of death in America, as a guest at dinner would invite Mohamed Aliho and as a motivation for the work.
He was talking about the government with Klaus and Spidlo.
Now the people of Jan Kasala have sent out against Babish.
The people received only one-third of the number of social Democrats or UN representatives in the elections.
They come in at least with one advantage.
In a team that has already begun to capture pictures of possible coalitions, Jan Kasala - men, who have created conditions for government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Social Democrats or Andrej Babish have no such matador on their side.
This is likely to be a reminder of the first meeting in 1992, when ODS was also a completely new party.
"The experiences were minimal at that time," Kasal suggests how annual talks will be developed.
Controversy of the Media Act
"It is a terrible message and it is in place to ask what Parliament will prevent in order to simply ignore the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," the news quoted the draft anti-corruption law.
"This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, the Director-General of the Capital Group, which also belongs to CapitalFM, one of the most well-known independent advertising stations and reporting websites.
He said that the new media court "will always be predictable because it is extended by the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we will ask him to reject this proposal and return it to the Members," he said.
According to Star, the government's proposal actually provides "full control over the media" and the Standard newspaper states that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya "has taken a heavy toll", and criticises the proposal as "close".
The adoption of the legislative proposal comes at the centre of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the attacks of an Islamic shooter in the shopping center of Westgate.
The anger of the authorities was directed by the Kenyan media when it sent out a record of security cameras on which soldiers sent to the site of the attack were deliberately engaged in trade with the luxury goods.
The police chief responded by allowing two journalists and a leading media officer to the hearing, but the hearing was delayed after media pressure.
According to the new proposal, media companies may be subjected to up to 20 million Kenyan complaints and individual journalists to one million with the risk of “listing” or official accreditation.
The Court shall also have the right to enjoy the property of the defendants if the court is not charged.
According to the Daily Nation, “a single attempt is enough to break most of the voting stations. ”
It is also stated that these measures may have a liquidity impact on what is called the Kenyan "living blogosphere".
Politicians know that when the media shut down, they can do whatever they want without worrying about it.
"You never know what can happen," wrote the National Mutuma Mathhiu newspaper and described the Kenyan media as a key source of the system of mutual control and export in public life.
"When we leave it in politics, the country will bring us back to bankruptcy and raise us back to the money and the congregation," he wrote.
The lawmakers in Kenya have been in the past in the face of public criticism.
In May, they voted for the abolition of the sanctions imposed by the national environmental agency and for the renewal of their current payments of approximately 532,000 outstanding monthly shillings, which are so ordered to be the highest in the world.
He has to calm down, he knows young Czechs.
Most of them, but they don't even know what levels they are
More and more Czechs are giving money away.
However, they do not reach campaigns to dispute in the region.
The most money abroad is collected by the Rakuyans, who spend monthly in the average of 181 euros.
There's more to it than Czech people in Slovenia.
This is due to a study of the group of Erste Savings Barometers in Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the demand of drivers improves and two thirds of the respondents plan to spend more money abroad.
While Cheši is a hole in the middle of the miners' grid, people in Romania and Serbia still use mixed products very little.
For example, almost every other Serb, according to the survey, will be housed under the police station.
In Turkey this year, the number of those who earn a higher monthly salary.
Still, each month for the most diverse type of dispute, thousands to 2.5 thousand, as many as 26 per cent of respondents, this year it is about five per cent more.
The average monthly position in the mid-year comparison, but moderately adjusted to 2078 kroner.
The biggest hit between the retail products is pension insurance.
This represents 54 per cent of Czechs, while only 36 per cent of the people were treated as the most popular way of measuring support three years ago.
On the other hand, the design of the construction dispute has also been clearly lost in the past year.
You're using only 16 percent of the respondents, while the Loni was about a quarter of the people.
The study also showed that although people consider it important to feed, most of them do not know the results of individual products.
First of all, young people in their 30 ’ s do not know how their money is spent.
On the other hand, the best information about the value of your saved money has the oldest group of respondents, and among people over 50 years, 73 percent of the respondents know it.
In an international comparison, the group of Erste Česi leads to the use of online banking, which uses 44 per cent of people regularly.
The following are Slovaks and Rakushana with a 12 percent discount.
The UN celebrates new goals of combating poverty
The United Nations organization begins to work independently on a new target file that replaces the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were introduced 12 years ago for the purpose of addressing global poverty.
Before the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which started in Rio de Janeiro last night, Australian diplomats played a key role in the implementation of "Sustainable Development Goals", which are to be rewarded by MDG, whose validity is widened in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
OSN Secretary-General Mr Ki-mun said during the night at the summit that now is the time to “be proud of national interests”.
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and adopt a process to achieve the overall objectives of sustainable development – SDG," he said.
The SDG will build on the progress achieved in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the development programme after 2015.
I am putting forth every effort to fulfil my mandate given to me by the Member States and to realize our vision of sustainable development goals, which will lead to the success of MDGs.
Mozambique's security concerns are raised because of the conflict of strong personalities
Under the shadow of Samory Machely, the president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputa to bring peace to the ordinary public demonstrations.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing the future of his country, he changed his business clothes for a three-legged letter “We require security” in Portuguese and joined in on Thursday to the State of Independence in the main city.
Two weeks later, almost daily reports of conflicts between the government forces and the party of Renamo, one of the worst flows from the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel gang, originally supported by the white government in Rhodesia and then by the government apartheid in South Africa, in the framework of the dreams of destabilization of the independent government of this country.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts are convinced that it is unlikely that an open conflict will again arise in the country, but recent developments have suggested foreign investors and locals.
The economy is rapidly growing, because the emergence of vast coastal reserves of oil and oil on the north-west can take over the next few years from companies such as Brazil's Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy, Eni and American Anadarko, investments worth more than $50 billion.
The ruling party Frelimo, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo, are accused of being motivated by jealousy.
The party of Renamo claims that the government has caused the last conflict by launching an attack on its members on 17 September in the province of Sofala, the traditional village of the Party of Renamo.
The violent attacks of former rebels followed when the government forces attacked on the basis of Renamo's side and tried to kill Afon Dhlakam, the leader of the group, said to the Financial Times spokesman of Renamo Fernando Mazanga.
The government is charged with the defeat of the Renamo conflict because it attacked the soldiers first.
President Armando Guebuza has been trying to calm down the instability.
Mr. Guebuza, French Press Office AFP said in the middle that Mr. Dhlakas saw himself as a "sustainment" who wanted to use "any remaining power to prove that the government could make its own decisions".
Like Frelimo, Renamo says they want to avoid war.
But the fears grew when Mr. Mazangy's words were quoted that the party of Renamo was withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
A letter from the FT said he thought that the party to Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to the meeting, but seriously," said Mr. Mazanga.
Previous discussions between these parties have been conducted to reduce the tension between these parties, which has been reduced by a series of flows this year, only a few.
It's a spell between two large personalities (Guebuz and Dhlakas), said a lecturer at Open University and expert at Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
Not one of them is a good translator and not one of them is prepared to take the necessary steps.
The Renamo side, which came to light on the change in the election, has already declared that it would fight the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for the next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as a powerful force to attract interest from government benefits and financial investments.
The voluntary share of Renamo has decreased since 1992, while the newest party, the Democratic Party of Mozambique (DHM), which was based on the former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza, whose second working period will end next year, wants to destroy the democracy of this country.
"He doesn't want a democratic system anymore, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace, because he doesn't want to leave the presidential office," Mazanga said.
It's unclear what the Renamo side has, but he's been carrying out vicious terrorist attacks on the police station and on vehicles on the key road between the north and the south.
For the most part, the flood occurred in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred miles away from the main city of Maputo, but where is the city of Beira, the port on which the companies depend, including Rio Tinto and Vale, are on the export of coal.
In June Rio stopped using the railway for about a week when Renamo side threatened to attack this line.
Mr. Mazanga didn't want to explain to you whether Renamo is in danger.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good," Mazanga said.
The instability has increased the frustration of governments, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media companies Mediacoop, and many people also have concerns about corruption, slow development and recent flooding of orphans.
"People think that responsibility for the future of the country is extremely important to the government and the president and that he should be the one who will find solutions to the problems," he says.
Democrat Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
"No one cares about either Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the road," she says.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for the way of life”, says the author.
The experiences of Thor can show that “the grave power cannot be equal to the smartness of lstivasti, ” while the Artusian legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
Much of the myth would "be too wild for school education, too scandalous and, in some cases, too obscenity," said Crossley-Holland, who agrees to make a conscientious choice for the age.
"I think it's great that myths and human creation are already part of education," he said.
I've been thinking about this plan for 20 years.
He added that "open teachers" authors and teachers are in plain stories with a "substantial" message for children as a "smoker".
Crossley-Holland, who translated the Beowulf epos and who also writes Norwegian coins (Penguin Book) and British national daughters, says: "You can have good ideas, but you can do better if you leave them for yourself."
Perhaps the greatest difference between the adult author's writing for adults and the adult author's writing for children is the need for a sense of hope.
It may not be that everything has to be simplified or to end with a Happy, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil there.
And he must be informed, and he shall not be made to know by any means by any means, by the means of which he is made manifest.
The old truth is it's better to show it than to describe.
The Bronze Star will take visitors to the universe in the new digital world
At first glance, it is evident that the size of the planetary world changed in the last half of the year.
There's a new village here, visitors can go into new comfortable seats, and the project site comes up on their heads about 17 meters in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
In order to make the picture perfect, there are even smaller projectors on the floor.
Another important part of the entire device is hidden behind the wall.
"It's about twenty-one computers that generate a picture," said the Bronze Star director Jiří Dušek.
The computer will ensure that the image from several projectors is not covered, but gives a complete picture.
"The power of computers is thirty-four times higher than in classic personal computers," said a technique from Starman Tomáš Hladík.
The digital system can test both realistic and plastic models of nighttime clouds, human body or ocean bottom.
They're so curious right in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
Another similar device is closest to Warsaw or Hamburg.
The steering of the star plans in the salts to promote the order and design of its own.
Since Saturday, there's two orders on the program.
His first name is Astronaut and is intended for adults.
People learn about cosmonaut training, travel to the universe, compete on the centrifuge, and then see how amazing the conditions of the astronauts in the outer space are.
The second order is for children and has the name Kouzelný tues - Kaluoka'hin.
It tells the story of the storm that the pestrobaric inhabitants lived in a quiet life until the time when the nearby soybeans were released.
The entire range of the digital industry stood at a total of tens of millions of dollars, which paid to the school's prime minister.
The smaller parts also contributed to the city of Brno and the star from its budget.
The project area was ten million kroner, the projector twelve million.
"The rest of the team of audiovisual technology and computers," Dušek explained.
The digital installation followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the star had passed two years ago.
According to Director Duška, by the end of the year, 25 to 30,000 visitors could be reached.
We studied 11 thousand inzerat!
We know where they want you to go!
In November last year, the analysis included over 11 thousand interns offering jobs, 4300 of which were published in daily printing and 6800 internships (62 per cent) on the Internet.
The Internet thus becomes the most important media to publish employment offer.
In 2005, when the first study was conducted, 26 per cent of the study was conducted.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010), 60 per cent was found.
Inserts of labour opportunities in themselves, according to the analysis, significantly reflect the current situation on the labour market.
For example, a simple comparison can be made between the number of registered investors in the period of economic prosperity and in the period of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007 almost 25,900 inserates were published during the same period, which was less than half in 2012.
The offer of working positions on the Internet is focused on higher education, especially for a more qualified professional group.
On the contrary, the offer of employment in daily printing covers a wide range of professions, including those of the workshops, presented by author Pavlín Čăstnová.
The aim of representing selected professional groups is different in both media.
On the Internet, there have been pre-eminent places for managers and managers, business representatives, programmers and financial experts.
The position of programmers or leading small businesses was only on the Internet.
In daily printing, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, but the large representation is especially of professional and professional professions.
Of course, among the most frequently mentioned requirements that employees express by means of inert tenders are education.
The knowledge of foreign languages, especially English, was shared in the next follow-up area.
In daily printing, the requirement to know a foreign language was stated in three percent of the population, on the Internet by 37 percent.
Only two percent of the employees requested active knowledge of two foreign languages.
The results of the 'digital graffiti' were shown in 40 percent of the ads (in daily prints 11 percent, on the Internet 57 percent).
The practice in the field was required in 54 per cent of the inserates.
The requirements for practice are universally linked to qualified professions.
In particular, it's about leading production and other leading workers.
The industrial professions include, in particular, mechanics and manufacturers and food processors or the repair of electrical equipment, the author of the study Jiří Tillner.
Employees also place requirements on the property and the ability of the candidates concerned in half of their own interns.
As the most often required skill in the first place, communication skills are already being developed in the first place for a long time.
Other employees require flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, independence, responsibility, organizational capacity and reliability.
Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York comedy festival: New Yorker
It might be said that New York City is a place where solo comics were born in America: nearly a century ago, various artists, Frank Fray, who worked as chairman of the series at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to give the assembled people the impression of the method of conversation.
Fay's innovation has grown over the years, the latest through the New York comedy festival.
The festival, founded and controlled by Caroline Hirschov, founder of the solo comedy Carolinas, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year – along with more than sixty performances in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these titles appeared in the Carolinas and became successful in the sense that they are too big to play in the club," said Hirschov.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
The annual event includes the exhibition of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mahera, as well as “Stand Up for Heroes”, the annual musical comedy benefit exhibitions in Madison Square Garden, which includes the exhibitions of Bruce Springstein, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
As this festival expanded, so did the comedy world.
Several comics from the annual festival came from non-traditional channels, such as shows in smaller advertising or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll grew up with his seat (the proud "League" on a fantastic-photoball theme on the FXX) and now has his own comedy central show.
Jenny Slate was a member of the "Saturday night live" program, such as "Parks and recreation", but most of the time she was celebrating the wide series of videos "Marcel the shell with shoes on".
Like Kroll, both Slate, like other young commissions with clearly recognized voices (surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, traveling, racially targeted W. Kamau Bell), are the product of a decentralised world of American comedy.
One of the biggest events of the festival will be the conversation: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a solo comedy, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an informal comedy history.
From 2005 to 2007, he organized a TV show called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting is held in Town Hall in the center of Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedy DNA all Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes goes through the street between two buildings and says, "Man, if I get all the money, I might live here."
The price of roses went on at $96 for barl
On Friday's basis, the price of roses continued to reflect the high stock concerns of the report, which demonstrated the strengthening of the Chinese steel industry.
The U.S. Red Indicator for Prosin Supply During the afternoon morning, the European electronic commerce for a New York business storm of 14 cents at $96.24 per barrel.
On Thursday, the drop was 39 cents, and the monthly drop was 5.8 per cent.
The rich stocks of roses in the past few weeks have been worth the price.
The Ministry of Energy in the Middle East reported that the US resources increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, stocks increased by over 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, from two reports on Chinese production, he came up with a larger questionnaire showing growth in practice.
This means that China's economic prosperity, which has increased by 7.8 per cent after growth in the past two weak decades, can continue to grow.
Ropa Brent, an indicator for international robot also used by American refineries, fell at the International Trade Exchange in London at 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel.
That's not it, Mr. Haske.
We have the only chance to show politicians that they don't.
It is necessary to make such pressure so that Martin Hasek is free of all political functions and has left the ambassador's mandate.
Any other solution reduces the level of political culture that is already so mixed.
Martin Hasek is protected by the promise he made, but everyone and politics must in particular be aware of the consequences of that promise and seriously consider what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that politics has (Mr. Babish has this weight, but it is the question of whether politics is true).
The more malicious the program, which is spread by lies, is untrustworthy.
We don't talk about politics, we don't talk about politics.
Mr. Hašku, if you think it's good with this country (and your frequent statements make me think about it, if you're not right - here you can see how it's faked), you'll leave politics alone as a man.
Then people will accept your apology as an expression of a man who made a mistake and takes responsibility for it.
In the wrong case, you will be treated as helpless minors whose words and actions you cannot believe.
You either want to be proud to be a missing person or a lifeboat.
You may think it's unfair when I speak only of you, but you're the leader and they're just wrong sheep.
And you're the leader and you always wanted to be.
I understand that you're trying to wrap your ears up for a moment, recapture your strength, sit down here and then fight again, but that's how the parties or supporters behave.
You're, I repeat, in your eyes, the only alpha, so behave like that.
Take responsibility and get out of politics.
The Court has blocked regulations concerning the procedure for the arrest and investigation of persons by the NYPD
On Thursday, the Federal Court of Appeal blocked the judicial regulation requiring changes in the arrest and search of persons at the police station in New York and, as the case may be, dismissed the court.
A second U.S. Federal Court of Appeal said that the decision of Judge Shiry Schindlin would be postponed until the decision on the city's appeal.
In August, the court decided that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing its programme of stopping and questioning people.
The City of Conclusions and its Rules of Procedure agreed, including the decision to assign a review that would help the police department to change its procedures and the school program associated with them.
The Court of Appeal has heard the arguments on Tuesday for the requested suspension.
The appellant said that the court had to be dismissed from the case because it had come into conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, and that as the judge did not agree on the requirement to avoid the existence of an undertaking, partly because of a series of discussions with the media and a public statement that was open to the court’s criticism.
The court decided that the police officers had violated the civil rights of dozens of people when they were wrongly focusing on the blacks and Hispani within their programme of stopping and looking for people.
It established an independent assessment to take into account major changes, including reforms in procedures, training and monitoring, and to arrange for the launch of a pilot programme for testing cameras carried on the body in certain areas where the most frequent stopping of persons is possible.
In August, New York City announced the termination of the method of retaining the names and addresses of people whose cases were dismissed after police inspection.
The oral reason for the city’s withdrawal is sometimes planned after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of arrest and search of persons have criticised a number of civil rights defenders.
In a certain form, there is a stop and look of persons for almost a number of decades, but marked visits under the management of independent age Michael Bloomberg dramatically grew to record number 684 330 in 2011, in most cases black and Spanish.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belonged to the minority, filed a complaint that resulted in a group complaint.
The remaining amendments to the suspension and inspection programme by the police department in NY claim that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the reliability and effectiveness of the police force and may affect the use of these procedures by other police departments.
Opposers claim that changes reduce police morality, but not crime, and that they spend money on it, but do not solve more problems when the police are under pressure after the last decade, which has reduced its number of thousands of people.
The court noted that she did not complete the practice of stopping and investigating persons who are constitutional but reformed the way the police department's surveys in the NY.
Five shopping centers are affected by low visits
This is the result of the data from the real consultancy companies Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
In the Prague Bohnicas, the public is open to the Krakov Trade Centre, the 19th Prague Shopping Centre.
There are now 90 major trading centers in the PRC.
The unsatisfying performance concerns approximately 20 per cent of large and large centres.
The main problems are inadequately large centre against local and bad layout, so too much patter or complicated and transparent fit order, possibly dead centre," Michael Soták from Cushman & Wakefield said.
According to the leading division of retail properties of Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, about five commercial centres are affected by low-visibility.
Among the main reasons are poor transport availability, low receiving categories of local residents or market oversustainability at the given place.
Some projects have opened almost fully, but their results have been largely unsatisfactory at first.
At present, customers are sometimes conservative and do not change their buying habits.
The new business centre must try to improve its customers' "reading" on new brands, entertainment, services and marketing," Samadi added.
The volume of shopping centers is generally stable, even in some centres, because the buyers were willing to drop out of the rent and acquire some units in the crisis.
"But it is true that in recent times some projects that are not fully equipped and medium-sized have been so reduced (e.g. Breda & Winestein in Opavia, Šantovka in Olomouci) have been opened," Soták added.
The business centre opened in the last two years is on the market according to Sylvie Samadi very slowly.
A place on the market for new projects, but there is.
The number of places suitable for the construction of the successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see a project building space that would serve the people of Prague 6.
On the market, there is certainly a space for the construction of smaller local projects, such as 'convinience centres', focused on purchases and services for the daily needs of citizens living in the immediate environment," said Samadi.
According to the Sotaka, there is also a place on the domestic market for other shopping centres.
And it's like for a small 'service' centre, for large projects in Prague, or for medium-sized projects, or for expansion in regional cities.
"City like Kladno, Czech Buddejovice, Brno or Plzeň have room for further growth," Soták added.
In Prague, there is a room for a commercial centre prepared at the Vicenė, and according to it, there is a clear potential of the street in Příkopé and Václavska.
"Intensively, the expansion of the spare parts of parks, which enable merchants to cover and expand to even smaller cities for affordable rental and operating costs, is also in some localities for smaller local or residential shopping centres, in relation to their reconstruction, such as the reconstruction of priority shops which are difficult from good location," DTZ added Dita Kubánkova.
There are currently 90 modern shopping centres in Czech with a total of more than 2.2 million metres of square root areas.
The fourth of all these shopping centers is located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine are in Prague, resulting from Incoma GfK's data.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is across the EU, compared with the values from Britain and France, about 50 square meters per 1,000 inhabitants remain in Czech Republic.
Coulson turned to the phone to check the guy.
Former editor News of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson has apparently used methods of "telephoneing, monitoring and confrontation" to confirm the subversive type of loving relationship to which the former Minister of the Interior Charles Clarke should be involved.
State representative Andrew Edis told the Old Bailey court that the news of the World had caught false news in May 2005 that Clarke was seen with his "attractive special advice" to Hannah Pavlby.
Newspapers convinced private investigator Glenna Mulcaire to turn to Paulby's voice recorder and enter her private, but it was found in court that Coulson called her and left her voice messages.
"The State Representative indicates that Mr. Coulson, who is now a NotW editor, is not a person standing in front of the house and hopes that people will be caught outside, but a person who likes stories to see what they say," Mr. Edis said.
He said that the News of NotW used three ways to explore stories: turning to telephone, monitoring and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Of course he knows about the second, monitoring, he needs to know about it.
What about the first one?
Do you know about getting in the phone?
He says no, we say, "But he certainly knows."
Fame on the loving relationship that Clarke was involved was first caught by the news reporters NotW, when a source that had sexual interest in Mrs. Paulby was said, "You're wasting time, it's Charles."
The record of the voting messages received from her phone at a minimum of three opportunities was obtained at the home of Mulcairo in August 2006.
The investigators also found records in the computer of a private investigator where Mrs. Paulby and her sister were designated as "Projects".
During the period when Mrs. Paulby was examined, her relatives received anonymous phone calls asking for information about Paulby, said Mr. Edis.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup watched Mrs. Pavlby's movement.
Coulson left her a voice message on June 18, 2005, in which he told her: “I have come up with a story that we want to discuss tomorrow and which I would like to talk to Charles very much. ”
Mr Edis says that Coulson's involvement in the story was based on the same model as in other significant personalities, including former Minister inside David Blunkett.
The court ruled on Thursday that Coulson was confronting Mr. Blunketta because of his loving relationship with his wife while he himself met with the defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks extended their association with other persons for telephone calls from 3 October 2000 to 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup agreed to call.
NSA detection increases the corporate monitoring pattern by the State
One evening at the end of August, the German police station was on the American consular office in Frankfurt, the main city of the German economy.
At the direction of the Polish Institute for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German domestic reporting agency, the mission was to organize photographs of U.S. fires, which are located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media claim that BfV hoped that it would be able to identify the presence of listening antennas and that this action had put an exchange of views between the US and German foreign ministers in Berlin.
James Clapper, the U.S. National Public Prosecutor, once again stressed that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence, "to steal the business secrets of foreign companies in favour of American companies and to enhance their international competitiveness or to increase their profits".
But since Edward Snowden, who became an informant from his colleagues, has begun to withdraw his valuable collection from the United States of Secret Monitoring, European governments and former entrepreneurs no longer know if they have to trust the words of the director.
According to reports that the United States National Security Agency carried out a spy in the Brazilian mining company and obtained access to data from American cloudy suppliers, including Google and Yahoo, achieved a general paranoia on monitoring new dimensions.
The last trap came up with the announcement that Angely Merkel's phone was probably ten years off.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be the target, they are certainly the potential target of the former entrepreneurs.
Snowden has seen intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that this data is used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a study published in July by the EC Advisory Service, German companies are convinced that, in terms of industrial spying and theft of data, the United States is now at the same risk as China.
However, there is no evidence in the whole of Mr Snowden's document, however, that the United States has passed on the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain skills in IT and the Internet and indicated that it should try to limit its dependence on the US:
The former entrepreneurs are skeptical about it.
The German parliament calls for the vote that we should make the German Google.
I can just close my eyes and open it a little bit...
This is not a road, says Hasso Plattner, president of the German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, he shouldn't have let him die 20 years ago.
Everything is done in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
The expansion and technical development of the American spy agency revealed by Snowden is for some companies who have recently thought that the biggest threat from monitoring is China, though shocking.
There is a great deal of business in a cloud of accounting techniques where European representatives in a wider range have learned that data stored in the United States fall under foreign jurisdiction and are therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study carried out by Cloud security alliance around 10 per cent of non-American members after the US Prism programme was released, plans to use a cloud supplier with a seat in the United States were cancelled.
Jim Snabe, one of the General Directors of the SAP, says: “We have a new question for customers who were not here a year ago - where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German high officials argue that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to print their most valuable secrets and that data must be protected at every price.
It's not surprising that the economic spy is taking place.
He always did.
"It is a fundamental theme for many years and has not changed significantly even during the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, director-General of the Agrochemical Society BASF.
The Americans are doing spying on us at trade and industry level, as we are doing spying on them because it is in our national interest to protect our businesses.
Under-leaders generally do not want to mix with anti-terrorist measures, which have made it possible to avoid the benefit of the attackers.
In the case of large companies, it has long been remembered that taking on a free USB disk store or leaving unprotected notebooks in the hotel room is minimally unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi Automotive Institute, says that for many years it has been a regular practice to collect mobile phones before the meeting, so that it is not possible to use them as a listening device.
The German authority BfV advises leading staff to consider whether to use mobile phones on foreign routes simply because of the risk that smart phones can be re-enacted.
Prepaid mobile phones will then be released.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies have represented the world market in their specific areas.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access," warns BfV in his report.
The United States protects its own company from economic spying from other countries.
According to a list of US documents, National Intelligence Estamate listed France's border with Russia and Israel in the second series of stakeholders involved in hacking into economic reporting activities, which is now for China.
A member of the Council of the German Free Trade Company concluded that in terms of economic spying, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French Internal Reporting Agency DCRI, announced this month in one of the talks: “The services know very well that all countries, even though they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are working with their allies."
The parents of an unsuspecting boy from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe he was murdered
The parents of a young boy from Georgia whose body was found inside the amputated spirit in his middle school, believe that their son was murdered, said the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on 11 January in a similar spirit at the courts in the middle school where he went.
Sheriff's investigators from the Lounds County concluded that Johnson died of an accident, but the family of a 17-year-old boy refuses to do so.
"They are clearly convinced that their son has been murdered," said lawyer Benjamin Crump, representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson.
They never believed that he died like the sheriff said.
"They are convinced that it contradicts logic, physical laws and also sound understanding," said Crop.
They think it's going to stop what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"As usual, their son was sent to school and he came back to them in search of the dead," he said.
On Thursday, the national representative Michael Moore said he was conducting a regular investigation into Johnson's death, and he noted that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore announced at the press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll be following the fact that they'll take me anywhere.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe there is a sufficient basis for regular investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the original drink indicated that Johnson died as a result of "a half-life".
However, the second drink, according to Moore, introduced another cause of death.
"There are several questions here that must be held or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if Johnson's death reveals sufficient evidence for a criminal investigation or infringement of civil law, the FBI and his execution are required.
The representative of the sheriff's office from the Lawndes district was not immediately available on Thursday for any comment.
The judge from South Georgia in the middle of the authorities ordered all videos from the surveillance cameras to be made available by the investigators.
Young people’s parents hope that their videos will contain a step leading to their son’s death.
The CDC Centre issued a directive on allergic to children
In the centre of the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), a guide file was issued to assist in the case of child food allergy at school.
It is about the first file of such guidelines issued by the U.S. government because the number of school-age children suffering from food allergy is increasing.
One of the 20 children in the United States is allergic to food.
The CDC Centre found that the incidence of food allergy in children rose by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines include information for schools on how the teaching congregation and staff know about child allergic to food and how allergic reactions, if any, react.
The school also recommends that adrenalin – the most commonly used autoinjector of the EpiPen label – be able to react to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
National law authorities have recently updated the rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms that occur in conversations with children who have allergic reactions.
The child can say, "It's like someone pushed me into a language," "I feel like I've got a stupid language" or "I feel a language."
The parents of intersexual children can choose "uninjurious sex"
Germany became the first European nation to recognize the third sex in children born with an unusual sex machine.
Newborn children will no longer be assigned to either male or female sex.
A new law from parents does not require any sex for such children and allows them to be given sex on their birth lists as “unforeseen” or “unspecific”.
The aim of the law is to stop the pressure on parents to decide in their children’s minds for sex surgery and to fight against discrimination against those who are sexually active.
According to BBC, after many years, one person said: “I am neither a man nor a woman."
I'll stay with a doctor who's made up of slathanine, helped and recovered.
It is estimated that every year 2,000 children are born to one who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall into the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, which is achieving the term for those who have atypical chromosomes, sexual glands (vailers or varlets) or unusual genetics.
An intersexual could be Wallis Simpson.
Sex screening is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that if sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information and to identify it instead of waiting and monitoring the psychological and physical development of your child at the time of surgery, if any.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in sex-setting issues, said that the new German law "sees as good."
Intersexual children represent ethical dilemmas.
"Some people are in a life-threatening state that requires surgery, but most children are not," he said.
Sexual harassment can be performed without surgery and can then be expected to develop identity.
The knowledge of how sexual intimacy develops in a child is not very precise.
No one can answer the question why this is happening.
It's like a coincidence why some people are homosexual.
The report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexual persons as different from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not binding on sex but on their biological structure, which is neither exclusively male nor female but typically compatible with both and cannot be clearly defined as either.
These roses may occur in secondary sex characteristics such as the popularity of hair, hair growth, hair loss and shape, primary sexual characteristics, such as multi-ethnic organs and sex organs, or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of discrimination practiced by intersexual and transsexual people in the workplace, as well as levels of burden, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't respond to any sex now have a special team.
Australia and Nepal are already able to mark the official documents of men, women, or "third sex".
Norrie May-Welby, 52-year-old Australia, became the world's first known "unlawful" person in June when she won a court call to be able to leave the status of "uninhibited" sex at the end of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, there will be German passports other than M (men) and F (women) and the third marking, X, for intersex persons.
In neighboring France, according to the French report, 24 problems remain controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strong Catholic country signed a petition to remove “the theory of sex” from school.
The American Catholic website online also broke down the German law and wrote: “With the world being brought to a new state when it is a matter of choice, but sexual activity is not at all, we reverse the charges of two other pillars of civilization."
One mother, who was born in Maryland, also said to baby zone that she would rather see children share sex when they were born.
“Family alone is stressful even without any other restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child,” she said to the parental care website.
Children need stability and security.
Historic children with both male and female sex were called Hermaphrodite, according to the view of the Greek who had two sexes.
And about ten years later, the medical community thought that sex was something like a tablet that could get rid of and reshape again.
But now many have doubts about the ethical basis of the operation because sex is a complex matter and doctors can sometimes decide wrong because they do not know how children will feel as they grow up because of their sex.
"In the half of the 20th century, psychiatric preparedness was called that," Drescher said.
When these kids were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, but a surgeon.
Continual theory on how to deal with children with an unusual sex was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that sex is subjective.
He created a new concept of "captiveness" and argued that social causes and environmental impacts, as parents raised their children, were capable of children's genes and hormones and created a child regardless of whether he was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as "John/John", his theory became controversial.
To the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged because of a misbehavior, he recommended that they let their child go completely, remove his scars and raise him as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of change, but the reality was different," Drescher said.
When he was 15 years old, he allowed himself to undergo surgery again on the boy and married his wife.
In 38 years, however, he saved his life.
Drescher said that some doctors are using the "Tento model" today.
But in the 1990s, with the coming of the Internet, survivors of these operations appeared to be “satisfying with the result”.
It was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male chromosoms, but not a single sex machine.
Doctors were not sure whether he had a big clitor, or a small penis, and were convinced that as a man, he could never live “a calm life. ”
And so soon after his birth in 1976, Bruce's surgical organs and wards were removed and he was raised as a girl.
He got female hormones in 12 years.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," said ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask.
In 18 he was sent to the shower plastic.
But because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was horrible.
I was sterilized after I was born, and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a sex development disorder (DSD), which prevented his body from producing enough testosterone in order to properly develop his sexual organs.
After learning the truth, he changed to his husband, took doses of testosterone, and let himself be removed from his pockets,
The operation caused his infertility.
Today it represents others in the organisation called Interface Project and seeks to normalize the perception of those who are sexually active.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, head of the legal group Advocates for informed choice with a seat in California, fears that the German law “is calling for labelling and stigmatizations”.
"Many activists are afraid that the German law will achieve that it will encourage parents to make quick decisions and choose for the child to be ‘unclean’," she said.
We're afraid it's going to be an intervention.
We think it's better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law ends up, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organisation supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be included in the third section".
"A mature person should be able to make his own decision on the legal basis of his own decision," she said.
The German law wants to share it when it's born.
It's a battle that little child wouldn't have to take away at this moment.
As they grow, they can make their own decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law "gives power" to both parents and children.
The daughter of Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a DSD called an intolerance syndrome on the Androgens.
Because her Androgen receptors are watery, Katie's women's roses have emerged.
He's got a vagina, but he doesn't have a piece and a vegetarian.
Katie is now 29 years old, and she works as a nurse at a university in Pennsylvania.
Although it is infertile, it is hoped that it will become a parent through adoption or replacement.
"The law gives parents a certain space to prevent them from making their decisions," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do some tests and think about them and give them time before they write “husband ” or“ wife. ”
In this regard, everything is fine – you raise and love your child.
You have a wonderful child, and you're happy about it.
You don't have to run an operation that's not coming back.
"It makes it possible to engage in decision-making and child-recognition and to take care of the parents' commitment because they are not sure that they are doing the right thing," she said.
In the end, the child will decide how to deal with me more – and that is a great thing.
It gives children the right to make their own decisions.
The drunk burned the whole house with gasoline: He threatened to burn it with his own family!
The tension grew, the fear grew.
The man started threatening the whole house to burn down.
Instead, all available police surveillance in the environment, as well as a unit of educators from Young Boleslav and a group of volunteers.
He also met a police officer who tried to speak to the man about his irrational behavior.
The man's still threatened to burn down the house.
At home, she had to get into the emergency unit, which the husband was injured and beaten.
The attackor then completed an investigation into a young obese hospital from which he was transferred to an anti-alcoholic hospital.
At last, the Hasichis slept in the house of the police gasoline, with the sorbent who later settled down.
In addition to the property, all domestic animals were preserved.
The man didn't leave the police escort, so the command came after him.
Report: Both campaign was considering changing Biden for Hillary Clinton
The most close adviser to President Barack Bothamy, according to the New York Times, was secretly looking at the candidate for 2012 Vice-President Joe Bidena for Hillary Clinton.
This discovery is the most important sensation ever expected book about the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperina and John Heilemanna "Dubble down: Game Change 2012."
The Times magazine received a copy of the coming books and announced on Thursday evening that the president's senior staff had arranged an intensive group meeting and research at the end of 2011 to find out whether Biden's rescue would help to revive Obama’s bright hope for renewal.
According to a national-political writer for the Times magazine, Jonathan Martina, the book offers a basic record of the strengths of leading officials inside the campaign and in the White House, namely the former head office of Bill Daley's White House, to determine what impact the election would have on the movement of former Foreign Minister Clinton on Vice-Presidents.
The potential change was closely interconnected in the context of the Chicago infrastructure of the campaign and the interior of the Oval work force.
Only a few of the most immediate advisers — including Daley, former leader of Obama's campaign, Jim Messin and former chief advisors in the White House of David Axelrod and David Plouffe — knew that this change was taking place.
The book Double Down claims that Daley was a representative of the power to reward Biden, despite their close personal relationship, and that until the time of the decision not to do so at the time when data showed that the accession of Clinton to the candidate would “Obam’s chance did not significantly increase”.
In his conversation with Martin Daley, the administration actually took into account the revenge of Biden Clinton.
"I've been intensely examining a number of things and this has been one of them," said Daley's letter.
You should not forget that at that time, the president had looked forward, so we said: “Christmas, what are we to do?"
While Daley characterised research as "relevant care", Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the refurbishment campaign had invested little investment to find out whether these were paid in the elections.
"In the campaigns, such money is not available for elections and qualitative research if something really does not apply," Martin on AC360 said.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this change.
Martin told CNN that Daley was wondering if his former boss knew about this potential closure of the card.
While Daley said he didn't think that the president's potential change was "knowledge", the former lead officer admitted that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book “Dubble Down” definitely does not answer the question whether the political probe reached Obama on the table.
Cooper asked Martina if he really thought Obama didn't know about the research on Biden's discharge from the candidate.
"Maybe," answered Martin.
Fantastic ice that shines in the dark?
The British businessman made the first ice cream that shines in the darkness – for the use of the media.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a brilliant memory.
He came up with the idea when he read the expert series on magic and convinced scientists in China to produce a protein that causes light.
This cold reacts to the language of the consumer – increases the pH in the protein and then causes it to burn.
Chris says it's freezing light when he reacts to the heat of your mouth, and the more you lie, the clearer it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice-cream company "Lick me I'm Delicious" (Olyz me, I taste great), says, "It's a great substance, but if it's about the product, we're on the start, so you'll get about 2 g of this product for 200 GBP."
The protein we use in the refrigerator reacts to your tongue when neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms the protein, the pH increases and the cold starts to rise.
We've been testing her for the last few months, and it seems to be a great idea to celebrate Halloween because it causes this fantastic effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the lights are four times more expensive than gold.
And that's how every cup of coffee stands for me is about 140 GBP.
But it's delicious.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual aroma of beer, cheese, honey and golden leaves.
His next product should be more ambitious.
He says, “I would really like to make an invisible cold.”
It's basically impossible because of the part of the light produced by the ice crystal that makes me cold, but I'm counting on some way to do it.
The salt uses fluorescent properties of the media, made by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By number
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
We could eat sweets with our sister, stay up a long time and be with our neighbors in the race.
Today, I feel like I'm getting worried.
After two years there was no sugar in my apartment, and this year is probably not going to be another.
However, statistics show that I'm, when it comes to Halloween, black sheep.
According to the National Trade Federation (NRF) this year, Halloween will celebrate the majority of Americans – in fact 158 million of them – and will lose a total of $6.9 billion for sweetness, costumes and decorations.
But every time it's about Halloween, there's a trend.
According to NRF, it is expected that of $6.9 billion spent on costumes, 1.2 billion will be spent.
This year are the last explosion of the sex mode of non-living objects.
Sexy must no longer be just women; sex can also be eaten as pizza, hamburger and butter.
As far as men are concerned, I expect we will see a lot of zombies through the dead, and I'll bet that the Daft Punk space men will take this year into our channels in Instagram.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with going according to tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes, and we weren't the only ones to my surprise.
In fact, according to the U.S. NRF, this year costs $330 million on pet pet costumes.
So he'll see a lot of fun dogs.
When it comes to sweetness, we don't waste time.
According to the company Nielsen, US$ 1.9 billion is lost.
It's a 300 million kilogram of Hershey tablets, lisats, Milk Duds and Twizzlers and Clark's style.
This is a wonderful report for 41 million colleagues who, according to the US Ministry of Commerce, are going to cross our fourth.
In fact, during Halloween we buy, and you don't believe, and we consume 45 million pounds of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is chicken beans, and yet according to the National Association, sugar is sold around Halloween for almost 16 thousand tons.
It's about 9 billion individual corn beans.
It's the secret I've never solved.
Nothing's more typical for Halloween than scary homes.
They have the best names like "Terror behind the walls" and "The house of shock".
In fact, there are officially dedicated 1200 scary homes in the United States, which, according to the U.S. insurance company, have $500 million worth of cash, and that includes the amazing pictures on which you are facing fear and which your friend will give on Facebook, and you cannot remove them and this person who likes you will look at the photo and sign a comment as "behave yourself in beauty".
And finally, a little bit about the days.
When we were young, Charlie Brown presented us with a big day (Great Pumpkin) and cutting off the rainlight is something like getting a summer tree – we do it from the small.
Luckily for us the trend "child in the day" began with the application Pinterest first Monday, so most of us grew up to be cut off instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. People's Accounting Office, about $106 million will be spent on debt.
The din lighthouse with myothematic flame on your front porch is probably coming from Illinois, where this year has grown 245 thousand tons of daylight.
If you notice something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathhisdon from the town of Napa in California and try to cut off their days weighing almost one ton.

Drew Bowler, Technical Director Bowler Motorsport, said: "The racers who come to Bowler have changed."
Not all are experienced runners, but they are people who want to get excited and volunteer and also reach the path to the race of the world class.
We are pleased that they can offer this route in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to live the various competition disciplines in Britain and will be satisfied, and that it will prepare competitors for the strength and reality of Rally Raid races.
We've really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge car – it's going to be a really exciting competition.
Defender Challenge also offers schools and testing days and also opportunities to compete in deserts in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: For two years here we have early elections
President TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg expects further early elections.
A week after the last talk for Current.cz he said that the other exit is not and each government is different from voting last Friday and Saturday is impossible to hide.
"It can't last a long time," said Karel Schwarzenberg with the idea that the life span of the beginning of the holiday period is about two years.
In view of the fact that voters will choose the next challenge completely, they do not agree: "I think this will be a little more difficult decision."
At the same time, the president of TOP 09 does not agree that his party could lose the vote in other elections as a year (in contrast to 2010 there were 300 thousand votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it is clear in two months that early elections will be held, it will be strengthened by the UN 2011 by Andreje Babies.
In the wrong case, according to Schwarzenberg, Babish will lose.
The Turbulent situation in ČSSD, where President Bohuslav Sobotka, after the Polish meeting of the governing party, announced that he or Michael Hasek, after the meeting of the ruling party, will remain either in the direction of social democracy or in the comments of Schwarzenberg:
"The leading democratic parties as small boys go to the head of the state to enable them to turn to the side."
"I thought Mr. Hashek was smarter and smarter."
"Because I haven't seen anything so hopelessly wrong in my life," added President TOP 09.
And to the President of the Earth (who fought in the war against the presidential function), he said: "The role of the Head of State is clear: He wants to strengthen this party."
The first law has already been submitted by TOP 09.
What happened to you personally the greatest surprise of your choice?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first legislative proposals, in addition to the Farsi Register of Treaties, which were before the elections, but has fallen under the table with previous elections.
President TOP 09 in his speech for Current.cz says that such speed is given by "these laws are necessary".
At the same time, TOP 09 wants to clearly resist similar attempts on the other side.
For example, the voluntary leader of the ANO Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in the pre-trial war of the intention to register the contract "precise" an ANO's campaign.
TOP 09 was now using a jump - just cancelling the proposal that had already been allocated to the second recording reading.
The Hasish units agreed to save the lost wall, which was 15 metres above the ground on a dangerous volcano in the camel.
The anger of Ruby ran after a small car accident.
Three days later, the man who married the dog saw her in the cammeolom.
The Hassics were swimming around the rock wall to save the dog from certain deaths.
The wall was excavated by fire units who agreed to release it after having in some way committed itself to a dangerous explosion in a 15 - foot [15 m] cammeolom above the ground.
The nine - month - old Ruby ran after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and he lived alone for three days until he was released from the truck in the middle.
His owner, Scott Alderson (25) and his friend Becky Hall (20) were at the Flemish Library in Denholm, West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again and to thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
Then, when he got into a small accident, he got angry after his lost dog and put challenges on social networks.
In the middle of the 14th of the 15th century, a schooner named Ruby was looking for a 15 - foot - long [15 m] piece of stone on the ground.
Instead, he ran a technical rescue team from Cleckheaton Fire Station and jumped down to free Ruby, using him to lift up a scale transport bag for animals.
Chief of the technical rescue team, Andy Clayton, said, "The dog was in a dangerous situation.
He was right in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from top and bottom.
When he was saved, he took no bread – he was completely frozen.
But now it's okay.
He's got a date.
It was a very unusual exit.
The fact that the dog looked at someone is unbelievable.
The chief of the technical rescue team, Peter Lau, said: “Ruby was very lucky during his escape. ”
There was a chance that he would be seriously injured or even worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for inspection, and in addition to dehydration and dehydration, he was fine.
Ms. Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "I was afraid of the rescue action."
First of all, I couldn't believe how it got there.
It was wonderful to keep him in the arms again.
The veterinarian said if he was too exhausted and exhausted, he'd probably fall.
The hackers have done great work.
What they did was very brave.
We're very grateful to them, everyone was just huge.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: "We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there."
The Hasichis were great.
We just don't understand how it got there.
Mick Jagger claims that since then, 18-year-old Katy Perry has not left.
During an interview for the Australian voting order this spring star said this week that the song "Old Habits die hard" for Jagger has been sung by a record of successful vocals since 2004.
Perry said when she was 18, she had this year's vet dinner and he followed her.
And he added, "It's been a long time, and now it's very nice to me."
In a statement from Jagger's fourth vice president (70), the representative said that he categorically rejected when he would make Katy Perry's proposals.
The representative said: “Maybe you'll have him with someone else."
Perry was one of the host songs (song) that this year appeared at the Rolling Stones concert hall.
Her new "Prism" album was debuting this week in the first place.
George Keravan: Divided Europe Gives Scots to the Election · Global Voices
The next day, another terrible story of independence.
This time a warning is issued that the condition for the member states of the independent Scotland in the EU would be his entry into Schengen.
This led to stories of passport checks in Berwick and the rest of the road along Hadrian Valley.
It is true that Strathclyde's news mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but, as expected, the news did not pass on to the headlines.
No one has also said that EU Member States are wasting much time by adapting their official laws if they do so.
In view of the fact that Scotland is not now in Schengen, the offer of continuing non-compliance for Brussels would be a cheap way to pay for anything they really want from Scotland.
So it's a pretty bad story.
And so old as it was, I heard from a newspaper newspaper newspaper saying that "independence means passport controls," I heard at least 40 years ago.
However, one interesting idea is hidden in this strange speaker.
Why should it be expected that independent Scotland will listen to Europe?
Why change the London shirt for that Brussels, especially now?
This is a real European story: the great pleasure plan to join Europe has finally been wasted.
The impact of the euro crisis is called the European Project officially dead.
In addition, Europe is affected by the parties committed to the EU or the euro’s cancellation as a joint exchange.
Even in Germany, the European Alternative for Germany – based in this year – has come as soon as possible and has already used nearly five million votes in the final federal elections, which from Bundestag is essentially the Free Democracy (equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats).
At home, there was always opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The resilience of Germany and the European Central Bank, together with the belief that the national economy was being brought together through the fall of June, has led many people to the view that Europe’s project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments manage with a high budgetary deficit – it was only in the case of Greece.
It is more about the euro system, which blocks its members on exchange rates for German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to leave.
Without the possibility of domestic exchanges, southern Europe is in the area of domestic sales to Germany.
The only aid is the short-term income and public expenditure – which Germany spends.
The current problems with the budget and the currency are the deeper cause of European small-scale efficiency.
As a result of the "green" energy policy supported by Brussels – a code to support French and German companies at consumer costs – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as for gasoline as it is in the United States.
This is a paralysing non-expenditure in the area of costs, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Even all the freeze of payments on the world would not restore the collapse of the European petrochemical industry into the left-wing coal from the United States.
As a result, there is an added challenge, especially in France, when the EU is overrun.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that Germany will hold on to the back and enable Paris to stand in the world at Washington level.
However, as a guide of political legitimacy, Paris no longer needs and has left its own economic policy in Europe and the French economy in need of it.
As a result: Marine Le Penové, an anti-European National Front, just won the basic additional elections and withdrew the ruling Socialists to a third place.
The front is now with 24% of the most popular party in France – a temporary warning for British labists that they cannot assume that the right-wing is automatically displayed on the left.
How does Le Penov adapt his new newly acquired popularity between the white working class?
The European elections in the coming year would like to use the European Parliament to create an anti-European block of action against joint changes.
If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely to be, such a block can be dominated first in the history of the European Parliament.
I believe, however, that the growing anti-European feeling and position against joint measles are linked and the euro is losing.
The EU does not disappear, but the change is more liberal in the meaning of 'Europe (superior) nations' already prioritised by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may leave the euro, but France and southern Europe will renew their own changes.
I hope that Great Britain will distance itself from this project and join the United States.
However, the increased interest of Washington about Tichomore indicates that Britain will be left with Atlantic cold.
Where's Scotland?
We can choose to be the area (in principle) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – there is also the possibility of informing Berlin and Brussels when they have to let us be.
I suppose Scotland would have acted well in the free movement of Europe if it had kept its own currency.
Cooperation with other similar thinking countries would be easier in the non-federal Europe of the nations.
In the wrong case, we should take the example from Norway and leave our economic independence.
The government of the SNP in Scotland is the most successful political campaign that has won a large majority in Europe in 2011, thanks to the opposition towards the actions he has planned (and implemented) of the laborist office Alistair Darling and the subsequent coalition of conservatives and liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now voted in favour of independence only in order to take countermeasures by Berlin and Brussels.
Temporary puberty: Adults
The study showed that Africans and Hispanics reach puberty before their white breeds.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is approaching
No evidence of hormonal or other chemical effects has been shown.
The experts claim that one of the providers of early puberty may be an epidemic of obesity.
The trend of early puberty isn't so bad for boys.
The former report CNN Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children’s health and family problems.
Should a mother be afraid when her daughters start growing breast and breast-feeding at 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Child Doctors in Florida this week, a pediatric endocrinologist, Paul Kaplowitz, explained that these physical changes are relatively common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I spent a lot of time with my parents making sure that it was not usually a sign of rapid development towards full puberty," said Kaplowitz
The visible signs of development, such as breast growth, tendoning and in support and body weight, appear early in the girl's life.
In the last four decades, however, there has been only a slight decline in age when it comes to the first menstrual period.
In the United States, the average age of 12.5 is now 12.75 years old in 1970.
"When they start developing breasts, at least two to three years before they reach the first menstrual period," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book “Early puberty and girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem”.
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is time.
It is discussed what actually activates the beginning of puberty, but if growth is achieved by an adult question 8 years ago, the girl is considered to be “pre-expected”.
In most cases the process is slowed down or stopped – which doctors can monitor carefully.
Faster growth may be the reason for endocrinologist to carry out tests for the purpose of eliminating serious problems such as nausea or diabetes.
There are treatments that expect time-consumption and prevent other consequences: early aging, which may eventually lead to the cessation of growth and stress in adulthood.
The recommendations regarding medicines and hormonal treatment are dependent on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and the rate of emotional growth.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
When it comes to finding medicines, Kaplowitz is careful, but he admits that “puberty can solve problems with girls’ behavior and her feelings that they are different from their peers. ”
Understandably, there is another major problem: parents simply do not want their young daughters to have menstrual periods.
"They're worried that he can get sick or how to manage hygiene," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter began to have menstrual periods in 10 years.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstrual periods together, she was not prepared emotionally.
She came from school scared and angry that she's from her friends first.
There are many well-known theories about causes of premature puberty.
However, there is still no relevant evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are at fault.
Boys – like girls – get puberty early.
Caplowitz has been predicting that the most important reason is the epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he assisted in conducting studies in girls from 6 to 9 years of age, which links the body to puberty.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, Africans and Hispanics have the ability to achieve puberty before their white rivals.
The explanations are different.
From a global point of view, it appears that the models of timed puberty are affected by all economic conditions across the atmosphere and beyond the genes.
Next charge: Although boys are already exposed to facial hair and on hand, the trend towards full development of time puberty is not as clear as it is in the girl's face.
Other doctors attending the conference of the American Association of Children's Doctors (AAP) have added to this subject further complexity.
Accomodation and lactation are common even in horses and bats.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the real stage of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist from the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be reluctant to receive advice from their child’s doctor about how to talk to their child.
"It may mean the need to talk to a child before you assume," Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, your child will probably react well.
Girls who develop earlier need to make sure that even if this happens early, this process is a normal part of life.
Hope Konvalink's role as a host.
Does he have a new job?
Herrčka Nadá Konvalink (62) appeared to be an escape in the role of the economy and was very much involved.
That perhaps a beloved Czech heretic would plan to change the profession and become a business in the home?
Hope Konvalink appeared in the James Joyce Irish pub and poured beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I did it right away.
Even my boss offered me a job and I could live with a beer.
But I refused, rather I'd stay in what I'm doing today, in here," she said with Konvalink's smile, which was host to the second year of the operation of the Irish house.
"I like Irish beer and I'm going to give it to Irish whiskey," she made her own sweet cake.
And Nadi's long-lasting friend and colleague Paul New.
I'm after death and I can't cry in my new life.
I've got one beer or one pancake a day, and I'm trying to keep it," added here.
The manufacturers of the aircraft are looking for a wide range of seats, there are large orders
Between the leading aircraft manufacturers, the dispute over the width of the seat in the second class of the long distance flight was heated, which led to a hot exchange of views on the plane show in Dubai this month.
The subject of the dispute is the wide range of seats provided in the distant years for the economic class – not the ones that would normally have taken place by airlines, but its assigned space is the key to the effectiveness of the final flights offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing companies.
Airbus this week called for industrial standards, which would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in the economic class, but the main American river Boeing says they have to decide on this.
The dispute arose at a time when the manufacturers of the aircraft competed in the sale of the largest version of their two-engine long-distance aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the action from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which the last part of the aircraft is distributed – especially if there are 9 or 10 seats next to it – is the basis of economic performance guarantees on the proposals of the new ‘mini-jumbo’ aircraft.
Boeing says that the improved model "777X" transports 406 people in economic settlements with a width of more than 43 cm of 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competitive version of its A350 model transports 350 people in 46 cm of wide economic seats distributed after 9.
The planes often attack each other on technical issues through advertising in professional media.
Airbus is now in front of the plane show in Dubai, where 777X is expected to get traffic with more than 100 orders, appeal directly to the public.
He recently showed what could be the start of a new advertising war when he showed the financials a picture of three people in the restaurant with the title “Would you like to do this? ”
"Boeing promotes long-term flights in seasonier than in regional turbulence flights," Airbus John Leahy said.
The changes in entertainment skills have made people bigger, but the seats in the planes have not changed radically.
From the beginning of 70th century, when Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern air transport, the average American population increased by 10 per cent by 40 to 49 years, according to the U.S. Ministry of Health data.
According to American medical statistics, the average American in the 21st century is 100 cm.
Airbus claims that his rival will hold the concept of a 50-year-old seat when the average width of the new baptized plane was lower.
Airbus claims that it carried out a research that indicates that the expansion of 2.5 cm improved sleep quality by 53 per cent.
Boeing rejects Airbus' seating and says that it is not in the power of aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more than just on the width of the hall.
"It is really about providing air companies with flexibility and enabling them to do things they are convinced must do so to be successful," said expert at the office room Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate what they get.
They know their business better than anyone else.
There is a major area for travelers, but for providers it is a growing problem that can affect the results.
For this purpose, the competition in the orders of aircraft with the estimated trade in the next decade in value at least $700 billion in catalogue prices is sufficient to avoid the use of your US and European exports.
As stated in the June of the Reuters agency, the distribution of seats is exactly what leads to the battle between the last planes.
Like Airbus, Boeing claims that they achieve 20 per cent better efficiency than the leading market representative in this segment in their latest two-engine pilots, the Boeing 777-300ER model with 365 seats.
Boing's performance standards depend on the proportion of the design of the model 777X with 10 seats in rows and 777 with 9 seats in rows.
The profit in unit costs is reduced to 10 cents of the concept.
"The reason why Boeing does this is to speed up more seats and make his planes more competitive than our products," said Kevin Keniston, leading to the comfort of passengers in Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins with 10 seats in order for existing models 777 are in line with that many passengers are for more extensive distribution, which can go hand in hand with lower charges.
"Fourth five centimetres of wide seating would be great for the passengers, but the reality is that from the business perspective of Airbus is a proposal motivated by the threat of model 777," said the expert at the interior of the office of Mary Kirby, the founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing don't add seats, but they offer the air carrier's folder to be able to choose.
The sellers of the aircraft even carry a measuring beam to check the competitive arrangements.
While agreeing, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high noise arrangements for low-cost companies and regional passengers.
Airbus offers model A350 with 10 seats in line, but says he hasn't sold it yet.
The recent Airbus highlighted the need for greater cabin repair by offering some of his planes a wider seat in the streets.
The experts say that without the support of another manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the demand for new industrial standards will remain unsolved, but it can be obtained from sales of 777X.
The number of HIV transmissions exceeded in the Millennium Prize
In the Czech Republic, the number of reported increases each year.
For example, in 2002, the tests confirmed infection in 50 people, 121 years later, and 180 in 2010.
Loni was ordered 212 and agreed on a record number.
"The total number of new diagnosed cases this year is over 200, which I believe is not a mistake," said an expert on the AIDS Miroslav Hlavy problem, who spent the summer with the Prague House of Light for Patients.
According to it, between January and September, 165 HIV patients arrived in the country, 176 of whom were infected during the same period.
From the start of the monitoring to the end of the annual session, HIV was confirmed by 1710 men and 353 women, most of whom were infected in Prague.
Their number in September reached 1005.
In the Middle East, 206 people were infected.
The diagnosis was heard and 156 people from Jihomorav region, 130 from Moravskoslesk or 116 from Austria.
At least the orders came from the High Court, they were 19.
About 88 percent of patients were sexually infected.
Forty people have been raped in the past by blood transfusions.
However, such a case has not appeared in the PRC since the beginning of the test, so over the fourth century.
With the HIV virus, six children were also born, and they were transferred from their mother.
It's not funny in Gravitice's movie, but it looks beautiful, says experts.
Fantastic film from Gravitace's universe was sold in Czech cinema for some time after the prime minister.
He saw him, according to the Union film distributors, nearly 150 thousand fans and he spent over 26 million dollars.
Most of the rating of the image is positive.
Others, however, find certain differences.
Server Lidovky.cz asked experts from a number of astronomers and astrophysics about how they liked the film and whether they saw some of the nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Director of the Star and Planetary Brno): I like scientific-fantastic films that I consider to be modern dreams.
The film Gravitation is not surprising, even though it is formed as a "physically real" presentation.
It's not, but it doesn't mean it would be wrong.
I enjoyed him a lot.
However, you may need Sandry Bullock hair that doesn't seem to be in trouble.
Hubb's space telescopes and the International Space Stations are moving after a wide variety of ordinary tracks, so they can't be seen in one place.
Some admirers of the film count the real side effects and even the whole conduct of fire in the state of nostalgia.
Scafandry wouldn't be able to handle such wounds either.
Herds in Gravitatione film often get into a wheelchair with various items and clothes without any greater difficulty will all remain.
Critics have not been saved or an action package.
So the widespread tragedy on the Earth's usual route is according to some of the indisputable.
Moreover, she wondered why the doctor was sent to the universe to correct the technique.
People on the streets are also concerned about "unreal" behavior.
This is the same way as it would be intended for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the Star and Planetary hl. M. Prahy): I've seen him only on a wide beach, but I can only say that I was upset.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, but science-fiction.
And in such a case, the author has the right (a measure of duty) not to continue to be realistic.
"More than you mentioned, the differences have affected me about how the three-fold designated space station with a degrading level technique (China's latest). "
"The Chinese will last until the end of the decade, and it will probably look better than it's in the movie."
Vladimír Karas (Director of the Astronomic Foundation of the Academy of Sciences): In computerized scenes, the author is very successful in not breaking the physical laws, and thus naturally oriented wild assessment that in various cosmic circles and wars, the moment of error is quite right, said by the speaker of physics, as well as the view on Earth from the universe is very realistic, including thin spheres of atmosphere and polar castles surrounding polar areas.
The differences will certainly be found in the more detailed study.
In addition, when reading comments, I found that the preferred direction of the course of various cosmic waste on a regular basis is to be turned into some scenes rather than actually (from the background to the east).
Jiří Štěpán (employer of the Astronomics Academy of Sciences): Some things have been adapted to their needs, but no fundamental and in the sky, I have not recorded in the film and compared to other films of similar intent, it is seen that the artists have given their attention to the likelihood of the events seen.
From the moments that don't make sense is to name the fact that Hubbl's universe's telescope behaves differently than the ISS orbit.
As a result, the different speeds and rescue operations would not actually be able to run as they were shown in the film.
Then, at the time of the division of Kowalski (Cloney) and Stone (Bullock), I did not realize that the whole ISS would rot, so there is no clear reason for the power of the Kowalski, which causes both actors to leave when they are no longer moving against each other.
New vaccine against nicotine may take away the pleasure from smoking
Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine that can take away the pleasure from smoking cigarettes.
The only vaccine dose has been able to protect the muscles from nicotine addiction.
Before testing people, further tests are needed, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from the Well Cornell Medical School in New York says the first signs are good.
"We certainly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their dependence on nicotine is so strong that all current approaches are overcome," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been developed to send genetic information for the production of antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells that then begin to create a fluid flow of these antibodies.
The antibodies follow all nicotine molecules in the blood vessels and neutralize them before they get into the brain that prevents the smoke from reaching nicotine levels.
In the tests of vaccinated mice that were added to nicotine, they continued their normal activities.
But mice that were not vaccinated “were calming down, ” said researchers, which means that nicotine reached their brain.
Experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines were dropped because they contained antibodies.
The injections should be administered as often as possible to maintain sufficient levels of antibodies, so they proved to be expensive and not practical.
The cost of new vaccines should be much lower because they convert liver cells into antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines for people would be completely safe, they could be given to children before they would have a taste of cigarettes, and it would have been so dependent on nicotine.
But it's much more likely that the cooks would use it to stop.
"They will know that when they start smoking again, they will not have any profits because of nicotine vaccines, and this will help them to escape this crime," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but they caution that further research is needed.
Tripodi claims he'd influence her.
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be examined by the State Committee for Corruption Control.
Former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi announced that he would change the policy of coastal rent at the request of his political adviser Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in the three properties in the government controlled land.
The Independent Counter-Corruption Committee (ICAC) extended its appeal on Friday to whether Mr. Obeid was recruiting several state ministers to hire him at Circular Quay, where the Promises owned two restaurants and cafes, without having to participate after his release in July 2005.
The Committee is now investigating the claim that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's interest in these properties, based on the evidence presented on the previous visit of Mr. Tripodi's lead office, Lynne Ashpole.
During the 2005 talks, the government urged us to go to public competition.
The Germans were against it, and they also wanted longer terms of agreement.
In 2009, the rents for the companies in Circular Quay, which the Promises provided $2.5 million annually, were renewed without the need to participate in public competition.
Mr Tripodi, who served as Minister of Contributions from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a recipient of public competition.
However, he said that the changes were made to Mr. Obeida's request, which, as Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, focused on the government's rental policy.
The record of the talks submitted in the IAC showed talks from August to September 2007 between Mr. Obeid and Mr. Tripodim and Mr. Steve Dunn, the lead officer who came to the referendum after working under Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Division.
"Was it the subject of discussions during these telephone calls on the development of commercial procurement policy?" Deputy Commissioner Anthony Wheely asked Mr. Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but I'm sure not.
It's definitely not between me and Mr. Obeide.
Israeli military planes were attacked for the purpose of Syria, said the responsible officer
On Thursday night, the Israeli military aircraft launched a target at the Syrian port of Lachish, confirming the responsible executive of the Fox News station.
This responsible person did not specifically say what purpose was achieved, but said that he was at least one.
The Press Agency Associated Press states that the objective was to have rockets SA-125 Russian products.
At least twice a year ago, Israel carried out an air raid on the supply of rockets in Syria.
A lot of things have gone wrong, and it's different.
Perhaps the commentator Pečinka spoke in such a way that he agreed to agree with what the President of the Czech Republic had said.
Heytman Chovanec was suspicious of me as soon as he was elected to the presidency, and confirmed it.
Sobotka was always president, and it's the symbol of the ČSSD stay.
The other gentlemen had their weaknesses in mind.
Senator Dienstbier is a fundamental and user-friendly, Vice-President Zaorálek was unable to speak on television.
On the basis of this, I do not see a better chance than that ČSSD proposed as Vice-President of the Senate of Gajdóšk, the only one would not have the initial handle and I think that it would take the standard performance.
It's such a good solution that it's almost supported by someone in charge.
I'm adding that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and to continue without discontinuing the side.
Alena Gaddóškė could without fear establish a minority government with only the blessing of President Babies and without the people, but with the human health minister of Hovorko, who is actually a faithful social democracy.
This minimum government would have great stability because it would implement a proper law on the referendum and thus undertake to support the President of the Okamura Council.
President Babiš would finally deal with the progress of the tax, because he's tough and he's gonna see that it's not going without her.
People wouldn't have problems, because Hovorka is the one who wears the best they have, and they wouldn't be in the government.
It also pays for the UN, even here a valuable minister would be found, but if they reasonably do not want to enter into the risk management, but to provide support, it is also good.
Let's get Alan Gaddóšk!
Foreign workers with visas may be subject to the "rights" test
With the Government's intention to expand police procedures, the "rights" test for foreign workers with visas 457 is considered.
If accepted, the test will be applied through the criteria with a view to preventing programme 457 from being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a last resort for moving family and friend to Australia.
When a government discussion article was issued today, former labist MP Maxine McKeov condemned the government rhetoric of foreign workers with words that it could affect Australian neighbours.
"The statements of 'citizens at the end of the front' and 'first work for Australia' are very unacceptable as long as competitions require a protected labour market," said the Australian-Indian Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the white working force should be protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised if someone in this region had recorded the story of this historic artifact.
The discussion article shall take 12 measures previously taken by former Deputy Minister Chris Bowen.
Deputy Minister of Transport Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where one of the officials applied five of the proposed changes and the others remain to be considered.
If the "rights" criterion is accepted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether "the nomination is entitled to a situation where the candidate is in relation to or in a personal relationship with the owner or the relevant sponsor."
Following previous experiences with companies that were planning to sponsor small numbers of workers but then employed hundreds, the number of visa holders may also be called for.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old man from Sri Lanka, who had suffered from asthma, died suspected of heart disease after having reached an asylum ship on the island this week.
A nine - year - old frightened son traveled to Australia with him, and after his father died in the middle of the night, he was glad to have a mature brother who was also on board.
The Australian authorities with a man rushed to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
The British Government announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 indicates that high-speed services for Scotland and northern England will begin as soon as the first phase is launched in 2026.
The Ministry of Transport of Baroness Kramer said that the project "joins the Great Britain together".
Scotland's Minister of Transport Keith Brown said he had been cooperating with the British government on this plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and West Midlands.
After the phase ends, two will take the line from Manchester to Leeds.
In June the government overestimated the estimated cost of building a high-speed link between London and northern England from $32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British government, which conducted talks with the National Transport Office Transport Scotland, entrusted HS2 to the company to find further rail capacity and the possibility of improving travel time for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London for three hours and less.
Baronka Kramerva said: "Our goal for HS2 is really a national network that better offers Britain and its cities."
We gave SH2 green because the benefit it brings is huge.
Without that, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our railway network.
However, it is also about integration – above all, Great Britain will be better equipped with HS2 with 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
The Scottish government, Keith Brown, Mr Carmichaela, called for "simply" support for the Scottish entry into the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed track has the potential to bring unprecedented economic benefits to Scotland, but it also provides the economic burden of Scotland in the overall case of high-speed railways across Britain."
We therefore cooperate with the British government to explore the possibility of entering the high-speed railway in Scotland and thus bringing all the benefits and supplementing the Glasgov-Edinburg line, which the Scottish government is planning as it plans.
I am pleased to examine the reports on this study together with the British ministers during the next year and the joint decision on further steps.
Together with Bartou, the inspection and analysis of the anti-corruption police were closed.
Information about the arrest of Vita Barty began to spread on Thursday evening when the server sent a message Firstness.cz.
The MF DNES was interested to find out that the case took place at the age of the General Security Inspectorate (GIBS), whose people had to arrest Barta in the centre of Prague.
It was played in front of the Four Seasons hotel.
However, the inspection resolves cases where there are accused police officers, its rights also apply to civilians.
According to MF DNES, one of the officers of the anti-corruption police is a leading analyst and computerist Jan Petržílek.
He worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
The anti-corruption police, Jaroslav Ibehej, refused to comment on the fact that the media must turn directly to the GIBS in this matter.
And her speech inspector, Radka Sandor, did not want to say anything about it, he turned to the City State Representative in Prague.
"We will never comment on this question with regard to the protection of the facts involved," said the spokesman for Štépánka Zenklov.
This non-specific reaction may also lead to the fact that the event took place, but it is in the silence mode that the speaker does not allow to say anything specific.
In a similar situation, Bart's lawyer is Oldrích Chudob.
The media said that Bart's "and in this thing", but since it's about confidential information, Bart's arrest can't confirm or reverse it.
Some media have previously speculated that Bart's arrest could relate to some former police president Petre Lessy.
This was done by Barta, together with former President VV Council John, who was sitting at the head of the Ministry of the Interior.
As a result, the sport that broke down between the expressive Peter Necess and the VV had to be resolved even by President Václav Klaus.
I don't know where this relationship took my person.
No one contacted me, I wasn't listening.
"I really don't know anything about this," IDNES.cz Lessy said.
In January 2011, Lessy became the chief of police.
Officially, Radek John, the real leader of the party, was Barta right then.
Barta has now been candidate for the election for the election, the messenger's mandate has only been silenced - with 175 votes.
The leader of the universe, Tomio Okamura, said he doesn't even know what he's talking about.
"Vit Bárta was one of many candidates on our candidate, and as I said again before the elections, he was not even a member of the Society's direct democracy, Tomia Okamura," he distanced himself from Bárty Okamura, who said before the elections that he had given Bart's candidate space to him because he helped him solve the problem of executives.
Vit Bárta was brought before the court in 2012 with his former associate from VV Jaroslav Škarko.
The rules on the use of electronic devices at the airport will remain in Australia for the time being
Traveling Australian airlines will have to continue to print their tablets and smart phones during the launch and arrival and without prejudice to changes in the United States with a view to measuring the rules on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given the American company space to change its procedures, so the passengers will be able to read electronic books on their devices, watch video or play games during critical flight phases, if the devices remain in the "aircraft" mode.
Travellers can do this during a considerable part of the summer, but many people worry that they can't have access to their electronic books during startup and accession.
The Australian transporters are examining this decision, which requires a great deal of work from American transporters to meet the requirements but have noted that they do not have to change their procedures in the near future.
The Authority for Civil Aviation Safety (CASA) also said that it examined this notification but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of the flight are still in place in Australia.
"CASA currently has no specific provisions governing the use of electronic devices at the airport," he said.
This question is covered by regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure that safety will be maintained throughout the period and that passengers comply with safety instructions received from crew members.
The company Virginia, which had already spoken with CASA about extending its popular entertainment system wi-fi, was requested to change, but notified that the decision of the regulatory authority was detailed.
"We would be pleased if the CASA had carried out an analysis of the authorisation to use electronic devices, because we really think that now that we have (free of charge) improved customer experience," said the speaker.
The Kantas company announced that the current rules will be maintained in the meantime.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices should not be used during the weather and landing, and we do not intend to change it quickly," he said.
The FAO rules apply to American airlines.
But we are still interested in the development of the regulatory area that can be useful for our travel, and we are certainly studying FAO decisions and the reasons behind them.
In the case of air carriers from the United States, the impact of regulations will be reduced by the company and will depend on their old airport park.
The transporters will have to state that their aircraft can tolerate radio transmissions of mobile phones, as well as audit tools, school materials, manual equipment programs and travel information.
"As the airline confirms its fleet tolerances, it may allow passengers to use portable and light electronic devices such as tablets, electronics and smart phones at any sea level," FAO stated.
In rare cases, low visibility of the crew shall be ordered by passengers to perform during the installation.
The Group also recommended that the heavy equipment be safely placed under the seat or in the office area above the head during the flight.
With growing bide, middle classes use suspensions in Singapore
In the shopping center of Bendemeer in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga stops the gold ring, ring and ring so she can pay her daughters school.
"We just bought a house with our husband and I gave it all my money," said Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although every month the administrator receives $2400 (3,000 SGD) and her husband also works, the monthly income is insufficient, she says.
The demand for an area in Southeast Asia – where household debt is increased – is such that the company ValueMax, where a woman carries out her transaction, became a third stop on the bridge in Singapore this week.
The suspension of the mirrors is not only a quick way to pay cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs Amirthalinga – but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Suspects in Singapore usually apply an annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, more than 15.4% of the rate offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a side in the same shopping centre.
However, they have the benefit of not requiring verification of persons (payment history) or evidence of income and can provide a loan faster than banks.
And that is why, as families feel pressure due to rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt, millions are turning to the region.
After five years of possible growth from the global financial crisis and from the Left-Agreed Money Policy in advanced economies, families with low and medium-income families are turned on the ground to deal with the worsening financial situation.
This week's rating agency Standard & Poor's quoted increasing use of credit in households mainly because of increasing loans as a risk factor for the credibility of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia with regard to the gross domestic product.
Malaysia is on the top of the grid with 80 per cent GDP, which is an increase of 60 per cent in 2008.
The economists were also afraid of the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which only this week came from a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed continued poor exports and decreased consumer demand.
"It is important that the rising costs of people from the middle to the lower [primary scale] will try to supplement their income wherever they can," said Song Seng Wun, an economy in the Malaysian CIMB.
Historic high prices of gold in the past two years have contributed to the well-being of people who have stopped their personal property and take advantage of the opportunity to change their family savings.
About 70 per cent of the seats stopped in 200 city halls are made of gold.
People say, the gold price looks good, we'll stop the grandmother's gold necklace and get it back in the next month.
The largest operator stopped in Thailand, EasyMoney, reported a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using it in recent months.
The growth in the steel industry is so great that ValueMax, the operator of the districts in the center of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where there are four sides – but also to Asia, says the Executive Director of the ValueMax Yeah Lee Chingov.
The company will finance this by using 60 per cent of the 66 million SGD that it received this week at the Singapore summit.
While some discontinuing creditors have been subjected to criticism because of high rates, Mrs. Yeah says that the principle offers not only lower rates than the rest of the believers, but also does not directly increase debt.
"The customers stop the items that they already own, and the abuse of personal property does not increase household debt," he says.
In the company, property is increasingly accepted as a means of ensuring short-term, secure financing.
Among those who use drugs are more than just people in financial darkness.
The rich people from Singapore also use the ValueMax sections when they stop the golden flowers or Rolex watches and can reach up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are of all possible measurements.
"It belongs to rich individuals who need short-term loans because of their greedy business or investment, or small businesses who need help with solving problems in their financial way," said Mrs. Yeahvá.
Sometimes they just need money as fast as they can.
A safe package worth $325 million for Tamaman health
The federal government insists that a preserved package of $325 million for infectious diseases in Tasmania contains strict conditions to ensure that the government does not waste its financial resources.
The Federal Ministry of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Australian Union is making “sustained measures” to reverse the crisis caused by the elderly population of the island, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
The financing for four years was decided after government consultations with independent German Ambassador Andrew Wilki.
"The government has come with a necessary rescue package, which, as we believe, will solve specific problems facing the state," said Mrs. Plibersek.
The $325 million package contains $31 million for the patient's request.
Other 2600 operations, including orthopedic operations and emergency operations, will help remove liability.
Money is also available at open clinics in Hobart and Lanceston, better postoperative care, health care training, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic medical records in local hospitals.
"These investments are responding to the thoughts that my former clinical doctors have told me that the best way to help the Tamaman medical system," said Mrs. Plibersek.
The Ministry stressed that the German Government must require a strict accounting and accounting regime.
The state will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive the Australian currency money and to inform each other monthly about where additional funding has been made.
A Tripartite Committee will be set up to ensure that the State provides services as effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would be worthless, “until there is a genuine reform to put a more sustainable foundation for the Islamic public health system”.
Still, he thanked the government for responding to his request for immediate assistance, which he first brought in contact with the president of the government at the beginning of the summer.
"I believe that a federal aid package can free public health from the critical state," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the Government, these additional chosen procedures will be explicitly restored in recent times.
Speaking of the federal opposition in the area of health care, Peter Dutton believes today's statement is only a "nostalgia".
"The reason why I'm here is that the lab took $430 million out of our medical system," said ABC TV.
You can't have a government that picks up about half a billion dollars, and the Australian currency that owes $300 million, and pretends it's good news.
Mr. Dutton called Mrs. Plibersek to guarantee that no dollar from the spare package will be issued for higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Niclaux adapted the new Denise Diderot, which brings exceptional film production and creation of time, but it is also more comfortable than it should be.
They go back to France in the 18th century and tell a funeral story about Suzanne, a young man who is sent to a monastery by his family.
When it breaks out, it is extremely harsh behavior from the criminally abusive mother represented and, for the other, becomes a sexual object.
The film never depends on the warmth or loneliness, and that's his problem.
The official background of this story leads to the fact that even the marvels will experience a similar wearing of a weeded shirt.
Skierals want to get rid of families with children
Syria has destroyed its resources for the production of chemical weapons, says the supervisory authority
Syria destroyed basic equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with flammable gas, said on Thursday the Committee on the Global Control of Chemical Weapons, while outbreaks of exploding conflicts in the north of the country, and this was not far from one of the places where they were stored according to estimates.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group also announced that more than 120 000 citizens had been killed since the beginning of the civil war nearly three years ago.
The notification of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came before 1 November,
the date on which this organisation established, by its seat in Haagu, Damascus, to destroy or prevent the operation of all equipment for the production of chemical weapons and equipment for the mixing of chemical substances for the purpose of creating a liquid gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this in principle of the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damaszek must still start destroying existing weapons and supplies.
It is estimated that this country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including hypertensive and greenhouse gas.
The announcement came at a time when the war in Safira was fought on Thursday, when the expert spoke about the company's seat on the production of chemical weapons and explosives, the Syrian Human Rights Watchant brought to Britain a seat.
A group of activists, who were monitoring the total number of victims through the Syrian network, announced on Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
There must be 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government's side are 29,954 members of the forces of Bashar Asada, 18,678 insurgents and 187 in Lebanese Hizballah.
There must also be 2,202 government passengers and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN organisation claimed that 100 000 people died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict has brought about 2 million citizens to leave the country.
Asad's units have fought in Safira against rebels, many of whom have been associated with Al-Qaida for weeks.
The observer said on Thursday that the losses were on both sides, but she had no specific figures.
The wars were undermining the dangers facing inspectors of chemical weapons who, during their mission, have to deal with the harsh terms of the ongoing civil war in Syria to save the chemical arsenal.
In a statement by the OPCW Office, which is closely working with the UN, it was said that its team is now “responsible to verify – and monitor the destruction – of the Syrian declared basic equipment for production and mixing/fill”.
He added that "no further control activities are currently planned".
Earlier this week, the inspectors said that they had completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 places declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said that because of my concern about security, they were not able to visit two places.
On Thursday, the OPCW stated that these two sites were “repatriated and ... the positions of the chemical weapons programme, which contained, were moved to two other declared sites which were controlled”.
It was not immediately clear whether the facilities in Safire were one of the places that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed to the full destruction plan of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Board next month.
"I complain of the courage and commitment you have shown in fulfilling this most annual mission as this organisation had it," said the observer director Ahmet Uzumcu in his comment by OPCW.
Now, in its third year, they stand against themselves in civil war, especially the Sunni Mosque of the Rebel and Asad government with its security forces, which are full members of the Alawit sect, in relation to Shiaish Islam.
As for further development, Chief of the Observer Rami Abdul Rahman said that in the middle there was a violent explosion within the anti-air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Lakisia.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger over judgment against the founder of the bomb attack on Bali
The survivors and neighbors of 202 persons killed in the Bali bomb attack in 2002 responded to a judgment against the last of the founders who were set before justice and said that the Death Patek had to be corrected.
A flag that spent nearly 10 years on flight as one of the most visible persons in Southeast Asia was sentenced to 20 years in prison for forming an explosive device used in the bombing.
In 15 years, he could be released conditionally.
This 45-year-old man was chased by a gang murder in two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, where 202 people were left dead, including 88 Australians, and many wounded.
He was also closely monitored in several other points of complaint related to terrorism, including a series of bombings at the schools in Indonesia on the night of the year 2000.
The regret required life, although she could insist that a man with the look of "Demolation man" (bourač) receive a death penalty through his story of the expert on the production of explosives.
This decision relived the painful memories of June Corteen, the mother of Perth, who lost their 39-year-olds Jane and Jenny during a terrible attack by Patek and other foundingists almost ten years ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said that Patek should be sentenced to death.
I really think he should go in the footsteps of the others.
Ms. Corteen said to the AAP Agency: "It should be established before the reading is corrected."
Every day I have to live with the fact that I don't see any more grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari club was compared to the country when, on 12 October 2002, only 23 hours after a strong deposit was fired outside the parking lot.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds ago a suicide alert fired a bag full of explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into coma for a month, and while he was kept alive, three times “dead”.
Mr. Hughes said that Pataka should face the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist bunker Jama Islama is responsible for massacres – Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudru – who were corrected four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty as no one.
I'll keep him alive... no reason to keep him alive, it's just not.
It's been 20 years since 202 people have been killed and hundreds of others have been hurt, and it's not that much.
The Patek stood before the court as the last of the agents on Bali.
The arrest was held almost ten years ago, but finally in January 2011, it was found in the Pakistan City of Abbottábad, where the former U.S. leader Al-Qaida killed Usama bin Ládin in less than four months later.
During the trial, a FBI agent announced in his testimony that the reports of the reporting services revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-connect between terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and Al-Qaido.
"He did not give up voluntarily," said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he has not felt sorry for how much jealousy he caused another man.
The Verdit comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack that will be later this year and which will be attended by the ceremony in Bali and Australia.
"We will see a lot of sludge this year," said Mrs. Corteen.
The flag may still object to the decision.
FAA: Travellers can now use technical expenses (but must not call from their mobile phones)
Air carriers will be able to use their electronic equipment “from the front to the front” – in addition to calling from their mobile phones – to read, play her, watch movies and listen to music based on unexpected new rules issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
Travelers, however, should not expect changes to take place immediately.
As soon as changes will be introduced according to individual airlines, FAO administrator Michael Huerta said at the press conference.
Air carriers will have to submit the FAA management, so that their flights comply with the new rules and that they have updated the training tools for the deck crew and the equipment management guidelines in order to comply with the new rules.
The FAA indicated that it had already obtained plans from some airlines to expand the use of mobile electronic devices in airports.
Among the companies that have already submitted plans are Delta and JetBlue.
"On the basis of the status of such a plan, we can improve the increased use of electronic devices very quickly," FAO stated in its statement.
Currently, passengers are required to complete their smart phones, tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the airport are closed.
They cannot be stopped until the aircraft reaches a height of 3 km and the captain does not grant permission.
From passengers it is expected that their equipment will be re-examined when the aircraft is ready to arrive and will not close until the aircraft is on the ground.
According to the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic pollution may allow their passengers to use their equipment during the flight, arrival and exercise, the FAA has indicated.
Most of the new transport aircraft and other aircraft that were designed to enable passengers to use Wifi at higher sea level are expected to meet this criterion.
Laura Gladings, president of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the change.
"When new rules are implemented safely – and we will work closely with transport companies – this will be a success," said Gladings in his statement.
We have already been told honestly that we look like “watchers. ”
However, surfing on the Internet, sending e-mails and text messages or storing data will continue to be prohibited under 3 km above sea level, the Agency said.
Travellers will be notified to turn their smart phones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no Words with friends, online game type of scribble that Alex Baldwin played on his smart phone in 2011, when he was, as well known, taken from American Airlines airport because he refused to turn off his equipment when the plane was parked in the gate.
And harder devices like notebooks will have to be kept for fear that they might hurt someone if they flew into the cabin.
The phone calls will continue to be banned.
The rules for using mobile phones do not concern FAA, but the United States Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may cancel a ban on certain electronic devices during the inspection and accession.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Security Committee, a national security expert at CBS News, said mobile phones are still considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create pollution with navigational devices, but from the FCC data we also know that they can cause air pollution in the air," Rosenker said.
The Advisory Committee established by FAO to investigate this problem, proposed last month to allow the government to make greater use of electronic devices.
In recent years, the FAA has been subjected to pressure to reduce restrictions on their use.
Critics, like Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, claim that there is no legitimate reason for this ban.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult because the use of such devices is universal.
Some studies indicate that up to three thirds of the passengers forget or ignore their equipment.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices travelling in 1966 in response to the destruction of navigation and communication equipment when passengers started carrying FM radio, the technical costs of the time.
New airlines are much more dedicated to electrical systems than previous generations, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA management to be free from electronic pollution.
A few years ago, airlines have offered the travel use of Wi-Fi in the seaports.
Plans for Wi-Fi systems are also easier to deal with.
A large majority of airlines should be able to make more use of electronic devices within the framework of the new rules, Huertov said.
Modern electronic devices generally produce much less intensive radio transmission than those of previous generations.
For example, electronic readers only issue minimal transmissions when turning pages.
But the transmission is stronger when devices arrive or send data.
Among those who insist on releasing restrictions on the use of these travel devices is Amazon.com.
In 2011, the representatives of this company submitted a transport aircraft to their electronic readers, Kindle, and carried out an experimental flight, but no problem arose.
The members of the FAO Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these devices represent any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National passenger Association of airlines said it is convinced that the destruction of these devices is real, and even if the risk is minimal.
The other members of the committee said that there were only extraterrestrial reports from pilots that should support the fact that such devices could cause damage to aircraft systems, and most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAO pilots be allowed to order passengers to avoid devices during flight according to low visibility devices.
The road industry group welcomed these changes and it said that it was a reasonable procedure for the travel public that technology used in a fair way.
"We are pleased that FAO has recognized that a pleasant travel experience is not in conflict with security," said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was transported from a garden in the North Sea and released back to nature
The bird was transported to the coast after it was found on a rocky plain in the Black Sea and released back into the free zone.
One baptized man was transferred to Aberdeen last month, which had previously been cured by the Scottish SPCA in a safe medium until he recovered.
Colin Seddon said: “This Christian has probably migrated from northern Europe when he has caught a strong wind over the North Sea."
According to everything, his strength came and he's probably found it on the robin floor.
Mr. Seddon added: "It was not possible to re-examination, so we were contacted by applications for help."
When he was baptized, he was in good condition and health.
Is the European elite ready for trade with Britain?
The British Business campaign was launched in depth with the commitment to connect companies and define what changes in the EU are to see British entrepreneurs and companies creating jobs.
To this end, we conducted the biggest and most complex research that we asked the former British entrepreneurs about Britain, trade and the EU's views.
YouGov asked 1,000 leading companies representing British companies of the most diverse sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the study will be surprising.
We have found that most businesses are now trying to export wood outside Europe and focus on the countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states are growing.
They want to see how the government improves new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than lead to a long-term and ambitious process of reforming the secret European institutions.
When we asked about their views on specific political areas, from the monopolical regulations under the product law, most entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
Panovala’s general disagreement with the single market and the entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels regulations now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European trade area – the agreement has been reached by up to 40 per cent of large companies, and thus traditionally the most pro-European companies.
And in the end, our research of leading companies has given rise to the most explicit recognition, and the single majority wants Britain to change the Treaty and the relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The finding with which businesses of different sizes and the main business group have been challenged indicates that the business sector is pressing on "simply change", which affects Britain back.
There are many – the achievement of changes to the Treaty and better agreements for Britain can mean a profit up to 16% when voting in a referendum for stay in the EU.
The President of the Government should not worry: this study shows that the British trade supports its plan to update the British membership's conditions in the EU.
It also shows that the business sector expects this innovation to mean a significant slowdown from the current export of force back to Britain.
A better agreement for Britain is possible, and given how the euro area is becoming more and more necessary for the economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, and as the results of our research show, this means refocusing on trade and fundamental change in Brussels's regulatory approach.
John Kerry confessed, the spying went too far!
The United States launched a "too far" campaign, according to the AFP agency chief of the American diplomat John Kerry during a video conference between Washington and London.
However, according to the Minister, the information collection served to eliminate terrorist attacks.
According to the AFP, "the first recognition from Washington" was launched in the middle of a preliminary policy on both coastal Atlantic due to the scandalous data collected by the US National Security Agency (NSA), which was also the target of the American alliance.
"In some cases, I agree, just as President Barack Obama did, some of these actions have gone too far and we assure it will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
But in his speech, he was primarily exaggerating the practice.
The collection of information is necessary for combating terrorism and banning attacks, such as attacks from 11 September 2001 in the United States, attacks in Madrid in March 2004 or London in July 2005.
"We prevented the planes from falling, the buildings were bombed and the people were killed because we were able to be informed about the records at the time," Kerry emphasized.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases went far too far".

Alexei Miller from Gazprom says he's trying to find a new gas era in Bulgaria.
The launch of the South Stream pipeline building in Bulgaria means the launch of one of the largest European energy projects, said Director Gazprom.
"We are witnesses to the border today: the construction of the Bulgarian part of the South Stream, the largest and most important project in Europe," said President Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement.
This project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent.
The demand for South Stream should add diversity to Russian export routes across Europe.
The agreement between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of the Russian oil to Europe, adds the risk of conventional routes, says officials.
Miller says that direct contact with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with the transit countries are “permanently” removed.
As the entire project begins its operation in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at reduced prices.
The Gazprom company says that the construction in other countries is going to begin at the end of this year.
The annual capacity of 2.2 billion cross-sections of the earth's surface is proposed.
Hizballah sent thousands of warriors to Syria.
He's waiting for a decisive battle.
The Lebanese army of Hizballah has deployed 15,000 of its warriors north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle on the Horn of Kalamun.
According to Israel’s telling messages, during the mid - flight to two places in western Syria, he destroyed the rockets set right at Hizballah.
This Lebanese Shiikh organization is fighting in Syria on the side of foreign armies.
Its programme is also a fight against Israel, which is not involved in the Syrian conflict, but clearly stated that it would prevent the arms of Hizballah from moving into Lebanon.
The reports of Israel's medium-sized arms embargoes in western Syria are first clarified.
Israel’s attack did not comment, but it was confirmed by American sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, rockets fired from the Mediterranean Sea by the Syrian rocket base Snúbar Jjabla south of Latvia.
The Al-Arab reporting station claims that there were two stocks in which rockets were prepared for transport to Lebanon.
According to her sources, it was about the rockets of the Russian product SA-8.
Israel refused to comment, but military analyst Ron Ben Jishaj said Syria is constantly trying to protect Hizballah rockets and Syrian rockets will teach members of the Hizballah armed section to handle rockets.
SA-8 are old rockets that have a Syrian army since the '80s.
They're placed on a moving trailer.
Although they are relatively primitive, thanks to mobility and small sizes it is easy to hide them.
They're equipped with a radar that will go off after the fire, so it's hard to measure them.
Latakia lies in western Syria, in the area inhabited by ruling aquifers.
It is a well-known area, and in the past, Hizballah was just sharing in the wars in western Syria.
He claims to help protect the Syrian Shiite community, which belongs to the Aleutian community.
Now there are some 15,000 of his warriors ready to help get the army back to Kalamón.
Together with Hizballah there, he also strengthens his troops by means of the Syrian army.
Kalamun lies between Damascus and the third largest city of the country of Homs.
The battle must be based on the source of al-Arabia to warn of a recent attack on the leadership of the Syrian Chinese Brigadiers of Fadla Abbáse in the Chinese part of Damascus.
Hizballah helped the Syrian army this year to fight back the city of Kussir at the Lebanese border.
Many rebels from Kussyar went straight to Kalamun.
More recently it seemed that most citizens in the Czech Republic had made an early election.
As a result, corruption, the distribution of money for oversales and state contracts, tax increases and in the latest series of government scandals were introduced.
According to the results of the elections, the majority of the citizens expressed the view.
That it did not matter to them, and the attitude they had here (the theft and liability of this State) was really satisfied.
Otherwise, I can't explain that 3,413,497 voters were not delivered to elections, 596,357 voters voted TOP 09 384 174 voters, and 4,394 028 actually supported the original government coalition, representing 52.16% of all voters.
Which is the majority of them.
When the above-mentioned party included 1 016 829 ČSSD voters, then the old order (because all parties involved in the "selling" and subsidisation of the State), then 64.23% of the eligible voters agreed with this position.
In fact, most voters have made it clear that they are not responsible for fraud and fraud in this country.
Or do you think the members of the ČSSD who shared the principle of mutual law?
Is there any help for us?

The Royal Commission found that two employees of the Christian Association of Young Men (YMCA) were charged with complaints against Jonathan Lord
The Royal Committee on Sexual Exploitation of Children found that prior to the accusation against child abuse by Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Christian Youth Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were charged with child sexual abuse.
However, the Commission found that in its initial statement to the Commission, the association indicated that in its organisation there was never a case of sexual abuse of a child.
The executive director Phillip Hare was questioned when one of the employees of YMCA was accused of child pornography abuses and the other when a television director in Caringbah from YMCA was sentenced in 1991 to sexual harassment of children in his care.
Mr. Hare told the Commissioner, Gail Furness, that he knew about the first case, but not about the second one.
He admitted that the initial declaration of the YMCA association was also unclear when it indicated that external audits were carried out in the YMCA organisation that were assessed by this organisation as the previous suspension of the rights of the child.
The evidence submitted by the Commission is that the YMCA was advised that the Ministry of Education and Society audit held the second of the four possible evaluations this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working with YMCA when he was 21, admitted that his guidance was delayed when Mr. Lorda accepted without checking whether his staff knew the obligation to report a violation of the rules on child safety.
Earlier this year, Lord was sentenced to sexual harassment of 12 boys who were allowed to work in YMCA for two years.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
Mr. Hare, however, rejected the claim that the YMCA association had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting to Mr. Lordem's children's safety.
Members of the staff gave evidence that they were witnesses of such abuses, including that Lord was with the children on his own, that he was watching them, that he would let them sit on his lap, that he would like them, and that he would let them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's assistant and asked for training for the safety of the children because she cared for his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, leading the children's services at YMCA in the city of Caringbah, who was Lord's superior, was “very scary and often difficult to talk to him about. ”
The Director-General said he did not accept the evidence of his staff that he felt guilty if they should contact his superiors and report the results.
Instead, he said that their friendship with Lord had blinded their judgment, and that is why they had no problem.
Mr. Hare said that the board of YMCA in New South Wales had expressed its opinion that learning from the "Jonathan Lorda's case" for the organization was based on the fact that the staff "did not give a message", and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to allow staff to sign the agreement on the maintenance of silence shortly after the charges were made by the General Manager for Children's Services in YMCA Liam Whitley.
He said that the objective was to avoid breach of the evidence, but it was “slowly hot” and was wrong.
Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University has told the Commission that YMCA in New South Wales was not an organization that would be safe for children in 2009 to 2011.
He said there were serious problems in the congregation, checking, processing, training and staffing.
The hearing was suspended on 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return to the post of the Prime Minister, but admitted that the return is unlikely.
During the night conversation on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his resignation from the 59-year policy office, he expressed his views on the various areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, when he left the lead position ten years later, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussions on British politics and has limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role in the release of the Biscadian Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of the Prime Minister, his answer to the London newspaper Evening Standard read: “Yes, of course, but it will probably be difficult to do so, so...”
While in Cardiff, experts gathered to present horses to fight the price of the Year, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was prepared for the third year of Fenton Kirkland.
Although he was not yet going to school and just a few months ago made the first steps, this boy and his animal pet, the Shetland Toffee poet, the chillers pushed three cars to finally get the main price and left 30 attractive adults behind.
This undisputed couple – with the same height – were held at each year’s competition at the Sunnybank railway centre in the village of Rudry near Cardiff, commended for the appearance, behavior and style.
He set himself against the lords and ladies in elegant clasps, pushed his bar into a happy field and let his two-year-old Toffey walk around the circle.
Fenton was commended for his natural ability to control horses that far exceed his age.
And Toffee's got the highest marks for the look and personality.
Fenton Toffee was born in March to his third birthday, and since that time, he has been playing with this Shetland poet every day.
His mother, Donna (30), said: "Fenton and Toffee are doing great cooperation."
They didn't have a great hope, but they finally left with a gold ring and a kiss.
It was the very opposite of what he was competing with Toffe, and when he won, we were overcrowded.
They all considered him a phenomenal and all other people wanted to take pictures with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales comes at the feet of his aunt Sharon Howells, who holds horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells says: "There was a rising atmosphere and everyone was excited and tired."
He ran after the sand all the way through the arena and, although he did so little, gave a great performance.
Fenton is owned by animals – he loves horses, tractors and farm and has reached the age of two cooks.
In view of the way he started, it'll be soon for the King's competition next year, and I'm sure he'll do well.
The speaker’s annual horse competition said: “Fentons are only three, but he already knows how to control the pony. ”
They're creating a great team together.
The natives brought out Fenton and Toffey for their outstanding performances and the way they were presented in the competitive environment.
They're always watching how well the team's work is between the ponies and those who take it – and Fenton and Toffe were the best at this point.
I'm sure Fenton helped out with the nice clothes, he really fell in there with him.
Too many strange news should be checked
The Chinese newspaper, which on the title page requested the release of a reporter accused of fraud, will be thoroughly investigated, said the printer manager.
Newspaper New Express, sitting in Guangzhou, made a rather public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken payments to think about the company's stories partly owned by the State.
The rapporteur said that the New Express newspaper will now carry out "full adjustment".
The regulation for "correction" came from the State Administration for Printing and Publications, Advertising, Film and Television in the province of Kuang-tung.
The preliminary investigation showed that during the period from September 2012 to August 2013, New Express from the kanchengska group Evening News issued several false reports on the company Zoomlion.
"The editorship of the New Express news was not organized," the manager said in his statement.
He said he had to "put Chen Yongzhou's administrative penalty in the form of a cancellation of a press licence".
He also “commanded the kancheng group Evening News to complete the New Express list, and recommended that the responsible members of the New Express check the New Express and immediately change the New Express guide. ”
Mr. Chen wrote for New Express several articles dealing with financial differences in the company with the construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his papers published two applications for his release on the title page and claimed they were standing for his press work.
Mr. Chen, however, appeared on state television and admitted that he was paying for false stories.
"In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion and to the entire media sector and its ability to build confidence in the public," said the CCTV State Reporting Station.
I've done it mainly because I've been collecting money and fame.
I realize I was wrong.
After Mr. Chen's apology, he issued a New Express letter on the title page stating that he had failed without sufficient control of his message.
In recent times, a number of closely followed suspects have been admitted on television.
The experts say that the recognition is still made regularly, regardless of the change of the year's law, which prohibits the authorities from using anyone to charge themselves.
Found a tunnel for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico with its own railways
One of the most creative tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, complemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electric rails, was revealed.
The U.S. authorities described the tunnel of noise dimensions once a meter as one of the most mysterious secrets they've ever discovered.
The tunnel, which is located in the length of almost six football fields, connects the warehouse near Tijuan in Mexico and San Diego in the United States.
This area is full of unencumbered warehouses, where it can easily hide the cost vehicles before drug use.
The authorities indicated that the tunnel was closed before drug delivery could be carried out.
The authorities also held eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, along with the appearance of the tunnel of the authorities.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were charged with holding marijuana and cocaine with the aim of distributing it.
In the event of a judgment, the penalties for the removal of liberty from 10 years to life shall be imposed.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, the feeders enter large waterways.
The tunnel is the eighth largest tunnel in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels have been discovered in October after marijuana in central Mexico, which poses a problem before drug cartels as soon as they get their product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a walk some 650 metres long with trains equipped from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
The economy and the Centre offer management.
Offering, for example, a joint insertation
The new integrated newsroom of the Economic Society in the Persian Carolina.
The Economy has taken another step towards transforming the Centre into its media home.
From the dock, the Economics and the Centre has a joint top management.
"The integration of the organisational structure and the staff of the Union is essential for the integration of both publishers into the common media home," comments made by the Vice-President of the Economic and Social Council and Director-General Kamil Čermák.
The German who will be in charge of the single management will be the Executive Director of the Centre Holdings Andreas Demuth.
Paul Voparíl, a new trade manager, was appointed by the director of the two company Zuzana Tilcher.
The new head of information technology became Stépán Burd.
The editor is Vladimír Piscáček, whose team is also the editor of the Jakub Unger transformation.
The new set-up function of the marketing director was entrusted to Adela Pitts.
A self-defence of corporate communication is the new leader of the Lothsk Group.
The co-financed director is Karel Žalud, the management of human resources for both publishings leads Petra Slaba.
"The new organisational structure allows us to access the market with a joint offer of inert products, better promote the creation of the content of all the titles issued and, in the latter, further significantly strengthen the business management of the company," added Germany.
The Economic Company, which owns Zdeněk Bakala, concluded a contract on the purchase of Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of the year.
Portfolio Centrum Holdings creates servers Current.cz, Žena.cz, web portals, wide email base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najisto or portfolio of other minors two dozen smaller websites.
The Economic Society is the publisher of economic news, the IHNED.cz reporting server, the Respect and Economic Weeks and the number of printed and internet B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers is the longest successful sales of digital versions of their main titles.
This year, in June, the publisher moved to the newly built modern spaces in the Persian Karlin.
CME's on TV business.
He'll miss almost a quarter of the people.
The media group of CMEs will be missing.
By the end of the year, he's trying to feed thousands of people.
He's got all his next activities and wants to focus only on his main business, television.
The group, which owns Nova TV in Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of 4,500 people.
That's how it's going to be for almost a quarter of people.
The media group operates televisions in the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
The CME is the company CET 21, which holds a license to send television stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smichov, Telka and Czech version of the MTV station.
How much opposition will affect Česka, where the group employs a total of 650 people, and what this will mean for the Turkish TV TV unit Nova, it is still not clear.
"It's early and we can't really comment on it," said communications director Novy Josef Koukoliček.
According to the MF DNES information, the express release of Czech Republic will certainly not be exempt, but far from the greatest impact it should have on the CME’s staff status in Romania and other countries.
Both New Chiefs of News Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who came after long-term director Adrian Sarbu's interview with the analysts, spoke about their intention to limit all activities that are not directly related to the television industry.
It is, therefore, quite likely, that it will significantly limit costs for the production of its own orders, film and production activities.
In the industrial area of ČKD in Prague in the cold night
In the industrial area of the ČKD in Prague, a high-capacitated container was burned, according to researchers, apparently a cold glass.
"The fire broke out on Thursday night before eleven hours of night, the fire was still burning today," reported Paulina Adamc's Polish educators.
The amount of damage in the air in the environment was not exceeded by the allowed limit, according to the measurement.
More damage and fire causes are still unknown.
To the area in the Colbeno street, the noise gradually reached five tenths of the impactor.
"It's about the fire of a large-capacitated container, probably a refrigerator," Adamc said.
"In the area, there is no functional hydrant network, so we're going to have a driving drive from the tank," she added.
According to the tn.cz server, the drying of the badly functioning hydrant network has been complicated, so they had to get water out of it.
The director of the fire department announced the second level of fire alarm.
They're almost four, and in the most important situations, they're four.
Chemicals have also been released to verify the measurement of dangerous substances that could be obtained in the fire.
"They did not, however, target the air level of harmful substances that would violate hygiene standards," said the speaker.
The British police gave Assange a notice on issue
The British police have today issued a notice of the release of the warehouse manager WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who found refuge on an Ecuadorian island in London, where he asked for asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that for 40 years, Australia had given "a notice of expulsion" by asking him to get to the police station and that if he does not, he could be threatened by arrest.
Assange, under British law, exhausted his chances when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against the issue this month, and so he was going to Sweden because of his sexual crimes.
Because he was afraid that Stockholm would send him to the United States, he was looking for an emergency camp on 19 June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he asked for asylum in South America.
Scotland Yard "has given notice of a 40-year-old man asking to be sent to the police station on the day and hour he was assigned," said the speaker.
Assange continues to violate conditions of imprisonment.
The majority refused to comment on the notification of the issue.
Assange is afraid to be released from Sweden to the United States, where he may be accused of spying because on the WikiLeaks website he published 250,000 American diplomatic documents.
The driver received 1,000 pounds for eating over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs
The motorist was caught 1,000 pounds because he walked up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie (35) from Tiptree, Essexu, was a 27th-century visitor to Mercedes Benz on A120 in Braintree.
When the police stopped him, they found out that he had the same drink between them.
In the Colchester Court of Justice, Howie admitted to the charge that he was being conducted in an unattended and unattended manner.
Seven points were reached on his account, as a result of which he received a six-month order.
Howie was also ordered to pay the costs of 90 pounds and a fine for the 100 pounds charged.
As a result of tax on foreign property owners, the Polish bublin
The Ministry of Finance initially calculated the tax on the profit of the financial property, but is waiting for the final decision of Mr Osborne, which, in the 2012 budget, represented 7 % of the rent for buildings at the price of more than 2 million pounds and annual payments for buyers who own their properties in the company, never as individuals.
The result of the transfer of property to the housing fund in the Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea periods, which reached 708 million pounds in 2012/13, has exceeded the total account for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North West, North West and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr. Cook said: "In view of the increase in property transfer in houses of high value and the representation of legislation that should prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that property of high value is low regardless of the effect of the old tax system on the head."
He added that "this step could have caused some foreign investors to attract property in London to buy, if any, to sell existing owners."
The previous properties – 5 % to 10 % of the price-by-value housing market – in the rich sand that flows from Fulham to Wimbledon, reported an increase of 11.8 % over the last year.
Prices in the middle of London continue to show a steady growth of 5.6 % since the year, but were replaced by the rising "home market", which, according to the study of the Savilles Real Office, experienced a rise in the South, North (7.4%) and East (6.5%).
Scientists have shed more light on how the motions of the ocean are related to the catchment of dogs.
Previous studies have shown that happy dogs turn more transport (from dog to dog) while nervous dogs have too much left.
Now, however, scientists say that the other dogs are able to record and react to these fascinating differences in the movement of the species.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at Trent University, said: “People are well aware that the left and right sides of the brain have a wide range of connections to activities that stimulate positive or negative emotions."
That's what we've been trying to warn other people.
He added that just as it is in humans, and in dogs, the right side of the brain is responsible for left movement and yet, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to obtain further information on how dogs react to the inadvertent return of other dogs, researchers have monitored animals watching movies of other dogs.
They measured the temperature frequency of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
Obviously, it won't last long before we understand why their eyes are sometimes on the one side and the other on the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have missed dogs of dogs – either in a natural version or like a silhouette – in order to save ourselves from any munitions, and we have also been able to correct the movement of the hair and notice it more directly or to the left."
When the animals saw another invisible dog move through the water of transport (from the point of view of the dog returning the ocean), they remained calm.
However, when she noted the weighting of the tail too much (review of the dog returning the tail), their fat rate increased and the animal did not make it certain.
Professor Valortigara said he didn't think dogs would communicate with each other knowingly through these movements.
Rather, it is thought that dogs have learned from experience what moves they must move and what they must not pay attention to.
He said: “If you meet dogs several times and the movement of their bodies in one direction is repeatedly linked to friendly behavior and the movement of transport produces less friendly behavior, you will respond on the basis of this experience. ”
Researchers say that finding can help dogs, veterinarians and fungi better understand their emotions.
John Bradshaw, professor of dog behavior at the University of Bristol, said it wasn't the first study to find out whether it's the left and right side of the dog is important.
Last year the Lincoln University team found that dogs turn their head left when they watch aggressive dog, and the device when they look at happy dog.
And in another expert meeting at Victoria University in Canada, he said: “The dog was registered with a dog with greater probability when he returned to his father on the left than when he became more insecure – exactly contrary to Italian studies. ”
The difference, according to him, may be that dogs in these different animal studies in movies or animals have not appeared entirely like dogs.
He explained that it could help study how dogs react to real dogs.
"While there is ample evidence that both sides of the brain are used for various purposes, many details still need to be explained – and dogs are not the exception," he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it's probably not going to last long before we understand why their eyes sometimes go on one side and the other on the other.
Arctic Monkeys because of Alexe Turner's failures moved a concert in Glasgow
The Rocky Arctic Monkeys hosted a concert in Glasgov after the main singer was diagnosed with carnage.
The Sheffield Group was supposed to be in the city complex on Friday.
The lack of main song Alexa Turner, however, led to her being expelled.
The notification of the group was followed by a similar presentation of the fourth appearance in the LG arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official websites, Arctic Monkeys says: “After the decision to postpone today's LG exposure in Birmingham, and on the basis of medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also defer to the Hydro complex in Glasgow planned on Friday 1 November.”
"Alexi Turner was diagnosed with a heart attack, and unfortunately he will not be able to show."
The exhibition in the LG arena in Birmingham on 20 November and the exhibition in the Hydro complex on 21 November.
All the leaves on this show remain in place.
We would like to apologize to everyone who bought the tickets, for the inconveniences it has caused them.

Pope Frantisek named himself the first cardinal
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis 22 was the first to name the new cardinals of the Catholic Church.
Cardinals have the highest position in the Catholic Church right after the pope and are those who love the pope, so Frantisek will establish his first group of men who will finally help choose his successor.
Now there's 201 cardinals.
However, once the cardinal reaches 80 years of age, he can no longer participate in the pope’s elections – the group thus reduces to 120 cardinals.
In a statement announcing this report, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that before the celebration of the new cardinals, the gathering of the current cardinals will be known as a consistory.
"Papèž František decided to give his decision to allow the U.S. Consistency to facilitate the planning of other gatherings that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero, from the list of Catholic voices, said that the number of volunteer cardinals into the U.S. is probably pretty good.
He said that the pope usually refers to as many cardinals as it is necessary to increase the number of voters to 120 again, and as many cardinals over 80 years of age, as much as he wants.
The concert hall next year will be important because it will be the first time that Frantisek was elected in March of this year, Valero said.
At this time certain orientations are being made for Europe and for Italy in particular.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope appoints cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they only have an odd number of cardinals.
It will also discuss the first election of cardinals from the time that František established the Cardinals Council, a group of eight cardinals from around the world, to find ways to reform the church.
In the past, the pope had decided everything for himself.
"Ninní Frantisek chose these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He said it's "as far as possible" that these cardinals ask for advice.
In this situation, we have not been before – this is the most simple news.
Valero said that the popes traditionally raised cardinals from large places, but František is “full surprise – so we don’t know who’s calling.”
GM holds some new easy-to-cost car in the USA because of the repair of the seating equipment
According to the United States Car Safety Authority, the General Motors is about 19,000 of its new (2014) low cost cars Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra to engage in manual repair operations.
Some of these vehicles may have a mechanism to adjust the front seat of the vehicle.
As a result, seat belts are not in accordance with the federal standards of car safety for head belts.
A notice posted on the website of the National Transport Safety Administration (NHTSA) says that “if the rear car is delivered immediately, the head restraint must not be properly protected, which increases the risk of injury”.
Loaded models were made between 1 August and 10 September.
GM introduced a supply to the market in June, and for this former American car, the most important introduction of vehicles to the market from post-banking in 2009.
The GM company informed the owners of the undertaking in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not examine the notification to the owners due to the 16-day government's ineffectiveness which had weakened the growth of car sales in October.
The sales of the supply of Silvero and Sierra, which were processed for the 2014 models, rose to approximately 20 per cent in the first 10 months of this year by GM on Friday.
In October GM sold from its supplies 42 660 Silverado models and 16 503 Sierra models.
The shares in the New York storm increased by 1.4 per cent on Friday to 37.47 USD.
A trusted shout of Obama's volleyball
I loved both of them twice — I shared my hope of a possible change
He says Obama's honest efforts have led to obstacles by the Republican party
Obstructive policy cannot excuse the loss of Obama’s health care website or the attacks of pilot-free aircraft
Obama's 2008 campaign memories are a sad reminder of what could happen
Nathaniel P. Morris is studying medicine at Harvard in the second year.
I read a very sad book these days.
I thought about this book that during the dark days of my second year at the medical school, it would wake me up and give me hope.
It is called “The Audacity to Win” and is a reminder of Barack Obama’s presidential campaign in 2008.
When I finish the patient exams tonight and I go to bed, the book will bring me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people and the events took your breath.
The volleyballs ended with a heavy traffic and television news we had to think about the historical value of this moment.
My colleagues cried out with joy, and my parents hid the papers they had gathered.
In the White House, a young team of visionaries was directed, and the nation was prepared to change.
Obama had 82 per cent support during the submission to the Authority in 2008.
And I'm closing the book here.
To go to the present is a tough blow, like to get out of the dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic days – they seem to be distant memories, sad memories of missed opportunities.
In the years since I entered my first wish list, it really has come to change.
It was definitely nothing of what I imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied successes – from the law on the availability of care through the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the policy “do not ask, say nothing” after the death of Usami bin Ládin.
In addition, I am convinced that the foreign restrictions have made so much effort to put our nation forward: it is, among others, an immigration reform, the opportunity for the public to choose health care and to close the foundation in Guantánamo.
But after many situations, when I defended Obama's administration before my colleagues and friends, I, when it comes to explanation that they can provide, have reached an absolute limit.
I felt political despair in the place.
The obstacles of the Republicans cannot explain the agreement with foreign leaders or with pilot-free planes who kill innocent children in the sea.
They cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on American private lives, nor that it monitors those who detect wrong government behavior.
They cannot be held responsible for the correction of Anwar al-Awlakí, an American citizen, without a proper court or for limiting public contributions and expenditure during the presidential campaigns.
They can't justify finding a message that says that the efforts of the White House to shut down the media are “more aggressive... than Nixon's administratives”.
And the latest can not even apologize for the inability to create more than 3 years after signing the law on access to the simple website.
I don't know if something like that happened.
Did I have to guess at the age of 18 that the government power could be in conflict with the political campaigns that led to her?
Volena function obviously has no predictive course and our public talks will create an opposition political party and the fate of events like a massacre in Newton.
However, all the examples I have mentioned above seem to be the result of the administrative decision itself.
And that hurts me the most.
I fell in love with both of them again in 2012, but not because I was raised by his candidate.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and undisputed alternative and seemed unable to reconcile his policy or position.
I felt that the second functional period for Obama, free from the pressure of the next elections, the full hope we've ever heard of.
However, it is to return to 2008 – with the support of both of them under 45% this week – through this book, which continues to be more difficult.
He's trying to remind me of this series of promises that have been lost.
This week, I read in the book a chapter about how Obama endured a wooden strike with Clinton in Pennsylvania in the spring.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back to the clock and remain faithful to his mission.
"I want our shirt back," he said.
We can't forget who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I'm just agreeing with you.
The opinions expressed in this comment are extremely opinions of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Tony Abbott's president is in charge of interests due to the parental permission programme.
A billionaire and Ambassador Clive Palmer says the president of the government, Tony Abbott, is in charge of the interests of the parental programme, because his daughters can get tired and tired of it.
The Banese magnet, which is opposed to the reward of the oil tax rate at $6 million, brought this claim when he tried to get out of the table, whether he was in the interest field.
The United States Party may hold up to four votes in the Senate to play a key role in deciding whether to choose from coal and steel taxes.
But Mr. Palmer said that only ministers could be interested in the matter, and he added that Abbott's daughters were in a position when they could have personal advantage from that policy.
"It has come to a great deal of interest, if it is a paid parent's permit, because if any of his daughter is ill, he should be directly interested in getting a parent's permit," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the vote, the election committee officially announced Mr Palmer's victory over the Fairfax Cross in the Sunshine Coast, thanks to 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of voluntary results to speed up the process.
Dcery Tonyho Abbotta Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the elections?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, get details to the computer, vote immediately and have results in half the seventh night?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of the petition to mark the votes.
Is it that the results can be lost if someone doesn't like them?
In these days and at this time, the use of tobacco seems unbelievable.
The voluntary committee studied the possibility of electronic vote and recently issued a joint contribution to the debate with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer (59) said that his political programme was also relevant to the Sunshine Coast airport and that his new work would be "very serious".
The public office is the public service.
"We are not demanding any reward except that we can serve companies in this critical time," he said.
Do you have your hands?
The scientists have come to see that they're cheating on your hands.
The experiment was attended by 98 persons divided into three groups.
The first two were to resolve the insoluble role.
Of course they didn't.
But the group that did wash their hands after a while made a lot more optimistic than the one where her participants did not wash their hands.
Also, the group "with your fingers" was doing better in another test than the other one.
Still, those who wash their hands have more results in other tests than those who have not washed their hands.
The results of the "loss" were at the level of the third group, with no previous successes recorded by the participants.
The results of the test indicate by psychologists that physical purity removes really negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, complex motivations, testing needs to focus much more on other trials.
If we were to transfer the results of the research to Czechs, we would probably be the most optimistic after the WC's return.
After using WC, only one percent of Czech and Czech people do not have their hands, but on the road to city transport it is five.
For hygiene, most also after work in the garden or in the district, when 85 percent of the people wash their hands.
A home machete is caused by 78.7 percent of people.
A recent study revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, so it is necessary to wash your hands after handing them to a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 per cent of Czechs and 40.3 per cent of Slovaks wash their hands.
The study showed that both nations had their hands dirty ten times a day.
"Even if it were on the spot, I'm afraid the reality is different and people are trying to do so a little better," commented Dr. Claudia Komárk.
RBS suspends two foreign traders
According to two persons concerned, the situation is suspended by the Scottish Royal Bank (RBS) by two traders in its division with a foreign currency, which is another indication that the global investigation by the control authorities on suspicious machine machines with the exchange market is increasingly common.
Some of the world's largest banks, including the U.S., Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with the competent authorities to investigate the world's largest financial market, where the currency exchanges USD 5.3 billion each day.
The reference of two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the scope of an extensive investigation, which is the response to the LIBOR manipulating schedule (London Interbank rate measure).
The Bank refused to comment, but confirmed that this month received a request from the authorities for information.
"Our ongoing engagement in this matter continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and our other bodies," the bank announced two weeks ago.
Last month, the people who are close to this event indicated that RBS transmitted e-mail and instant messages to the British financial authority and to the accounts of the former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is expected to have been released from his current position by the European trade president with a foreign trader at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European President of the Citi cash trade, came this week, while Matt Gardiner, former trade leader in Barclays and U.S., was suspended this week by the Standard Chartered Company.
Not one of these traders was accused of any crime.
The bankers from Barclays and Citigroup joined Mr. Usher's team to send a quick message, and the people said they were committed to this event.
This week the Bank stated that after the Swiss Authority announced that it had investigated suspected foreign exchange machines in several Swiss banks, it had taken steps against some of its employees.
Globally, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finland, the Swiss Anti-Monopol Authority Weko, the FCA, the Ministry of Justice in the United States and the Mining Authority in Hong Kong – are investigating the claim that these banks have mixed up to move with the exchange market.
The complainants claimed that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse had also submitted an internal investigation or a request from the relevant authorities.
Banks spend years reading old news and e-mails to find cases of fraud.
The investigation reports frightened traders in the area, which was one of the largest engines for the creation of profits in investment banks in recent years, but which was disturbed by the fact that the small absence of me missed the opportunity for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation by claiming that it is essentially impossible to manipulate with a wide and high liquidity market with a foreign currency, but the high standards of traders say that this must not necessarily be true.
A high-ranking trader said that despite the significant volume of day-to-day trade with a foreign exchange of liquidity testing between various trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own domestic platforms, "you can start to influence the market at relatively low prices."
The report came on that day when credit Suisse announced that it had left its trade department this week, which had caused the loss of almost $6 million by the end of last year.
The Bank shall immediately notify the competent authorities and cooperate with their supervisory authorities.
"We are convinced that this trader has dealt with himself and that this problem has been solved," said the Credit Suisse Society.
The number of HIV infected in Prague has moved thousands
Doctors in Prague have already shown more than a thousand people with HIV virus.
From the beginning of the 1986 survey to the end of the third quarter of the year, the test confirmed the prohibition of 1005 persons from the metropolis.
This is based on the statistics of the national reference laboratory for the AIDS state health institution.
According to it, there were 2,063 registered in the entire PRC.
The 396 immune disease has already collapsed.
198 people died.
The number of persons registered in Czech Republic in the last decade is growing annually.
In 2002, the tests confirmed infection in 50 people, 121 years later.
In 2009, the investigation removed 156 new orders and then 180 in 2010.
The previous number fell to 153, but the last one was a record.
According to the lab, they were 212.
"On the fact that the total number of new diagnosed cases this year will exceed 200, which I think is no mistake," said the expert on the AIDS Miroslav Hlav Hlav, who spent the summer with the Prague House of Light for Patients.
From October to the end of 2011 the tests revealed a ban on 39 people and last year 47, said Hlavatý.
In the doctor’s session, 21 new patients and three patients were identified.
From the start of monitoring to the end of the HIV test, 1710 men and 353 women were confirmed.
The AIDS disease spread to 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
Anyone who really wants to know some town should be on the graveyard.
His visit reveals more than a visit to the centre started with memories, churches and galleries, more than he would have invented.
A lot of people read from the graves.
Slowly, they slow down the roots and gain a close look at local reality.
They find out what people here live here, what nations they believe, how great and enduring families belong, how old they die, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions have been to them.
How they express their social status as they experience it.
And from the state of the graves, they will find out how they care about their dead.
The Supreme Court upheld Obama's Health Care Act
The Supreme Court in the United States decided that the Health Care Act signed by Barack Obama is in accordance with the Constitution, which is the basic victory for Obama's administration.
By means of vote 5:4, the Court decided that the individual regulation on the protection of patients and the care available to citizens, which provides for the purchase of health insurance by 2014, or it would threaten to pay the fine, does not oppose the Constitution on the basis of government tax.
The President of the Court of Justice, John Roberts, stood on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while the judges of Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The Court also supported the remaining parts of the 2700-page law and further decided that the legal requirement for health care, which states intend to extend the possibility of obtaining non-industrial insurance, would, in a negative case, jeopardise all the financing of non-industrial insurance from federal sources, is not taxable and in dispute with the constitution.
The application was lodged by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises for the purpose of blocking this law.
During the spring of 2012, the law strongly rejected each of the main Republican candidates, including the proposed candidate Mitta Romney.
The word "Mugabe is a cold island" is no longer dangerous to prison, the court broke the law
To date, Zimbabwens have had to pay close attention to how they speak to the public about the nine-year-old Mugabe, who has been ruling the country since the early 1980s, and then to the end of 1987.
Pursuant to paragraph 33 of the criminal law, the failure of the Presidential Authority to comply with the provisions of the President's Act has threatened an amount of $100 up to one year of deprivation of liberty.
"The representatives of the State should not be critical of people who comment on the president in the economy or in other public places," said the representatives of the Constitutional Court.
The nine judges agreed unanimously that the law covers freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government has appealed against the decision of the court, informed the British BBC.
In contrast to the law, a number of Zimbabwean wounded, including Tendai Dang, who was arrested by the police two years ago by the president in charge of the bar.
In May he ended up in prison for opposition activists who attended the public of Mugabe's "Culva Island".
In August, the prosecutor accused a six-year-old man of his intention to use the poster with Robert Mugabe's face as a toilet paper.
The Court also ruled against the law restricting freedom of the media.
"The state can't count on people whose declaration later appears to be unfair," said Deputy Minister of Justice Luke Malala.
So far the Zimbabwean law has allowed a person who is publicly informed of false information to be sentenced to twenty years of imprisonment.
"The existence of a law allowing a person to criminalize for unjust declaration has a disgusting effect on the right to freedom of expression," Malala added.
Despite the fact that Mugabe's government has been holding hands for more than 33 years, a new constitution with wider civil freedoms was adopted in March in Zimbabwe on the basis of the referendum.
The narrow crossings from the dictatorship of one man occurred in 2009, when the agreement between Mugabe and opposition led to the prime line of Morgan Tswanger.
However, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and until 2008 the world's highest inflation, which exceeded 100,000 per cent.
In 2009, the government therefore completely abolished the national currency.
Today, Zimbabwe is only paid for by other countries.
The proposed economy is headed for Mugabe's irrevocable agricultural reform.
In 2000, he divided the land of white farmers between his rivals and the war veterans.
Most of them, however, did not have any experience.
Central banks will keep swap lines steady
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the American Federation, the Bank of England and the Central Banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument allowing banks to access global changes whenever they need it.
The banks indicated this in their joint statement.
"It's a very reasonable step," commented Julian Callow, the leading international economy of the London Bank of Barclays.
"Now all the transmissible tools of this type have gradually become permanent, so it is not in my surprise," adds the Military Bend, the main BH Security economy.
Central bankers are strengthening the gap that started to develop in 2007, when the international credit market first closed.
The central banks' agreements allowed access to euro, dollars and other changes to anyone who needed them.
The decision of the central bankers is coming at a time when the American Federation is preparing to complete its US economic support programme, which could raise the price of money on the global market even higher.
The liability contract shall be used by default to overcome the lack of liquidity one change in the current transition of liquidity another change.
It can be understood as a contribution to one change and a loan to another change.
The ECB shall initiate a third attempt to return trust to the European Bank.
The EU has agreed to a bank survey, the ECB will look at 150 banks.
How Tipsport (no) does personal data.
More than a year ago, I made a registration on the Tipsport.cz pages.
But I didn't end up here, because on the side there was someone who couldn't finish the internet registration.
And because I didn't want to go to the other side, I lost my registration, so I moved, and as a result, I changed my address and the number of citizens.
When I wanted to finish the registration later, I was told that it won't happen because I have another OP number and that it's just not going to finish and that I have to ask for the data exchange and make a new registration.
So I did that and on 24.10.2013 I wrote on technical support that I would ask for the payment of all my personal data from the database under the payment of personal data protection law.
On that spiritual day, she wrote me technical support that I had to finish the registration on my desk.
This started with the e-mail maraton on technical support, where at the end of the fourth quarter, they wrote that personal data were missing at my request.
The person would then say that he could do that new registration and here the problems began again before I wrote that my username is already contained (the understand was not deleted - not one about personal data, but one of these was set up).
So I used another username and jumped over to me that my personal data have already been stored to complete the registration on the side (how can they have something that they have already removed?), so I contacted again with technical support.
On my question, how could I be denied that my personal data really cost 25.10 and send an e-mail with that error.
I did this (about 15 p.m. yesterday) and I was registered today (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that it will not be done because I used the same name and date of birth.
As for technical support, I've been in touch with them for a week and I'm still not going to do it.
And what if the truth is what it claims (as it is not) could not be registered by any of the same name or date of birth if it has already been registered.
Only by the exception of the 13.22s I actually registered, on the same name and date of birth, but I used the thought email and phone number and the world of weirdness, it turned out to me that the website sent me an e-mail address to finish the registration.
But how is it possible if you cannot register on the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport weighs the registration on the e-mail and phone number and the data just doesn't tell how he claims.
So again, I've given this technical support that they're just lying (whether mentally or not they know what it says) because what it says is not true.
I have pointed out several screens that the registration problem was still before 31.10. So "false" registration has no effect on this one.
I'm sorry, but since you're already registered, we can't verify your claim.
And communication's over.
The respective shall repeat to the same extent that the registration is based on the name and date of birth.
They can't even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on the email address and did not actually go through.
If that's what I'm going to do, Tipsport's not just that he didn't get the data he claims, but he's still lying when he says it's wrong.
It's worse that you can easily prove how they're lying and trying to make it look like there's a mistake on the customer's side.
Despite this concern on my personal blog, things were a little moving and e-mail from the Technical Support came to the attention of the Commission to check and be informed (after a week of emergency, receipt and warning on the same error).
In the meter on the bridge plays music
Transport company hl. m. (DPP) Prague has submitted a project of music in meters.
The first building, where during the operation of the meter, the reproducated instrument music is the Museum of Line A at the exit of the Václav village.
Experimental operation takes six months.
Michal Horaček presented his new two albums, hat and three songs
Textary Michal Horaček brought to the Hall of the Colinian City Company not only his completely new twoCDs Czech calendar, but above all, among us songs of Lenku New, Františka Segrad and Ondru Rumla by the excellent Orchestrem Mateje Benka.
After the opening intru and the erection of the late musician Michal Horáček gradually invited all three songs to the floor, he came up with a candle in his hand and reminded him of the story of how the last plays in Kolina and in the theater and in the entire city.
"They also produced two types of cards in Colin, with which I came in contact a lot," he recalled.
He also reminded the parents of the President of the Earth.
"Maybe we could make a tour by the Zakolans or the Dubras in Bratislavy," he tweeted about the parents of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horaček, who did not leave the hall and, if he did not speak, sat in the chair with a glass of wine, touched his new music.
The calendar also made Josef Mānes, who gave it on an eagle, about the ice hockey, but he didn't know how we're meeting in these places, and we're wondering who's not in Czech.
So it's also called one song from the Czech calendar, but we're not playing here today," he said.
Ondra Ruml, however, sings for him from this disk before a very suitable spat in the day, sings after night, and walks with her on the guitar.
Or if he didn't sing, he was playing percussion, all three songs, then he made a cap in keyboard composition, violonello, guitar and contraband.
All three vocalists together sang a little of the drummer To the side of the seat, which immediately scattered the scene.
"I'm glad that the song caught you, which didn't surprise me in the city of Kmocho," replied Michael Horáček after that.
After referring to Petra Hapku, I agreed with Varzává in giving Františka Segrada, originally awarded by Richard Müller in a huge appeal, Hana Hegerov also recalled that Dad loved Lied Baaro and with the Horačk's explanation of the communist order and the reward of the Baroque American hero Mae West.
The composer Michael Kocába also reminded Sebastian of the composition, then Segrado sings the beautiful collection of Praha, decorated by Jardo Freebodo, a lonely parent, and an ex-Colinica.
But it's already been the end, the collapse in the state and the contribution in the form of the optimistic funds we live in a wonderful time.
One more contribution was made to the playlist, but the fans were no longer involved.
Almost immediately after the concert, the entire quarter sat behind the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček his books and even the apple from the legendary LP and with the interested people he took photos.
Berdycha with Stépánke adds Rosol and Hajek
On the final of Davis' campaign against Serbia, he appointed the non-playing captain of Czech tennisists Jaroslav Returns four Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hajek.
The honest representatives of the trophies are complaining, but they are going to play on the hill against the Belgrade arena, where the game is carried out on the hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
In the finals, the Czechs have been under siege for the last five years.
"We know we're going on hot ground that it's going to be wild and we have to focus as always on our performance."
"We'll go there with the only goal - to get three points and sell them the best," said Štépanek, the winner of the winning point in the London final with Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama, how to bomb Syria.
U.S. Army in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelites had just predicted how the Syrian bombing would appear.
Without excessive noise, threat, and millions of declarations, they sent out planes, set targets, and returned.
Until they are allowed to engage in official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
All the actions refuse to be confirmed and are no longer exposed to it.
The exact opposite is confused and enormous, acts not supported by Obama's Syrian policy.
And the most reassuring thing about the whole attack was what the Israelites were doing.
Don't be fooled by their claims that there was a "syrian base" or "supplies for Hizbalah".
I recently wrote here about the fact that while helping US secular rebels in the country remains only on a rhetorical level, Russia continues to deliver Syrian weapons.
And just a clean supply of Russian rockets in the port of Latvia became the target of an Israeli invasion.
A clear message.
And remember, Israel again bombed Asad's regime, no matter how far it should be, according to popular Internet theories.
The U.S. government has appointed 2 members of the space units, probably Delta Force.
It wasn't quiet until now that they were registered during an attack on the American consulate in Benghazi.
It is known that the Croatian death of two former SEALs officers who had invaded the CIA area in the city, I believe, was about the members of the CIA secret team, which was created by former soldiers.
It has long been speculated about what SEALs did to the consulate or even to other CIA residents.
Now it's clearer.
In any event, the information that the CIA has its official protected by greenhouse gases in Libya (just one of the two members of the SEALs have disappeared after the fall) is quite surprising.
But it's even more surprising to know about those two unknown brains.
They were members of the U.S. Command in Tripoli, and once they received reports of an attack in Bengazi, they volunteered to join the crew and, together with five private contractors, shot the CIA area in Benghazi.
The administration of both of them condemns the fact that during that attack, that command was not officially established, and that it was simply a matter of what to do.
The commander of the team will obviously release these volunteers without orders.
In any case, the fact that the country does not operate on a single-time basis, but remains the American team, the CIA agents and private contractors are very interested in information.
And this is because until recently there has been no official recognition of anything like this, and it's only now talking about some NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it's good that the United States is still trying to eradicate terrorism in Libya.
Even if it would help a lot more to solve the global situation.
The last place of the secret and permanent conflict that I want to write today is the border of Iran.
It's not as long as the media have almost played Iranian air forces to attract American drones.
Little do we know, however, how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if they can reveal their drones in the air, they won't do anything about it.
However, if the Iranian drone appears in the international space, the situation is quite different.
And so it happened that Iran's F-4 Phantom was tracking American drones in the international area over the sea when it was possible to get to the first extreme of the discovery of the American super power F-22 Raptor in history.
He flew over Phantom to optically check his weapon without having him registered on the radar or just looked at it, and when he suddenly appeared in it and called the Iranian pilot back home, he listened without question.
It's no wonder that Phantom is a year old American product that remembers the war in Vietnam.
Raptor can't compare.
We want to show that the Flood is still able to win, promises the Rajtoral.
It's such a little paradox.
While his team in particular will not be able to produce results in recent years, the defense or the deputy of Victoria Plzeň František Rajtoral has a form that has brought him back to representation after one year.
He's got shots, he's playing, and after a while he's been shot in Teplice.
Victoria saw in the last two streets against Slav and Teplice after victory, but finally she took the only point from these two dules.
František Rajtoral believes his team is breaking down with Jablonce an unacceptable series of crimes.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe that Jablonec will be destroyed at home," promises František Rajtoral.
The men on the heavy game with the Severochs who play the attack football are well prepared.
It's all going to run with Jablonce, the trainer prepares us well, as we're always cutting a lot out of the video game competition.
"I believe it will be a great party on Friday evening," said the Czech representative of the fiction at the Doosan Arena Court.
The last games didn't go as far as she wanted, but Victoria's word of the crisis is rejected.
So it's going in the photoball, sometimes you have a good shape and sometimes worse.
But I wouldn't have talked about the crisis in any way.
"I believe we win Friday, and it'll be fine again," said the Westerners' defense.
Victoria's husband will again rely on the support of the fans.
"It's playing on Friday night, and that's why I'd like to invite our great fans."
"I believe we will thank them for their victory," adds the Rajtoral.
Jana Five: Step back.
So I decided to step back, but when I think about it, it's not really about the step, it's about the big jump -- the jump of a few years back, and that's what I remember about my childhood.
It's a reminder of what it was like to have no care and just get out of school and get rid of supplies, get out and do your jobs.
Even though these "debts," it was mostly just theory, parenting.
Praxe was completely different - to get out of school, throw a bag into the kitchen and run out.
Play games with other kids toy games, jump pancakes.
Then, at Helena's series and her boys, they're going to blow up the Christmas Eve for the grandmother to the birthday.
And then, after a few warnings, you can finally get this supply, get out, put a tree in the cold, and do the tasks until you sit under the lamp (or rely on the staff and instead of the tasks of writing a favorite letter of school love).
Early in the morning, you will have a home ice cream (from the real fruit, not the vegetables that are sold now, their ingredients are not available by ice) and ask them for a tea from the dried ingredients that we had so enjoyed with my mother.
I also remember those cool evenings when there was a grave silence in the bedroom when we played songs from the radio to the newspapers, which were played aloud in the old tape recorder after my mother.
And then we turned to the prosecutions and left the same song, our favorite song, and we joined the symphony.
Or we called on the table by means of the pillows that were tied to each other by the train, and when we were on the phone, to hear better, it was necessary to clean the ears on the ground, the next guest was a cheese + wata.
The minimum maybe was more than three times lower than she is now, and my parents were able to live with her so we didn't miss anything.
We didn't need any of those iPhones, iPadys or even mobile phones and notebooks or branding.
Clothing was inherited from generation to generation and the best "adhesive" into the tent was a bit of domestic products using SAVA.
From the electronics, we were able to find comfort from the mentioned mother of the waitress, and to the extent that Walkman, whom we shared with our sister, and which we used outside, was just on the train on a school trip.
We've come to play more interestingly with Aunt Cloboučka Hop or Man, don't get hurt, or as I've already indicated to go "only" outside.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, and his parents would have been looking for him for a long time, but he didn't burn in us for a long time.
My younger sister threw a bullet in him before he shot those newspapers so beautiful that she tried if he shot and shot.
I'm sorry he's asleep, but it was his last sentence.
Well, and this event has a lot to do, poor, on your dad's talars all the time.
She says that when Lenka was a kid, she threw a bullet in the video and thought she was playing a recipe and didn't play it, so she couldn't do it today.
I remember how we were able to communicate, talk without a cell phone, computer.
Together with my sister, we agreed on holidays in Grandma's grandmother's house when we met again the next year at Grandma's house - and so it was, so it paid.
We're together.
Do you have a date with someone to see you in a year?
I also remember the winter when we ran out of the village with snowflakes, walked on a snowcapped corner of the church on the sandy beaches.
Then we grew up together with the whole family and talked about the last day.
Of course, we listened to the sister every evening, notorically, to the voice, "Don't touch your hands!"
Yes, it's paid today, but you probably don't have a bathroom in the bathroom to bring a pot of lemons into the net.
After dinner, when Dad in the garage "worked" in a beer with Jardo from the village, we slept with his mom on the floor, broke his legs on the rocks, opened the door and looked at the flame and listened to the wood-breaking from the stone line.
We were close - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on social networks, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated with each other - we talked - we didn't write messages every day through a variety of chats, SMS.
There was nothing like that, but we knew more about ourselves.
And that's how I could go on for a long time.
It's nice to remember, especially if I add these memories by looking at the album, where the black lines are, in view of the chosen black photos.
And if I don't know how hard it was for me, the picture's always written year of recording.
I see that even though our sisters didn't listen very much to us by the side, and we also had our pants after the brother had two larger numbers, no one ever laughed at us before, it was so normal (no I.N.).
And I'd rather be back on that step before it's real.
By 2013, I'll wait for what modern times mean for my children once.
What I do know is that these memories of me are now for young adults so at least in some "one hundred years after the oysters" and I think they're going to come up with a lot of things that they don't have this "precipice" time.
I'd love to!
Google, Samsung and Huawei companies complained about the patents of Nortel
The group, which owns thousands of patents missing from Nortel's company, filed on Thursday a complaint against producers of mobile phones, including Google's company, a company that was excavated in the course of the sale of Nortel's banknote.
The Rockstar Consortium, which won Nortel's $4.5 billion patents, complained at the U.S. court in Texas of Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringements.
The Rockstar company is owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of breaking seven patents.
The patents include technologies that help to link online search terms with the relevant advertising, which is the core of Google's search company.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately arriving.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce phones operating on the Google Android operating system, which strongly competes with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011 Google made the patent company Nortel out of the price offer of $900 million.
Google has raised its bid several times and finally offered up to $4.4 billion.
After he was defeated in the fight against patent Nortel against the company Rockstar, Google gained $12.5 billion of Motorola Mobility company, which was a business motivated by a partial group of patents of Motorola companies.
"Despite the failure of efforts to win a patent, which is the subject of a dispute, the Google patent company has failed and continues to fail," the complaint states.
The Rockstar company insists on an increase in compensation for damages from Google's company, as it claims to be a loss of patent from Google mentally, as the complaint claims.
Miloslava Cjepkova: November smile
She came out of 4 degrees Celsia, which we're not used to.
First, she gave up smiles, the one who kept giving her a gun as a defense against a friendly environment.
That's because it was a mask that she decided not to disclose to the public.
He was honest at home only in the days when his grandmother was pregnant with Elin or Adík around him.
And of course, when her sons called her.
Very well remembered the lesson from the endless courses of business skills.
Now they're finally really gone.
So she won't get her closest.
Then he flew into the kitchen.
It's like a shift to a mask.
In November, not even another month will be able to perform this miracle to make it true, as if they were on a trip with someone who hasn't been here for nearly three years.
Egypt refers to the office of the first freely elected President
Muhammad Mursi made an inaugural vow, but his triumphal day is only hard to end the political turmoil in Egypt.
ISLAMISTA Muhammad Mursi promised “new Egypt” when he was brought to the office as the first freely elected president of this country, after Husni Mubarak, who was sitting 16 months earlier.
When he was brought before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic President in the Arab world and the fifth head of Egypt since the monarchy was brought to trial about 60 years ago.
He made an oath before 18 judges brought to the black talent in a chair built with a view to the Nile, which reminds the ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are strengthening for the better tomorrow, the new Egypt and the other Republic," Mursi said in a celebration of life on state television.
"The Egyptian people today have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said Mursi, a sixteen-year-old engineer who studied in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group who was 84 years after its appearance as an illegal organization in the face of the terrible attacks of individual governments.
When Murzy arrived shortly after 11 o'clock in a small car colony, hundreds of soldiers and police were stationed.
Only a few supporters came before the building court to celebrate the president, and transport was only delayed in the Mubarak period, in contrast to the presidential demonstration, so that the colony could normally design a Russian road link to the city centre in the south.
Mursey's personal prestige, falsely marked as a non-characteristic "reservative pneumatic" of the Muslim fraternity, grew early from his victory and his pagan manifestation, which was intended to present him not only as a candidate for Islam, but also to all who want to bring an end to opposition to the authorate Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Mursi, quoted in a blue social dress with red cow judges in a wooden room where he made a promise.
Murzy later traveled to Kahir University, where he had to deliver inaugural presentations.
While he was in sight, he was officially welcomed by the military captain who played the national anthem.
Pritoman was the military commander of the full Marshal Hussein Tantava.
His arrival was carried out by the scant “arms and people are one hand” of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as the center of secular education and later in the 1970s became the home of Islamic students.
Mursi made a symbolic oath in the fifth place of Tahrír, in the place where the revolution was brought to an end by the authoritarian government of Mubarak, and promised to recapture the presidential power conferred by his office by the military council, which took it from the exodus leader.
But I agree with the formal pledges before the court, rather than before Parliament as usual, to appeal to the will of the army, which means that the fight will continue too much.
Mursi's appearance at Tahrír's place was full of dramatic populist gestures.
They'll probably be police specialists, they'll have to calm down.
In the gates of Czech Republic, police specialists should be trained in the future.
They'd be here till half of their tracks.
They'd look at the order and solve the problems.
As a result of their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tension between people from poor places and the people around them.
In its proposal to reduce safety risks, the Ministry of the Interior shall count.
According to him, improving the situation in the country would help mainly "sustained social housing".
The document was handed over to the government.
According to the analysis, there were about 300 homes and a quarter of homes in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
He lived in them for 80,000 people, mostly Roma.
Adults in ghettos were unemployed, families were dependent on doses, children ended up in "special" schools.
We're moving.
According to experts in problem locations, there has been a percentage difference.
The relationships between their citizens and others are strained.
In a few places, anti-terrorist exits occurred.
The extremists also joined the people around.
Under the inside, the police are responsible for maintaining safety and order in the areas of ghetto.
The basic condition is before "continued application of equal access to the rule of law".
But it's not possible for people to reach it without detailed knowledge of the places and people.
A specialist would go on trips to the ghetto, where he would spend up to half of his services, and the rest would serve in his career.
He'd look at the order in the problem area.
He would also know the locals, so he could solve better problems or obstacles.
"Thanks to this trust, specialists will be able to proceed with the whole range of counter-terrorism," said inside.
Specialists in ghettics would get payments, which is 500 to 1000 kroner per month.
The introduction of special police officers to the problem areas should be funded from the Norwegian funds.
The start is about 600,000 euros (now a total of 15.5 million kroner).
Czech pays 15 per cent of the sum, 85 per cent of the funds.
The preparations began this year, a detailed proposal is being drawn up.
The project will last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully implemented for several years in Slovenia, where the problem with socially excluded localities is not even higher than in the PRC.
"There are so-called Roman states here," the authors of the news said.
How many specialists should be in Czech, it's not clear yet.
The answer has to be given by an analysis which sets out places where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also be concerned how much money will be spent on these officials by the police after the project is completed each year.
According to the project proposal, the police are taking a stand in Slovenia before the first election.
Each year, this training should be conducted by five tenths of staff.
They'll get the most suitable candidates.
There should also be special education for police officers who will be in trouble.
According to the authors, improving the situation would help to improve the social situation.
It should be motivated and brought to integration first.
According to the presentation within, there should be three categories.
The minimum standard would be met with precise rules, such as the number of persons in the room.
The average standard would be in smaller apartments.
Higher standards would have social housing that would be comparable to normal housing.
The employers would have to fill in an integrated plan, which would be made up of social workers.
They should maintain a living order, take care of their health, send the children to school, revalidize, and actively seek employment.
If they'd tried to get involved, they'd come to a higher standard of living.
The step-by-step housing system should operate within at least 30 years until the next generation "in the prointegrated environment" is grown.
Social housing model prepares resources for local development and work.
They've been planning it for the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: Uhller's top - one of our youngest shoes.
The peak is an ideal peak of 3 km south of Bruntal.
Together with a number of others, the evidence of cooperative activities in the Netherlands is recent (from a geologic perspective).
The last Europeans here were still at the beginning of the fourth.
In view of the greater distance, at the top of the Ullers' summit is the ideal white, surrounded by the Baroque Adventist Church of Ms. Marie Auxicné, held in 1755 - 1765.
He won the original wooden strip.
The guest who stood next to the church didn't keep it.
Shortly after the end of the church, an ale was excavated from four lines of lip, about 1 km long.
The cross road on the Ulliřska mountain is already the third version, the original standing here after 1916, the second, from 2001 to 2004.
On the fifteenth of the stops are wooden plastics that have produced the local art designer František Nedomlel.
He used various types of wood from the Netherlands.
Similarly, the origin of the horn from the higher part of the area creates an interesting geologic exposure.
The name of the sponsor is also given on each stop.
The carbon peak is the rest of the young soybeans.
Although the data from the radiometric measurements is somewhat different, the last europex was here about 1.5 million years ago.
He is then younger than the Great Red (old 3.3 million years) and older than the Venusina soupka (old 0.8 million years).
Soupka was born in an explosion.
It has produced a significant amount of cod with the portion of the horn from the ground which has produced a redished color by burning.
At the end of this phase, it has flown on the surface of the flesh - today it is the type of a straight line up to 13 meters strong.
The second european has produced red, brown, and places to black tubes.
Their species are strong up to 50 meters and part of it is available in the wall.
In tufts there are captivating ducts up to 1 m. And the second epsums were finished with the relief of the flesh.
At the end of the operation, the meat, which makes up to 50 m of a strong kind of swirl.
Soaps in which the seedling of the seed of the seed with the leaves of the flesh is the most common type of soup.
Because they're actually composed of species, they got the name stratovolcane.
The original seismic skin was gradually exposed to erosion.
However, he was threatened by a heavy horn on the south side.
The most intense difficulty here was in the years 1953 - 1962.
The tubes were added to the concrete, which was then easier and had better heat-insulation properties.
The service was carried out under the pressure of experts and the public to stop and to maintain this unique place.
The problem is, however, in the prosperity and the small consistency of the horn, which quickly breathes, disintegrates and accumulates after the fall.
The damage goes so fast.
To make the situation even more complicated, it is warm, south-centrally oriented with its ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The adjustment is therefore challenging, but it will take time to select and maintain a characteristic geologic profile.
It's nothing new, similar profiles remain on a number of important sites.
On the Ullerski summit you will get a green tourist brand from Bruntal, possibly from Slezska Kočov.
Automotives can use the unpaid parking lot at the beginning of the climber, where a short course of learning begins.
She moved from the villa to the panel.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in the Chinese villa with a garden and pool in one of the most beautiful Persian villas in Orechovce.
The original owners of the house also obtained her back in the restaurant and the tenants had to move with a small distance away.
That's why Ivan quickly sought revenge for himself and his older mother at the time.
From the famous, he got a tip for the apartment 3 + kk in the old panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor to the large forest park and the prize lifted me up on the other side," recalls Ivana at the first floor.
First I said it's going to be a provisional for three years.
"We live here today for more than thirty years and not only because of progressive reconstruction," the owner adds.
Mother and daughter then moved from one hundredth of an apartment to a smaller area of 62 m2 and distributed all the equipment.
The action was not easy, things were agreed with the friend, and a progressive arrangement lasted almost a year.
The new apartment was in a very good condition, but it had to undergo necessary repairs, such as opening the door or changing the window.
The former owner has created a core, but the owner has the most ineffective solution and a very large one, but a small bathroom.
By connecting two rooms, it created a multifunctional living space.
The architects used to decompose the individual areas and members of the sardrokarton room, which allowed a new location of light.
The first marriage, which took place a few years later, was the removal of the tree into the living room.
The apartment has changed the availability of 2 + kkk, but the room has reached air and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding green.
Another step towards partial improvement of the standard was the refund of VAT for laminate.
Ivana and the bathroom didn't know the advice.
For years, I've collected housing magazines and I've been looking for inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting realization.
I then praised young architect Kamil Douder.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," Ivana says.
As a result of the construction of the bathroom, the repair was also made available to the president.
The architect connects the toilet and the bathroom and the two doors with open windows were replaced by one of the doors that saved the place.
The bathroom is over-time and also sufficiently free of charge.
The quality equipment imitates the sandbag, in the spring it is also a comfortable seat, in the closet of the bidet.
Successful cooperation with Kamilo Douder continued.
Under the order of how the dream was to take place quickly, but the fundamental change in the living room was shared by architect Martin Čeněk.
We had to get three functions, food, habitat and space into the space that resulted in the connection of two smaller rooms, without helping with the classic principles of the optical division, such as semi-trailers or Japanese walls.
"This would result in a lack of openness and unity of space," explains the architect.
It was originally possible to divide the room and the living part.
It was enough to turn the back of two straps and put between them a pier-made box.
The food bag is separated by remote floor and flooring.
On the floor of the kitchen and the dining room, the architect used quality marble, which opened the door to revive wallpaper with a pattern.
When necessary, the kitchen counter will cover the empty panels with a wallpaper.
The new floor of the anti-allergic marble has the previous dimensions of the laminate of a series of benefits: a soft non-clutter surface without a spaghetti and a better sound isolation.
The benefit system and views of sardrocarton highlighted color are an indication of how you can work with space in the panel.
I left colors on the architects, I wanted it to be happy.
"I like Orange, I had the same distance in the past room," says Ivana.
The surface of the graphite with the motive of bright magnesium is practical and creates an excellent aesthetic element.
At the hot energy tone, architects chose white, which was underpinned by modern functional style.
In a small apartment, you were able to place books outside of the room under a parapet.
It's all about reach, lamps are comfortablely controlled far.
In the converted interior, it works well in contrast with the older ones, such as the 10-year-old Christian luxury and the quality artistic objects that Ivana collects all her life.
The last one on the line came to the kitchen.
The windows were previously placed on both sides, and the owner seemed a little like a tunnel.
The architect picked up their numbers and crossed the space.
The furniture in a simple design is made on the ban, the white area gently softens the surface of the plane.
The small area was covered by the idea of a solution of the practice, the dry and the soft.
Because of the small kitchen, he restored the entire wall roof over the work desk.
The unique graffiti with digitally printed motivation is attractive, and it is well maintained.
Ivana chose flowers that remind her of a favorite fourth of her age.
Now it looks like she's still here.
In the original bathroom there was a small van and a washroom, and the new owner chose the neutral side of the building.
A big shower box has a locked door, Ronal.
The task was to create a clear, simple space in which functions and equipment would be in harmony with the environment.
The interior was materially and colorful and we tried its elegant, delicate, not too full of views.
"An additional condition of assignment was a non-barrier solution with a minimum obstacle and the possibility of easy movement around the supply and availability of daily needs," Kamila Douder adds.
The Supreme Court ruled: It can't slow down.
The Supreme Court decided that former Prime Minister Petra Necess could also be brought to trial for any criminal acts which he could have committed before the Serbian discharge of the Acts of Apostles.
She's only protected him by a process immunity that relates to phenomena in Snow.
In the case of former ODS MPs Ivan Fuksy, Mark Schnajdra and Petra Tluchore, however, decided that they could not be held accountable for any criminal acts until they had committed the execution of the parliamentary mandate in November, said the speaker of the Supreme Court of Petr Knötig.
In this decision, the Court rejected the proposal of the representative of State Ištvan, who wanted to continue in criminal proceedings with the delegation.
According to him, they have accepted payments in the form of lucrative positions in state firms because they give up their mandate and they will not make problems when they adopt laws.
On the other hand, the former prime minister who offered them these posts may continue to be impressed.
With Vit Barto, the police officers also arrested the anti-corruption police.
Bart's spokesman, Mr Chudoba, who also represented her in the case of a certain corruption of the VV Members, also did not want to express too much, but said, "Yes, I represent the client in this matter, but in view of the protection of the underlying facts, I can't continue to comment."
According to information The case is resolved by the General Security Council (GIBS).
The server Tn.cz indicated that Barta could buy private information from the police.
According to the server privnistöry.cz, the case may have been related to the case of former police president Petra Lessy, whose appointment to the function of Barta was clearly carried out.
The latest information of the Law, however, shows that the detention of Vita Barty with Petre Lessy is not compatible.
The speech of the police president Eva Kropča refused to comment on the case of the Persian city representative.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of the facts involved," said the City State Representative in Prague Štépánka Zenklov on Friday.
That is why the other applicant, Barto, observes the matter, and her words do not directly indicate that the written or criminal proceedings are carried out in the proceedings.
Reporter Novinek managed to arrest his wife, Viita Barty Katerín, on the morning of their stay in Prague.
She just put the suitcases in the car and left.
She refused to express herself to the whole event.
On Friday afternoon, at Bart's detention, the leader of the coup d'état directed Tomio Okamura.
He doesn't even know what's in the case.
"Vit Bárta was one of many candidates on our candidate, and as I said repeatedly before the elections, he was not even a member of the World's direct democracy, Tomia Okamura," he added.
Vít Bárta, who failed to succeed in his campaign to establish direct democracy in Slómovn in Płzeńsk, in his late prior elections, is known as his corrupt cause of the persecution of the Members of the Public.
In April 2012, he was wrongly sentenced to 18 months with 30 months' salary.
The judgment was later changed and Barta was released.
I want a contract in NHL.
I still have tea, tea, tea and tea.
She was always in the family’s first place, so she wanted to be fully supported in her 38 years.
Either you get a job in the sea and it's still extending your career, or it's definitely over with hockey.
"I want to fulfill my father's role and my husband."
"I'm so happy about it," says a hockeyist who still waits for a offer.
Despite the fact that he's a declared employee who never gets anything.
Despite the fact that every heart is left on the back, it can also be sneezed by the player.
And despite the fact that he was the most productive player in the late season of Columbus.
"But the touch to show me everything is still there," she exclaimed determinedly.
Maybe he's waiting, apparently he's in New York Rangers, and he didn't get into the season, and there's also two of them injured -- the attackers Rick Nashe and Ryan Callahan.
How does that look about your coming to Rangers?
They're just speculations.
If I don't have anything on the paper, it's not worth it.
I know the article went out in New York Post case to sign me, but that's all.
It was never added that it really happened.
Sorry, I'd like to announce to myself that I have a contract, but it's just not.
They didn't even call you from the club?
Such communication in NHL is conducted in a thorough manner.
That's where it's about to get into the situation when this contract really comes.
When a player gets hurt or he doesn't go to someone and he doesn't get hurt.
There are a lot of different factors that need to be met together in order for me to get this contract.
But there's a similar situation in New York, right?
They hurt Rick Nash with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't go into the season, so there's a certain chance there, don't you think?
Of course, that chance is always.
The second thing is that you always need two sides.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't got anything yet.
That's the sad reality I've got to live in.
On Friday, when you're going to America, are you expecting something to happen?
I've been expecting this since July 5th, when NHL opened up a market with free players, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remember?
I'm sure not. I'm going to Tampy for the kids and for the wife.
I'm happy to see you again.
Do you have any plans for your program?
That's because I'm a father and a husband and everything's going to be different.
I'm not a hockey player right now - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm gonna play my dad's and my husband and I'm so happy about that.
On Sunday your two hockey games, it's for me and my entire family Christmas when we can go to support our children in what they want to do.
Do you think you could do this in the introductions for full consideration?
Of course, a person can think of a lot of things.
And this can happen.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 pieces because of the knee surgery.
And I've had a lot of fun.
Once it gets to such a stage that all the balls, the winnings and the toys don't give you what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Do whatever you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could happen to me except my family.
You had a lot of offers from Europe: do you have it so that you want to play NHL just because it's NHL or because it's because of your family that you want to be in America?
Because I'm a hockeyist, so first - apart from families - it's also part of sports success.
NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life is all about.
My children, so I'm sorry, our children - my and my wives - grew up in the States, started going to school there, and so on.
And we would love to continue in this trend.
Because what we're going to say is, there's a lot of other options in America.
We should offer them such a chance.
So you're planning on staying in America forever?
We're gonna practice it like this.
That means we'll be in Czech summers in Hlubokka and around Czech Budějovic.
And in the winter they're back in Tampa or where our steps lead us.
It's perfectly ideal to be in the heat.
I had great happiness in my life.
It's said that I went against him, it's still a lot of strength and determination, and it's got me a lot of things that I've missed.
But hockey offered me a lot of options, and this is one of them.
That we can choose where we will live with our wife.
In the world, there are many people who yearn for it so that they can choose what they will do and how they will live.
How long will you have a desire to touch, to exercise hard, and to wait for the offer?
Yeah, so that's a question I can't answer.
Today, I still have it in me, there's a cup of tea, this bottle, it's a drink, it's a drink for the sport, it's a drink, it's a reason for people to prove that you're still on NHL that I'm always better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how long it'll stay there.
It's not going to be planned.
So it can be said that you're waiting for this season to develop and then decide what next?
I'm at the stage when I'm going from day to day.
The Czech Director-General recently announced that the decision on construction 3 and 4 block Temelin will expire at the end of 2014 or 2015.
This was prompted by the expectation of the new State's energy concept and the agreement of the Government's Contracts of Differences.
For this reason, the current leadership of the Czech Republic is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - thus for the majority of shareholders.
A qualified manager, however, should make recommendations rather than hide for him.

The Israeli press on the explosion in the database reported more on the rocket attack, but the Israeli government did not approve of it.
The Israeli army, on the question of CNN, refused to comment on the plane.
"We don't agree with the foreign media report," she said.
The purpose of the Israeli invasion was according to the U.S. government source of rockets and related equipment, which could, according to the Israelis, be transferred to the Lebanese army of Hizballah.
The AP Agency, calling on another US security agent, informed that the Israeli aircraft target target was Russian SA-125.
The second channel of Israeli television reported that the objective of the attack was a highly advanced modern Syrian anti-air defence system.
Satellite photos of the area of the attack, but according to DPA agency, showed the batteries of Russian rocket type S-125 New.
In addition, before they were seen, the SA-3 rocket battery including the leading center with the radar to monitor the rockets and their targets.
According to Israel’s TV reports, the number of rockets is 35 kilometers away and may be 70 pounds [70 kg] high.
Israel had already bombed the supply of rockets within Syria at least twice this year, indicating CNN and AP.
The Israeli army has never responded to such reports, repeatedly but has declared that they will be involved in any arms supply of Hizballah or other terrorist groups.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
The Flight Centre seems to be successful in achieving this trend.
The company updated the annual profit rate and expected the record profits from athletes in Australia and Great Britain.
The travel agency is now expected to move its annual basic profit before tax between 325 and 340 million USD to 305 million to 315 million from previous forecasts.
If the current development is maintained, it will represent a 12 to seven-percent increase against the recorded profit of USD 290.4 million from 2011/12.
Director General Graham Turner said that the Flight Centre created an eight-percent profit in the first half of the first and the second half of the first half of the year began early growth especially in Australian and British travel outside the service path.
"To date, our 10 countries of profits and several points to the record annual profit before rating and taxation," he said.
I belong to Australia and Great Britain, which are traditionally our biggest winners.
During the second half of Australia’s recreational activities, the market for business travel was reimbursed, which compensates for a mildly poor domestic market.
Similarly, in Great Britain, the Flight Centre has managed well in the recreation area, while business customers have lost less.
The US trade has been stranded after the fall of the season and is expected to lead to a series of full-year gains.
Flight Centre shares were 3 cents higher last night at the level of $38.20.
Active Greenpeace detained in Russia converted to Petrohrad
The ecologically active detentions from September in Russia due to the protest against planned rape in the Arctic have been transferred from Murmansk to Petrohrad.
She informed the AFP agency today with a call to the international environmental organisation Greenpeace.
This also claims that the original charges against its pirate activists have not been brought.
"Greenpeace International learned from diplomatic sources that three-thirds of the men and women detained in Russia after a non-violent action against the robin plant in the Arctic had been transferred from the repair facility in Murmansk to the Petrohrad prison," the organization announced in a statement.
The reasons for the transfer of detained activists are unclear; according to the DPA agency, there was a planned transfer.
The ecological authorities first accused them of piracy, which, in the event of their review, threatened them until 15 years of imprisonment.
Last week, however, they announced that this charge would be rewarded with a more peaceful discharge, which would threaten a lower punishment with the upper limit of seven years of freedom.
But Greenpeace, in today's press release, warned that the charges against the bureau's pirates have not yet been filed as vows.
This means that arrests are now charged with two criminal acts.
The Mighty Committee for the Investigation of the past week announced that the charges against the Pirate Bay will be reimbursed by the charges against the auction.
But when a third of the prisoners arrived before the committee this week, the charges against the Pirate Bay were not filed.
Instead, a new charge was raised against everyone," AFP quoted the Greenpeace statement.
The Russians held in the Gazprom's red zone in the half-seat three tenths of the Greenpeace strike members from 18 countries.
Ecologists were on the Arctic Sunrise boat, which floated under the Dutch train.
Since then, all of them have been involved in an appeal against each other, but the court has rejected them all.
Under conditions of imprisonment, the environment is troubled.
The Executive Director of Greenpeace Kumi Naidho, according to the AFP today, indicated that the transfer to Petrohrad is a simple meeting with families and consular staff.
However, there is no guarantee that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmanska.
"In fact, they can be worse," he warned.
With the help of Dutch King William-Alexandra, one of the detained activists of Faiza Olahsen.
In a written letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, the monarch called for him to discuss their situation at a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He claims that Malikí has a large share in the resurgence of sectoral violence in Iraq, which is also part of the fighting in nearby Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, legislation and grammar
In hours English literature will have to study at least one Shakespeare's game, a novel from the 19th century, a romantic poem and a contemporary British bet since 1914.
The test will also include "secret text" in order to motivate deeper reading;
The combined English literature and language courses will be abolished.
Since 2015, students will be required to have a master’s language test and will be invited to choose English literature as a voluntary subject.
The Ministry of Education should issue a new foundation for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first items to undergo radical change.
In other key items, changes are expected next year.
In an independent step, the Office of Ofqual, which looks at the maturitization tests, will see changes in the structure of the maturitary test, together with a new system of labelling and a smaller range of projects for students.
In his summer speech, Minister of School Michael Gove said that he is planning “a broad consensus on whether we need to reform our test system in order to regain confidence in the company” and that it is necessary to insist that the master’s test is “better, more ambitious and closer”.
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics — 116 hours a year or three hours a week — than most other countries.
To compare schools in Australia, mathematics is estimated to be 143 hours a year and in Singapore about 138.
Although there will be no formal requirement to spend more time on mathematics, coalition sources have indicated that a comprehensive math test – together with a greater emphasis on this subject in the resulting hybrids – is likely to encourage schools to provide more education.
The training plan will focus more on "the problems of the real world", including financial mathematics.
Eastern Prime Minister Kianr: Rakovinu in ČSSD I am not
Before the elections, there was a long conflict between the two wings fighting the influence of the ČSSD in the island.
It all came to an end when Ostravy Peter Kaynar turned to court for non-democratic candidate formation.
The perpetrators, however, did not want to express themselves too much so as not to harm the party before the elections.
But now the voices of the voters are cut.
The leadership of the ČSSD is now called on the Ostravy prime minister to come out of the country immediately on Monday night, and will obviously press for his role.
Peter Kanar wants to go on fighting.
What's going on in the race and who's on whose side he's on, he wrote in an exclusive conversation for Denmark.
How do you know the outcome of your choice?
ČSSD certainly counted with a much better result.
Did it hurt to us that they were solved in the media disputes inside the party before the elections?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better outcome.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which ČSSD is now.
It's a side that has its internal problems, it's a disease inside, and people think it's not all right.
They made it clear in the volleyballs.
What are those internal disorders ČSSD?
Unfortunately, I think ODS has been through some time, and things like this have unfortunately been playing in social democracy.
It's that lobbyists, influential people who used to expect to find their ancestors in ODS have moved to the people in ČSSD and have influence on them.
It's related to the fact that the police go after the offices of the Ostrava Master and collect computers.
This shows that ČSSD is not only composed of people who want the good of all others, but many of them think primarily of their own good.
ČSSD is divided into two dismal camps in Prague, as is seen in the current struggle between Haskovci and Sobotkovci.
But it's been getting ready for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a preview of what is going on in Prague.
The Haškov wing gradually covered the position so that after the elections it could cause a situation that weakened Sobot's wing.
A person is in a political situation when he has to compromise at times.
But everyone has some internal boundaries when these compromises are no longer made, and that's my case.
At first, I didn't want to apply for a recording, but when I noticed this whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Luboš Zaoralk that I would try to get to a national candidate so that I, as Ostravy's prime minister, could strengthen Sobot's wing.
Haškov's cross, but it's slowing down.
Why are you standing on the side of Bohuslav Sobotky, not Michal Haška?
Sobotka's key is I think the person who always talks primarily about the ČSSD programme and to some extent and about the vision for the side and for this country.
I admit I didn't hear anything like that on the other hand.
Michael Hashek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Presidency, which is a lower authority than the Central Executive Committee, can only start calling the Chair of the Parties.
It's a fight for power, regardless of everything, and I'm against the sides.
According to me, what Michael Hashek has now presented in Prague has ended his political career.
How did you realize that you were not approved by the ČSSD?
The political parties are based on competition, who will take place as their members.
This competition should be based mainly on programme visions and on the ability of these people to fill those visions.
Of course, there are people who are not very capable of seeing the competition, but the political side is for them a contribution to money that they would not otherwise have.
The problem is, when these people start getting to the point because they break the rules without resorting to bribes, they break the laws of the parties.
They do their practices on the political side of the Mafia, and I think they also violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
Warning about this problem is more important to me than taking into account whether a Kanar has any political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect the positions.
Is that why you have submitted a motion to the Court for a preliminary action against the likes of the ČSSD candidate in the country of Morazkoslez?
The current ČSSD Executive Committee in Ostrava confirms its power that organisations that do not comply with it can be cancelled, that is to say, the new organisation is to be set up, and that the members of the party are gradually disbanded.
For example, it may be that they wanted to expel Richard Bednarík from the representative's club, but he filed a complaint and then they rejected his resignation.
This shows that maintaining the state of the party across the courts is the last option, but at the moment when the other methods and control authorities have ceased to function within the ČSSD, this is the only option.
The attempt to lead the ČSSD in front of the Ambassador Adam Rykal is to withdraw you from the position of the host.
It's a public secret that at this post, the old man's behind Poruby Lumír Palyza.
That's right, Adam Rykal and Lumir Palyza are trying to do everything they can to get me back.
They promise people positions, they get votes, and then they're giving up their power on the side.
When I go back to the past, all I could have played around the football club Baník Ostrava and bought the baseal stadium was just a memory for them so they could attack me.
It was a gifted gift so they could mark me as a person who gives money where he doesn't belong.
In the immediate city, he bought a property that has a strategic value for him.
So how do you see that next time you're stuck in the office of the prime minister?
The Committee of the Regions has already called on me and other people on Monday to consider our stay in ČSSD.
But I think it's like when the thief screams, "Get the thief!"
When we look at the results of my work in the last few decades, I see no one in the Soviet social democracy who would start and pass, sometimes even against the members of the party, the result of so many developments such as the need for industrial areas or the expansion of the scientific and technological park.
Still, I'm becoming uncomfortable.
I don't read it unless I interrupt the others so they can spend the rest of their lives at the places they're looking for.
Are you going to try something else against this?
Because if this Republic is to function well, it must also work well with political parties.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to effectively run a state if he cannot control himself.
So I don't think I'm leaving ČSSD now because I think that the one who's making this page's cancer is not me, but these people who are trying to test me.
Olomouc Opens in the historic center of the public club
The organizer of the Olymous Christmas Markets and the winter solstice Paul Spalený stated that the preparatory work at the club was started on October 26th, and from midsummerly it is being carried out in the production of ice.
The ice type is already seven inches [7 cm] strong and the surface will be ready for the first visitors on Friday morning.
It has a square area of 375 meters, and the podium took 358 square meters.
Bruslars and co-existants will also have two chairs with a plate.
"We have expanded the floor floor, increased the space before the walls, and almost the entire floor of the floor is crushed so that the drillers can move freely," said the burnter.
The streets of Ololouce are already reminiscent of the nearby Christmas.
Loni was placed in a club just before the main entrance of the workshop in the upper room because of the lower deck.
The floor was completed at the end of the year, so the ice sheet could return to its original location.
First, people could break up right before the workshop in 2009, when the club was operating from January to March.
The ice sheet then became an integral part of the summer markets in the city.
The evening markets, which are part of a rich cultural program, will begin in the Sermon on the Mount a month before the Friday day.
Pamela Anderson left the iconic blond cadres and set up a new, dramatic growth nurse.
The burning blond hair is famous because of her role in the sex TV show Coast Guard.
Pamela Anderson is the most recent celebrity who has shot his fans in a new role.

The brutal murder of seniors in Zlinsk will be re-solved by the national court
The Court of State condemned the complaint of the five-year-old Slovak and the two-year-old Czecha for lack of evidence.
The men refused the guilt.
They are threatened with imprisonment for 15 to 20 years or with extraterrestrial punishment.
The speaker, Peter Angyalossy, confirmed that the Supreme Court rejected the decision of the country and returned the matter to the trial.
The reasons given to the judge refused to comment on the fact that the decision had not yet been given to the parties.
Sad to say, the young men crossed the seven - year - old man into his home.
Senior died of a tragic death.
Unfortunately, her men cut her, beat her, and beat her whole body with a metal object, apparently a gas gun, and put about three tenths of the wound in her head.
The man suffered serious injuries, such as broken bone bones, stroke of the brain, or bleeding into the brain that he was exposed to.
The young men of the house reportedly brought some 3,000 kroner and some 14,000 kroner in value.
According to the national court, they were the only indirect evidence against the alleged step of hunting, which the expert felt was not fully found within the meaning of the legal instructions.
In more than ten cases, the passports from the place of work were consistent with the suspects, however, the police began to charge them with the essentials and not the passports.
In addition, there was a certain misunderstanding with them.
According to the Senate, the wine of the accused was not shown without any doubt.
However, the court found that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head found neighbors who thought he had fallen down and wounded himself.
She did not even notice the violent death of a doctor called the rescue service.
Criminals contacted doctors who showed signs of violent death after a few days.
The police could no longer work with all the steps from the place where the neighbors had calmed down.
There was no DNA found in the place.
The young Slovak lived in Uherskohradšk.
Now he's been rehabilitating the 8,5-year sentence that Loni's law-enforced Supreme Court has confirmed.
The man, according to him, was the head of a group of six young people, who had a sudden overcrowding of gold.
Loupés took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of seniors in Slopné.
The younger of the accused of the murder of seniors lives in the Uhersk City.
The court released him in August, 11 months later.
It starts again with the reconstruction stage
At the beginning of November, it will begin at the Reconstruction of the football stadium.
On Thursday, the stadium was surrounded by buildings that were reconstructing the mine.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojma is divided into four stages in order to reflect standards for the first football league.
Living legend Wayne Shorter closes next week Strony winter
The Saxphone Great and the legend of the Wayne Shorter railway scene will make the next middle of the 18th anniversary of the Struny Winter Festival.
Shorter will be released on 6 November in the Grand Hall of Lucerny together with its square in the compositions of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
On the second half of the night, the Spontaneous railway improvisation of PKF - Prague Philharmonic under the direction of Martin Kumžáka is added to Shorter.
In Shorter's shorts for a symphonical orchestra, Pegasus boasts a new album with Without A Net, as well as his older stock of Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although this year celebrated the 18th birthday in August, Shorter is still full of power, which also proves that the Prague concert on the Lowlands resumes his world tournament.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than sixty years ago.
A number of the interpreters he worked with were taken from Miles Davis through Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell, and Carlos Santan.
He also met with Czech singer Miroslav Vitoše and visual father, Joe Zawinul, who, in the legendary Weather Report after more than a decade, gave direction to the new style merger.
He's been dating Wayne Shorter Quartet for the last thirty years.
Jakousi afternoon party after the festival will still be a club night Spotlight, which will take place on November 9th in the Roxy/NoD club.
According to charismatic singer Andrey Triany, a manchester trio Go Go Penguin presents to the Turkish audience the Manchester Trio Go Penguin with his jacket influenced by electronic and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, which brings the electro-jessive formation of the Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
The customs office of destination shall order UEFA to publish penalties for the decision-makers.
Dagmar Damk, president of the Committee of the Co-decisions of the CR Football Association, has ceased to issue sentences for the court.
It is prohibited by the UEFA rules, which led to a discussion of the Law.
In the latter case, the FACHR would have threatened the status of the FACHR.
The Damk also refused to give the photoballists their function, wherever they came from.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in Plzni, but the other members of the Commission are separated, for example from Prague.
So in the case of vote I can win 1:6,” Damk announced in response to the criticism that broke out after the Plenary played twice as penalt as many times as the rest of the medical teams.
Even though the FAČR has ceased to publish sentences for the decision-makers in recent months, Damkov ensures that they regret their mistakes.
"Believe me that if the Commission finds out that the decision-makers have made a mistake, it will limit the delegation to any delay," Damk said.
The reason why the penalties are not made public is according to the Danish law of the European Union.
"UEFA prohibits the disclosure of such information and the infringement of the strict penalty."
"We're very suspicious and we're looking for something for every mistake."
"We have published the restrictions, but I have received two very serious warnings that if we don't stop, severe sanctions will come," said Damk.
The other countries respect the ban.
"We were really the exception," he added.
If information was to continue to be published, the Commission could draw up funds from UEFA for the development and development of decision-making.
"And they are very important to us."
"Without them we would not be able to complete a decision-makers training program," Damk added.
Barty's detention is related to Janusch and Belem: Are you a messenger?
The President of the Public Vice-President Bart arrested the police on Thursday.
He was also arrested by the board of directors of anti-corruption police Jan Petržílek.
Detention related to the missions of lobbyists Roman Januszka and former prime minister Paul Béma (ODS).
Information on the delegates who came with the news server Novinky.cz confirmed the Czech press office a reliable source.
The phone calls of Janouska and Béma, which appeared in March in the newspaper Young Front Today, and in which both men speak together "Mazánk" and "Kolibrík", show the impact of Janousk's influence on the city's steps under the direction of Bém.
At that time, Danik stated that in 2007 the Security Information Service (BIS) was established, from which two years later it was transferred to the ABL Security Agency.
This is where Barta owns it.
Server Novinky.cz warned that a detained criminal Petržílek was working in front of his way to the anti-corruption police right for BIS.
To the anti-corruption facility that was subsequently killed, Petržílek passed at the same time when it was published.
"With regard to the law on protection of confidential information, I can't confirm anything or say anything," complainant Michal Muravsky of the City State Representative in Prague said.
He refused to confirm that the case was being watched.
The case does not want to comment on the same reason.
The new public law prepares six companies of ten
The effectiveness of the new civil law and the Law on Trade Corporations as of 1 January 2014 is being intensively prepared for six companies from ten.
Only eight per cent of the company's respondents indicated that the concerns associated with both key codes in their company had not been resolved at all.
This is the result of a study by the law firm Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which found the views of 108 Czech companies.
In the context of the close-up period of operation of both key codes, a number of managers are starting to understand how they can have a significant impact on the business of their company.
The biggest changes in private law over the last 50 years are the same as we think all citizens and companies in the PRC.
The business sector has lived in uncertainty for a long time because of policy laundering whether or not the revolutional change will come to an end.
"But it is only a few weeks longer for them to pass on a new right for their companies without complication," commented partner Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spáčil.
Of the 61 per cent of companies actively seeking new laws, 26 per cent indicated that their companies had already taken all the necessary measures to be prepared in time.
More than 35 per cent of companies are willing to take the necessary measures in the near future.
In contrast, every fifth company has not yet been covered by the recodifications, although it has a specific idea of how to prepare for them.
At least 11 percent has no opinion and the problem cannot be resolved.
Only eight per cent of companies recognise that the recodification concerns have not yet been resolved.
The most important legal issue related to the new citizen law is the largest number of companies involved in the conclusion of the new contracts (21 per cent), followed by the settlement of trade terms (16 per cent) and further changes in the capital and liability for damages (by 10 per cent).
The contract reflects one of the most important recoding newspapers, which is a combination of the revision of the contract only under the new civil law.
The current parallel adjustment in the civil and commercial law will disappear, as a result of which the contractual law should become more transparent for citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, a new adjustment will offer a lot of news with a view to greater freedom of planning of relations," a lawyer Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Lukáš Poddany warned.
With regard to the Law on Trade Corporations, it is considered to be the most important theme of almost a quarter of the company's problem of increasing the liability of statutory authorities.
The following are the topics relating to changes in the admission and duration of the wave collection (15 per cent) and the representation of the company (14 per cent).
A new legal adjustment means the consolidation of obligations and possible consequences for the statutory authorities, particularly in cases where the company is at risk or is affected by the accident.
"In practice, this means that if members of the representatives and the executives of the company do not deal with the care of the proper economy and the non-repetition of the dangerous consequences of the company, they can benefit from the performance of the function up to the last two years," Spačil added.
Pierre Rainero: I'm trying to develop Carter's style as a living language
My task is to keep tradition and at the same time to bring our sign to the modern thing so that it will not remain a dirty relic, explains in a speech to the UN its position Pierre Rainer, director of style in Cartier company.
This French luxury house was built in 1847.
He travels through the pool, river and jungle and provides medical care free of charge
Dr. Georges Belle provides free medical care in the neighborhoods in Cameroon.
Belle and his team will heal almost every week hundreds of patients.
There are not too many doctors in West Africa; only one per 5,000 inhabitants.
Listen here or through your cell phone.
Dr. Georges Belle is one of the 10 main candidates for the 2013 CNN Award.
In the 2013 CNN price competition, you can vote for it or for any other of the 10 main candidates.
He's gonna get $250,000 so he can go on in his extraordinarily hard work.
For the past 21 years, Georges Belle has been following his father, how he again turns out to be unconscious and goes to a hospital that was not equipped to help him.
In 1981, James Belle was injured in a car accident near the main city of Kamerun Yaounde.
He was first treated only with broken hands, but then he had an infection that spread to his brain, and there he developed a haematoma that caused his whole life's problems.
"There were no neurosurgery in Cameroon," says Georges Belle.
We'd have to take him outside Cameroon if we had money for it.
Instead, Belle spent years transporting his father to a crowded clinic and a hospital where he received a treatment that was just available.
"It's not easy," says Belle.
You can leave home at five in the morning, go to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients there.
Some people just die because they have to wait.
Since 2002, when Belle's father died, the situation hasn't changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor in Cameroon for 5,000 citizens.
For comparison only, in the United States, one doctor is a 413 citizen.
And even if doctors were able to visit Cameroonians, many wouldn't allow it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line and almost three quarters of health care expenditure in this country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Belle.
They can't enjoy life because of poverty.
When Belle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Belle and his volunteer team conducted 700 operations last year.
I became a surgeon at the central hospital in Yaounde.
And he established the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit the rural areas where they provide medical care free of charge.
Since 2008, nearly 32,000 people have been assisted by their volunteer groups.
Nearly every Friday he and up to 30 people are moving to supply, adds to medical supplies, and travel through hard terrain to villages that need help.
It's not always a lucky thing.
He must immediately press the vehicle through the river and the bow.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed as real heroes: the host, the song and dance and the best accommodation the community can offer.
In these neighborhoods, medical care is really a cause for celebration and Belle – with its wide smile and unsound energy – is very willing to join in the local party.
The next day the team starts treating hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients for each treatment," says Belle.
They're coming to the village 60 kilometers away, and it's sand.
During each of these weeks doctors provide various medical assistance.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, obesity, diabetes, parasitic diseases, and mostly transmitted diseases.
Another can get beer or gifted glasses or a free family letter – a document that requires school, but which can only afford a lot of loved ones.
Tonight, the team's doing simple surgery under the local drug.
The surgery usually takes place at the building school, at the workshop or at home; after the surgery the patient rises up and goes to the washroom to release the place to another patient.
Thanks to light from the generator, operating rooms and health equipment, Belle and his volunteers work in the early hours of the morning.
It's overwhelming, but local musicians usually help the team not to lose the motivation.
"To stay up and go on at work, they play on drums all night," says Belle.
On Sunday, the team intends to return to the city, tired but proud of its work.
This group – consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has conducted 700 free operations last year and is aware that their assistance can be of great importance to local citizens.
One man said that after the surgery the kilns would be able to work again.
"It will change our family's future," said the man.
In addition to organizing these weekly clinics and surgery in Belle hospital, he also works at night for private medical clinics around the city of Yaounde.
It says that this second job finances about 60% of its non-profit activities; the rest cover private contributions.
"I'm not sure when he actually sleeps," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine at Drex University in Philadelphia and works as a volunteer for the Belle group.
He's always in the hospital, or he's trying to get money for the organization so he can do this campaign.
For medical and hospital students like O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Belle in his mission, it's a great practice that they wouldn't get home.
"Dr. Wellem, we did wash our hands thoroughly and remove blood clots or we kept our tools," says O'Malley.
You're never living as a medical student in America in the second year.
Students of volunteers usually pay their way to Cameroon on their own and often meet with donated medical needs.
But as soon as they get to Yaounde, the fear, the transport and the studio will provide them with Belle.
"Surely it's a mountain," says O'Malley.
This organization gives its life and its enthusiasm to help the inhabitants of Cameroon is endless.
It's not a burden for Belle's permanent closure.
Helping another person to live a happier life, fulfilling a promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this work," says Belle.
And I mean my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
To solve people, to alleviate their pain – that's why I do it.
Look at the ASCOVIME website and find out how you can help.
Minister Holcát restored the function of the Chief Sisters for the ČR
The main sister for the ČR should represent the interests of the health sisters whose number in Czech exceeds 100 thousand.
"I consider it essential that these functions be clearly defined and formalised so that the health sisters of their representatives should have their representatives in the structure of the office - representatives who can always turn to them if necessary," explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate my sister's work, and I think that the Committee of Hospitals deserves to be held accountable for her, as well as for the ministry.
In carrying out this call, there is a need not only for high professionalism but also for human access and personal conviction.
"My pleasure and all responsibility will be to try to implement the steps that can improve the position of health sisters."
"We have beautiful and beautiful sisters in our health, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us with their access to patients too much to perform all the empathy and help us to improve the picture of the sister in public," says Alan Šmídová.
A new-named chief nurse for ČR Alan Šmídová, on the occasion of her introduction to the function, also indicated that she wants to remain in the most diverse aspects of the working position of the nurse and is willing to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, educators, other non-medical professionals and physicians.
"I don't really want to share the call of doctors and sisters, but instead I see them standing next to me, while everyone has their competence and with other medical workers creates a group of people who provide health services for the patient."
"I'm meeting myself with a number of problems that arise when a sister calls out, which I can't understand, and I'm willing to share in their solutions."
These include, for example, simplifying medical and medical documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some of the administrative tasks of sisters are extremely complicated and take the time they could and should pay more patients," says Alan Shmíd.
Other areas where it is likely to be targeted include improving working conditions, finding ways to improve mutual cooperation in the team and with the management of health services providers, adjusting competences and also labour law issues, such as keeping the law of work or not exceeding their sister in the time and place.
We often hear anonymous comments, which are not documented on a particular case where the rules could be broken.
"Where there is no complainant, no judge, and so the function of the Chief Sister of the ČR could serve as a guarantee of the preservation of such anonymity and a specific case to let the competent authorities check," says Alan Šmídová.
Ms. Alena Šmídová studied at the Medical School in the field of Health Sisters (in 1978) and at the University of Karlov University in Prague in the study programme Osätörvätä - pedagogica (in 1992).
Since 2010, it has been acting as the leading branch of care and other non-medical committees and the recognition of qualifications for the Committee on Education and Science.
During her professional career she worked as a nurse in the interior department, further acting as a teacher at the Secondary Medical School, where she had been a statutory deputy director for eight years.
From 2004 to 2009, she became the chief sister of the ČR Association Service.
She published several professional nursery teachers and articles in professional journals, and she engaged in nursery activities.

So I don't get mad at hate
Writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after 12 years.
After years of reading, living, but not writing, VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) released a new Roman Friday, dark, presence.
He says that he does not care about the strike, the number of parties is comparable to his most famous part of Houston (Peter, 2001).
For Salon Kahudu, another famous Czech contemporary writer - Emil Hakl.
Where did you get the impression that you wrote a novel after 12 years of silence?
I've done it - so I don't hate it.
The new and new clones of the human path of minorityism, young organisms made up of blind self-esteem efforts.
I don't even talk about us older people, faces destroyed by the powerless demand, whiskers, and misreading ideologists who are trying to sell their "product" with the expression of a little saleswoman.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a little digital camera and set up my legal friends, admirers and hideouts.
I've been through it.
Sometimes I feel as if my life on this planet is burning my brain.
I don't think I'd rather go on a walk and then I'll be in the lamp reading books tonight.
You're talking about a sense of shame, hate.
Was there some kind of evil in the past that affected you, or are you just getting old like all of us?
It's been a long time. It's been a mess for ten years.
It didn't have a name then.
Well, I lived after that.
There's still an amazing quiet boy in there somewhere.
I can see more personal whickeys, everyone in my tower of excitement.
It saved me from writing books.
I participate in this balanced, lasting thousands of years of movement of the life system on this planet - that's an incomprehensible future.
The mindless, life-threatening complexity of every stone is the direct ancestor of our presence.
We are players of sad and beautiful games, when the path of try-omyl creates further and further generation of habitats, which in the billions of interactions in seconds creates some supernatural, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years are relatively long.
Do you consider your writing a routine process, or did you start with a zero?
A conversation, or a better spoken dialogue, that leads to the right and left half of the brain, is sometimes poured into the stomach and formed into the book.
As the period of peace is affected by those sleeping metastases of war, which may one day wake up - so my book is twelve years of cover-up.
I felt like I've had a wild life growing in my brain, and if I don't do anything, then one day I'll get caught up in silence.
It's a question of the brain, and it's a kind of thing that's put in the darkness "under the realm of knowledge".
Neucortex, sitting behind the brain core, asking for older evolutionary defenses, is going to the early strokes of the brain tree.
He's talking to a bunch of snakes, he's asking for answers in birds' flight, he's raising his eyes to the clouds.
Yes, the law of darkness is in me, and the star heaven is above me.
At last, the brain is asking for the world.
You're relatively often exposed to eg metaphorics - would you be able to define it biologically?
The brain keeps in its billions of connections and electrical connections all memories, experiences and experiences that the person has experienced.
This logistic and emotionally and emotionally exposed forest with trees of information, memory registers, uses the brain in its identifying, cognitive, process, it is displayed constantly changing presence, in an unexplained effort to name and understand its environment and decode important communications.
Sometimes they'll get overloaded.
Analogically - like you'll "spin" PC, from a word emulator program and a translator from other languages, you'd be asked first in the operating environment, for example Windows, and after a number of failed replays ended up in a dark greening picture of Bios, in a basic system that manages functions and collaboration on the motherboard, between processor and operating memory, etc.
I'm talking about a psycho-spiritual crisis for someone who has never understood what it is.
You're talking about her often - why do you care about this type of regression?
'Cause it's a jama.
In terms of the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior, we are first exposed.
It's good to read to Nietzsche: "He's been looking for a long time to ruin when the disaster looked at him."
The smile - that a person is lost if he loses all hope, mental "death" and develops a new quality.
And why do I care about it personally?
I'll answer the question.
And when one fell into a deep sleep, and the sun and moon and the years passed, he continued to warm and read, and the books taught him to swim, and then to live.
He's become a "crowd."
Maybe someone can help me with some written knowledge, like the Hrabal's texts have helped me.
To what extent do you think of a reader, a specific person who will read your text?
The one who can't tell anything about it makes sense, some call it a science, another superege, I think, but Arthur Rimbaud described it best in a friend's letter:
"I'm someone else -- this reader participates directly in the process of word and sentence formulation."
From early childhood, he read books of old Czech adventures, sailed to the bottom of Captain Nema, and ran after Stinadle in dark streets.
At the same time, after all the debate between the authors and their message, it says, "The sun shines in the worlds of other Karl Hynka Machy."
What if the book's out?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
The feedback that comes to you from people who read what I'm reading?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred roots and are willing to read five hundred pages of text.
And then, years later, they may be able to contact me on the street properly and thank me for helping them in some difficult decision in their life.
The books are actually "living" or "world" better.
They are encoded in letters, they are not experience, the history of regions of which language.
Whenever we can wake them up to life by letting their minds pass into the brain.
It's actually, in its own way, something forbidden by God - to predict more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It's the fact that DNA is placed into the magic - according to old demonic books, we'll allow magic.
After the book is published, you - how it is - waits for a series of authors to read.
I remember you used to like it.
Are you going back to that again with joy, or do you feel that after years?
I'd rather tell you today.
And what did I find out?
There are good intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic signs - they're harmless, they don't pay attention to themselves, they have friends, you don't feel lonely with them.
I give an example - in the village of the village of Montenegro the village was (and I hope he is still alive) one who buys a kitchen (also known as the village of Chervenka), a happy campsite and a good girl's apartment.
At one drink, he presented me with a series of articles from my book Houstin readers.
I looked them in the eye, and then I was shown a broken copy of my book.
I put down a broken cigarette in my pockets, and a few men cried.
We've all been there, we've all been sitting there, we've been kissing, and we've got drunk.
Then the young blond moon didn't hold it and he jumped his head out of the window into the snow.
It was on the ground.
We fled to the nightly landscape and ate the happy excitement of the sufferers, the sick souls of the peasants and the same western owners - went out and huddled as the trainers until the morning.
Each of your books is formally and contains other than those of the past.
Is it also about the text of the Wind, the darkness, the presence?
It's a story.
It's a plot of one country behind the nine rivers and the nine o'clock.
Ivan Bunin, in his new Suchodol, puts in his mouth the words of one old Russian fear: on the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
She's lying, she's sitting on her chest.
Scream, fear, secrecy.
It never happened, but we all know it somewhere.
Maybe we've been Devils in hell for a long time, and we're going to play the role of this earth.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to let it go again on the free flow of inspiration?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Bresina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
The enormous and countless, similar motion of continents on the planet affects our desires from such depths and in such a wide extent that it completely overemphasizes our view - and thus, of course, we run precisely in the interests of our programmed task.
We have been replaced with a few dopamines, endorphins and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to get together, die in the arms and acquire new personal territories.
Sometimes it turns out to be a mistake and we're going to have a conscience.
Only then do we have the right to call people.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various bugs, standing on the coast of the unknown ocean, and into the barren beaches made from the spinal capillary catch the breath of fresh air.
I have to write so I can be human.
Botha leaves health care.
Following his criticism yesterday, President Obama came up with his frequent repeated and ambitious promise that “if you like your health program, you can leave it.”
With a call for hundreds of thousands of notifications from the Republican suppliers, the President of the United States has been accused of breaking up the U.S. public in recent days.
Yesterday Obama broke his original promise.
"Most people who have functional health insurance can leave them," he said in his statement in Boston.
In view of what he called the "media riot" on the charges, Obama called the Americans who received these notifications to look for new security on the market.
Most people will be able to have better, more complex health care program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
Its administration argues that it should not be surprising that 5 per cent of the citizens who bought insurance themselves could be introduced to change the programme because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Law on Available Care.
"I say this to the Americans at the same time: you deserve something better," said Sebelius in his report to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sebelius, who looks at the implementation of the Law on Available Care, said that the release of the Internet market came from October “dangerous”.
"I am ashamed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I'll try to get your trust back.
Mr Sebelius's speech, which he had taken with the microphone, was directed yesterday to the councillor sitting behind her at the Committee's yesterday meeting, which took place following a heated exchange of views with the Republican Billy Long, representative of Missouri on whether she had to join Obama's care programme.
For more than three hours during the hearing on Sebelius's return, he answered the question why the "architect" of the available care law did not voluntarily grant to the government of sponsored insurance, and did not purchase a program through HealthCare.gov, which now attracts millions of Americans.
Which billionaire will you call next year?
Keller, owner of the PPF group, wants to buy operator O2.
Both companies have confirmed and according to the most diverse resources from the agency and from the backup are already hand in hand.
The transaction notification should be received in November, probably before the start of the LTE frequency auction, then before 11 November.
Keller's competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG group.
This was released under the label Sazka Telecommunications to the auction frequency for the LTE network.
And to the general surprise, it didn't talk about the company's hotness in telecommunications until then.
Only Sazku now leads a very experienced telecommunications mask of Robert Chvatal.
He started as a marketing director of Radiomobile (now T-Mobile), later became the director of the Slovenian T-Mobile, and later the head of the Raquel branch of the same operator.
The bag's playing a couple of cards right now.
She signed up for auction and now she admits she wants to launch a virtual in Vodafon.
And it gives logic.
If the auction succeeds, you will be able to move to your network with existing customers from your own virtual operator.
This would probably not be acceptable under the normal circumstances of Vodafon, but according to the Economic News, it could be part of much more cooperation between the two companies.
Vadaphones are currently under the agreement of O2 and T-Mobile competitive operators, who will fully share their network.
The waterphone needs a partner like that.
And it could be the Sazka.
If it succeeds in the tendon on the LTE network (as a novel can attract a specially designed spectrum), Vodafone will not be allowed to fly into the auction at all, it will not lead to the execution of only a limited spectrum (not sufficient frequency for all).
The vodafone can share the network with Sazko.
Vodafone leaves Sazku to its 2G/3G network (compared to the newly built LTE network at 900 MHz), allowing the firm to start the network quickly.
The gap between this will start to build a costly LTE network that will also be able to use Vodafone.
The two companies can be set up.
The amount of money that is spent on Vodafone could then be spent on some of the Internet or cable TV providers.
What about Kellner?
He would buy the Czech and Slovenian O2 (Slovenian branch is the daughter of Czech) immediately obtained the full value of the operator with still listening gains and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big mollusks that will wait for restructuring.
In the auction, the LTE network would already get Kellner for O2 and very likely in line with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already declared that they will share the network.
The auction could eventually end up successful, but probably not with the high amounts on which the state budget is pleased.
And since next year, customers in Czech could choose between calling with Vodafon, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárk.
Aneb two titanies of the Czech business against the global image.
Is Czech TV ever going to be covered without signatures?
The President of the Earth has launched a legendary stage with a fireplace, so it is not difficult to listen to the problems that gather evidence of a mountain race.
In the past, no one has documented the traditional influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Trudíka, so that he could sign it.
True, management has become editors.
The cases described do not provide the answer to the question of where such an attachment of some journalists to the church citizens - whether it is a direct order reaction or not to use vulgarism, a typical phenomenon of non-local empathy.
And if we are already assuming general prosperity, we can't forgive the question of whether the change in television rates does not encourage others, at least unsrupulous potential interests that have not yet been made available.
It is true that those who say that successful countries do not come to extreme attempts to intervene in the media.
It is also true that this does not mean that there would be no public media problems.
The complainants do not question their independence.
Rather, they criticize what they consider to be the tendency of their own, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven't reached this civilization stage yet, and we don't have this situation.
But maybe in a country where he thinks he is the most corruptest in the world, the blackest stories of bad politics and good journalists are more comfortable than the more complicated descriptions of the invisible situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings is threatened.
JAN JANDOREK: The curse of this country: President of the country of power
It is almost the rule that in key countries there was no head of state in such a way as to fulfil its state obligations.
If T. Masaryk were physically and mentally five years younger, he would have experienced the end of his presidential period and the events around Munich would have been a little different.
We would probably not win the war, but after a symbolic struggle, it could fly across the border, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could get to London right now and not fight for its legitimacy.
And mainly, it wouldn't have a nation of coke today.
Benez was not a stateman and he was still in a condition for Minichov, but in the war, he started to go out of his head, and in February 48 he was acting according to it.
In order to do something better, he could go into exile and break the legitimacy of the communists and their pits.
He's talking about the damage.
They called him "the President will not get into the situation to resolve."
He just had to, even though the big decision was not with a knife in Hitler's office.
During the last days of March 1939, the chief of research, Frantisek Moravec, said that everything should be done so that the occupation, which he knew about the day, did not pass on to the Germans so smooth and with such a profit.
The senior president and the federal government didn't do anything, but they didn't believe him, but they were afraid.
The human trophies Gottwald allowed him to repair his flying cooperatives, as Moscow showed him.
The people of the Freedom definitely failed to share in normalization and had to sit with him, all old-fashioned.
That Husak was a weak and sick depressive old man of action in November 89, but that's the only record.
Havel was lucky he wasn't seen in the office for the last few years, he was the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis player, but many of his actions make it clear that thinking processes are no longer what they were.
Well, now we've got this.
The head of state and the senior commander of armed forces seems to be, and we still don't know everything.
Unfortunately, there is no threat to the external threat of the Republic now.
Or maybe it's dangerous, but it's not like that.
Then the question is whether it is entirely wrong (from a historical point of view) that the president is not at all in force.
It's a normal attitude, but it's not.
Would we not be able to choose a president in this country once again someone who is friendly and healthy?
Remote planets, black movies or some fantasy about foreign life on earth are not the topics that American jazz saxafonist Wayne Shorter would raise iceblows.
In his quarter, on November 6th, Lucerny finished the annual festival of Struny in the spring, but everything is connected to everything.
The square of Wayne Shorter's railway saxophones is the instantaneous emotions of musicians.
According to his mission, two generations of younger colleagues are playing what they just enjoy.
They access music as a fully improvised comic book and think about harmony or rhythm, even in movies.
This principle is also pure 80-year-old Shorter - extraordinarily composer, carrier nine Grammy, some co-player Miles Davis and today's biggest live jazz saxafonist - does not like to explain.
He does not talk too much about music, even though his overall view of life is connected to music.
In my 80 ’ s, I came to the conclusion that the best thing to do is to let it surprise my life.
"You get a lot of people planning everything and then they're lying when things get different," Shorter says.
How Thai ants lifted the markets of the Paris Bar
Maybe you're sneezing over the hum and don't worry that you eat it half a kilogram a year just willingly.
For example, it's deep in the chest.
If you consume it knowingly, then you are a unique trend: it is ecological, viable and you have a unique experience.
The offer of the wedding was first arranged in Paris on the food list of his company at the beginning of October Elie Daviron, cook and owner of the Le Festin Nu bar.
Bar, whose name was the inspiration of the book William Burroughs Nahy, would be found in the fashion 18th season near Montmartru, a very visited tourist.
With pure avocados, cooked red peppers, cheese and cream beads, the guests can taste more than just different varnishes, beddings or water bubbles, and enjoy themselves here.
Supplies (to avoid injury to the skin, to the legs, or to the eyes) send to Daviron from Thailand.
Europe is learning to eat honey, or else it's common.
The owner of the Paris Bar with the popup menu immediately gives a few reasons why to consume just a ham.
First of all, it is ecologically productive because the production of moisture is much less expensive for our planet (which relates to finance, space and water consumption) than the traditional mass.
"In addition, honey is an excellent source of protein and omega of 3 fatty acids," said Daviron to Reuters station.
Likewise, a young cook does not close his profession, simply prepares to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, he makes the right restaurant of pleasure, sense of sin and the environment.
"I don't save the world, I'm just putting on a new experience," he explained.
Not everyone would be able to imagine how to consume the broccoli of a favorite song, but the reactions of the customers of the Paris bar to the serviced home are very positive according to the owner.
Even skeptics may wish to finish, even if they start with these smallest neighbours and until they finally choose a scorpion.
The prices of these amplifiers are moving from five to nine euros.
President Václav Mateyaš: New green support I should continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction has resulted in a continuous decline in the number of orders and the State is not interested in resolving the investment building problem.
The presentation of the New Green Support Programme was a positive signal for our construction, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises in different regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, following the implementation of the measures, slow down significant amounts for printing, but also opportunities for construction companies and manufacturers of construction materials.
Each invested billion will bring the state more than 2700 new jobs created.
In terms of state fiscal policy, there are significant package and multiplicity effects, including one of the most significant growth measures.
The number of enterprises in construction in the PRC is therefore essentially not in agreement with the government's solution and calls for such steps to be taken, which would allow further continuation of the programme to be made available in its framework.

Pes shrnul copper, president buried and finished with berylls
President Miloš Zeman left the motorcycle hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night on the bed, and went to the castle in Lánech.
What kind of health is he in?
In a previous confession John Kerry said the American spy "was going too far"
John Kerry pointed out a change in the U.S. defence status with regard to his monitoring programmes, and in his prior acknowledgement, he said that in some cases Spain “was too far away”.
The Foreign Minister also acknowledged that he and Barack Obama were responsible for the fact that, in view of the false disclosure of the spy activity of the NSA, which appeared thanks to the informant Edward Snowden, they acted as a "autopilot".
Public information has created a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr. Kerry, through a video-link to an open government conference in London, said: “There is no doubt that the president and I and the others in the government have actually learned about some things that have been done since this opportunity was here, with reference to the second world war, the difficult period of the war, and of course, 11 September."
Thus, he became the first highly established member of the U.S. government to admit that the American spy crossed the border but stressed that no rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it went too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain and explain this to people and is now conducting a thorough examination so that no one should feel that abuse has occurred.
I assure you that this process will not lead to abuse of the rights of innocent people.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was making good progress and that her tracking operations saved many lives.
He added: “We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to fire themselves.”
There is radical extremism in the world, which is strongly committed to killing people in the air and attacking governments.
And what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we've been preventing airplanes, buildings, and people from falling apart, because we've been able to find out about these plans before.
The president of the Senate's Committee on European Affairs on Thursday said that US lawmakers are moving to Europe to respond to foreign concerns related to certain American spies, and convinced Europe that they should continue to join their forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that this week he spoke to members of the European Parliament and other persons and that he was concerned about their concerns that he would stop participating in anti-terrorist organisations because they were disappointed by the monitoring of the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the national security interests of the United States, it is really important that Europe remain on one ship with us, in view of the joint efforts to combat terrorism, said in a discussion with Washington Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and chairman of the Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee for European Affairs.
And I go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their relationship with the NSA programmes.
News in the media that the NSA has collected millions of phone records in Europe, broke relations with some American allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were vague and reflected in the misunderstanding of metadata collected and shared with the United States by NATO associations,
Further disclosure read documents revealed by Snowden that the NSA was watching the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angely Merkel and some 34 world leaders.
The director of the National Report, James Clapper, told the liaison spy as necessary and said that it was one of the most common concerns.
In the middle of Murphy's round, he said that his office is planning a parliamentary trip that should take place this year and hopes that both sides and chambers will appear in the delegation.
The following days shall be published the names of the other legislators who are willing to engage.
He said he's still working on the program.
Although Murphy said that the aim of the road was to help make relations, he added that they would also be prepared to "be well-defined implementing measures".
He said that the European leaders must be honest with their own people when it comes to spying programs that they use for years themselves.
"While we are managing our monitoring programmes to better protect European rights, they also need to know that we are not the only one who is performing the spy here," Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr Kerry is measuring according to the plan for the Middle East and Poland to respond to the non-destruction that has already created American strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as American monitoring activities.
Australanca refused to stay in the Thai prison
A woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to fifteen-day prison on the island of Phuket, when she wrongly claimed that she was attacked by a taxi driver, called against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally accused by the country court on the island of Phuket of a criminal charge when the Thai police said that the taxi driver, along with two other men who had previously detained her, attacked her in the morning hours on Sunday 10 June.
However, the record from industrial television later disappeared that after she broke up with her Australian friend, she safely returned to her hotel.
The police from Phuket Island had a conversation with Bamford for two days before they found out you were thinking about the future.
Before the trial, she was held in the local police station.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-periphery facility in Phuket, instead of being placed in prison for adult women.
He is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who, in the case of his daughter, asked for help from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the entire family had "extreme concerns" about his daughter's fate and wanted her back to Australia.
"Of course this is a business period, but we hope that we will be back in safety the first time," Tunks said.
Bamford called against the verdict and was released at 50,000 bahts.
A report from Australia states that, in the meantime, she had a permit in the recreation area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The legal source in Thailand claims that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but it was given prior to warning that the appeal could lead to a court order that would increase its punishment and lead to prison for adults.
However, after the recent assassination of Australia's travel officer Michelle Smith of Phuket, Thailand can also try to create a shameful picture for tourists, which may just have become a free fight.
Jögre joked, "Do you want to get out of bed?

In addition, the uncle changed after a quick call.
Jaromír Jágr so curated against Tampæ in the middle of the night, on Thursday evening after 119. won in NHL, he commented on the social network Facebook.
"After watching this video, my agent Peter Freebod called the director of the Czech dragons and asked him if I should not be interested in advertising on their latest Pendolino train!" he wrote at the introduction with the superintendent Jágr.
We're kind of like ourselves first.
I'm probably gonna have to finish my night training so I don't get any more speed.
"I'm afraid that after that, the defense minister could call and want to make a press release."
New Jersey also signed a second victory in line.
"And most importantly, you've noticed that the treatment of Marie Rotttre is taking place," Jágr concluded.
Place of unladen light bulb
The river's volleyballs are more than winnings have brought down the bag of wounded.
These are not only the parties that have not received the messages (e.g. SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally also the ČSSD because of their internal dimension.
The politicians served us instead of Christmas candles for the weekend.
By the end of the day, the election had become the motto of Andrey Babies, who promised voters to change the existing political style of government.
The diversity of the voluntary outcome and the dispute on the winning side is political (and) for Mr. Miloše Earth, regardless of the wishes of the voters, who have publicly supported the country's president, nor have they chosen the parliamentary table.
The President of the Network has lost a strategic victory over other policies because of the unpleasant events, but he still has a number of ways to get it back - for example the election of the future prime minister.
While ČSSD has the chance to win a prime cross in my eyes, the businessmen of Andrej Babiš are getting closer.
The voluntary development is already a long and smooth development of the stable government for miles, but compared to the preliminary scenario of the left-wing government of the ČSSD supported by the communists, this development for business in the PRC and thus also for the economy is a better message.
In view of the votes of the ANO to be joined by ODS or TOP 09, the most likely variant of the ČSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL coalition is still the most likely option.
In view of the breakdown in the ČSSD, which has become an unreadable and weak party in the merger, the result of co-operation may be sufficient for ČSSD.
The minority government of ČSSD, which is composed of "non-nationals" in the City, will probably not go through.
In addition, any government to which the ČSSD will participate will be threatened by the unsatisfied ambitions of many social democracies, which can lead sooner or later to another division on the side.
So I ask myself, "Are we not going to another early elections?"
The next elections would be more of a referendum on the strength of the UN mandate.
The ČSSD plans for the implementation of sectoral taxes, the greater increase in revenue taxes or the construction of state banks have fallen below the table.
ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and Creativity are, however, consistent with business support, high fiscal policy (the government deficit below 3% of GDP), employment support for unemployed persons, lower VAT rates in the selected product.
The third areas are most available in view of the social policy and the size of the state.
However, the ANO has a proposal now, so the program is still the most likely ANO coalition, ČSSD, KDU-CHSL would be moving forward more quickly.
What I see is finally a better result than a left-wing program with the tax on all that is still moving in the economy.
