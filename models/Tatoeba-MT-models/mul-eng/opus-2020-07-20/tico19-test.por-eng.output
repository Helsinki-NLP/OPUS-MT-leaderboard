Cumulatively progressive outbreak of coronary disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronary disease cases (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that although it is at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and UTIs should prepare more for an outbreak of patients with COVID-19 who will need care and, above all, intensive treatment.
On 31 December 2019, a number of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention of China reported the cause agent as a new coronavirus, now referred to as Coronavirus 2 of the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from the infection by SARS-CoV-2 is called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence until now is that 80% of people with COVID-19 develop a mild form of disease, that is, a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolved into a more serious disease, demanding hospitalization, while 6% of the remaining cases evolved into a critical disease, demanding intensive treatment.
The mortality of patients hospitalised due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we evaluated the trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/Economic Space (EU/EEA) and in the United Kingdom and compared them to those of the Province of Hubei, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 was geographically spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
The issue of 5 March 2020 of Eurosurveillance, Spiteri et al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe, according to the WHO definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons who returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, the cases of COVID-19 have already been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and between 31 December 2019 and the date mentioned above, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths have been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths only in Italy.
Obtaining cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of cases reported by COVID-19 in each country in the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of the Countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, is updated every day at 8h.
These data were used to assess the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to compare them with Italy.
As an approach to the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases reported from each country until 15 March 2020 to 8h, and compared with Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The trends in the cumulative cumulative incidence of 14-day cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom in general followed those of the Hubei Province in China (Figure 1).
In general, for the EU/EEE and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and increased significantly thereafter around 28 February 2020 (complementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed similar increases in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It points out that by 15 March at 8 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases equipped with Italy for 3 weeks or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that pandemics are advancing at a similar rate in all countries.
This happens despite countries being at different stages, variations in the actions of the national public health systems and possibly different definitions of cases in countries and different protocols for the selection of patients who should be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including an update test.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive treatment, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive treatment units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on inhalation by cases of COVID-19 in a hospital and/or in an ITU are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (not shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to complement current surveillance data with focus in the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted between 2010 and 2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of ITU beds and semi-intensive units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal for every 100 thousand people.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12,5 ITU beds and semi-intensive treatment for a population of 100 thousand inhabitants between 2010 and 2011.
Modeled scenarios relating to the saturation of the capacity of the health system, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and for the United Kingdom of the prevalence of cases of hospitalization by COVID-19 associated with a 90 % risk of intensive treatment beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC’s rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Given that cases have so far been concentrated in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive treatment units generally meet a defined regional coverage population, information on cases and intensive treatment beds should be made available preferably in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
The example of Italy and trends in other countries shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and UTIs should therefore prepare for a sustained Community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who will need medical assistance, mainly intensive treatment, as is the case in the affected regions of Italy.
In accordance with the ECDC’s rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change in the content approach for a mitigation approach, since the rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide sufficient time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their actions adequately if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures for mitigating the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries can intensify their control initiatives to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce stress in the health system.
If these initiatives fail, the health systems of other EU/EEA countries are likely to have an outbreak of patients who will need intensive treatment in the coming days or weeks.
The disease of the 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the disease of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has already killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80 thousand in China and the rest of the world, resulting in a disaster for the population.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from the bites and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has less gravity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissible, and affects older than young people, and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article seeks to provide a current and comprehensive assessment of the research object, which is rapidly developing.
We will deal with basic principles of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this study helps to understand and eradicate this hostile disease.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 became a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were obliged to be confined to the whole wound and for several weeks thereafter due to the epidemic of a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was called SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease was called CV-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country and almost 50 other countries around the world.
By 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 recovered patients and more than 3,000 dead patients.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number one" and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nej.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months more than 200 articles were published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the virus isolated from several patients.
This article seeks to sum up the research progress in this new area of rapid development.
Whenever relevant, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and another disease caused by CoV, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, an epidemic of 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and forecasting of disease, as well as other urgent issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing about 15% of the common cold.
Meanwhile, in this century, we found two highly pathogenic human coVs, which are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing an epidemic originating in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and which were then spread to several other countries with morbidity and threatening mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third CV epidemic in the documented history of human being.
According to Figure 1.1, a portion of pneumonia cases with unknown origins was initially reported in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the sequence of the CV was published.
On 15 January 2020, Wuhan's first fatal case was reported.
In the meantime, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, the count of health professionals was communicated, suggesting that transmission among people was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was confined, with all its broken public transport.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that 41 patients with confirmed cases only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan sea fruit market, which was considered the beginning of the contagion by an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
Until the moment of this report, the disease has already spread across China and almost 50 other countries around the world (Fig.2).
As the situation gets worse quickly, the size and final severity of the epidemic should still be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a study of several centres with 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients confirmed with COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic, as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bbbdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, mainly in the age range of 30 to 65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected were over 50 years old, some were under 20 years old, and only 14 were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100) than women (0.27/100).
COVID-19 was proposed in groups, mainly in Hubei and around it.
COVID-19 received an average of 5 (2 to 9) days for diagnosis based on the appearance of symptoms.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
The mean bleeding time based on the appearance of symptoms was 9.5 (4.8-13 days).
The basic number of reproduction (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of people infected rose exponentially before 23 January 2020, corresponding to the mass transport time before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10% to 1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02% to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (masculin), age (more than 60 years old) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and encapsulated viruses containing a single RNA chain with a certain meaning.
They can be divided into four genders, namely: alpha, beta, gamma, and Delta, of which alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus are known to affect human beings.
The glycoprotein spike (S) of the envelope is connected to its cell receptors of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ECA2) and of the dipeptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and therefore the fusion of membranes occurs.
The viral RNA gene is released in cytoplasma; after the replication of the viral gene, the genomic RNA accompanied by glycoproteins encapsulated and nucleocapside proteins containing viruses, which bind to the plasma membrane and release the virus.
The first sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 gene was reported on 10 January 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 successive samples collected from the same source site, the Huanan Sea Fruit Market, in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the electronic transmission microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were discovered in ultrasound sections of the human airway epithelial.
It was found that the human ECA2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, S protein S of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ECA2 protein more fragile than SARS-CoV protein, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secret protein encoded by orf8.
The ORF3b of SARS-CoV-2 may perform a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNb; however, the Orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional reason.
On 18 February 2020 Zhou, et al., reported the ECA2 human crea-EM structure of a total of 2.9 Å resolution in a complex with the B0AT1 amino acid carrier.
It was found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was grouped as a diameter, and the ECA2-B0AT1 complex can combine two S proteins, which provides evidence for the recognition and infection of CV.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for the selection of medicines to remove the infection by SARS-CoV-2.
The host of origin and the intermediary
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were born of humans and were transmitted to human beings through wires and cables, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, the males were considered the native hosts of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to two coVs of SARS-so-called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host who helped the virus cross the species barrier and infect human beings remains unknown, and the transmission route still needs to be discovered.
Ji, et al., suggests that copper carries the virus of the molluscs for human beings, which involved a homologous recombination in protein S.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins, long-term fochiny mammals that are used frequently in traditional Chinese medicine are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on genetic homology of 99% between a coV discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1% in two genes is a big difference; therefore, final results for concrete evidence are expected (Figure 33).
The physical-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are mostly unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days below 20 °C with a moisture content of 40% to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 can have similar properties.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ester, ethanol 75%, disinfectant with chlorine, peracetic acid, chloroformium and other organic solvents, but not chlorethidine, are effective in deactivating the virus.
In general, all the human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study was reported in relation to immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only look at previous studies on other CoVs, mainly on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig.4.4).
In general, after a virus invasive of the host, it is first recognised by the host's immune system by means of standard recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, Toll type receptor (TLR), NOD type receptor (NLR) and RIG-I type receptor (RLR).
By different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the matured dendritic cells and the synthesis of interferons of type I (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the fagocytosis of macrophages of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV protein N may help the virus to escape immune responses.
In a short time, the immune response is linked to the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including T CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in the defence.
T CD4+ cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and T CD8+ cells kill directly the cells infected by the virus.
Collaborative T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, the CV may inhibit the functions of the T cells by inducing the apoptosis of the T cells.
Humor immunity, including supplements such as C3a and C5a antibodies, is also essential for combating viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system generates a large number of local free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, worse than the hypotheses, multiple failure of the organs, and even death.
The infection by SARS-CoV-2, characterized by the appearance of symptoms in a group of people, affects older people with condomorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is compromised to have a greater chance of being infected than other people.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days and, in most cases, from 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days, on average, and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days, based on the demographic of 8.866 cases.
It is essential that the health authorities adjust the effective time of quarantine based on the most precise period of incubation, thus preventing infected people who do not have symptoms transmit the virus to others.
As current practice, individuals exposed to or infected by the virus usually have to stay in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended for 24 days?
Fever is usually the initial and main symptom of COVID-19, which can come alone or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, lack of air, muscle pain, vertigo, headache, throat pain, erythema, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnea and/or hypoxaemia a week after the symptoms of the disease appeared.
In serious cases, patients rapidly evolved for acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory and acute fever symptoms, even without abnormality in the diagnosis by the lung image, should undergo treatment for the virus in order to receive an early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea and 3% for diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
Similar results have been reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group that transmits an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as major symptoms.
However, 80% of patients needed ventilator support, much more than COVID-19 patients, which consists of the greater mortality of MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MIRS.
In patients with SARS, fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnea (40% to 42%), diarrhoea (20% to 25%) and throat pain (13% to 25%) were the main symptoms, and ventilator support was needed for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
Until 14 February, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2%, when the cases confirmed in the world reached 66,576.
Similarly, the mortality of SARS by November 2002 was 10% of 8.096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A more recent study reported that the baseline number R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was up to 6.47 with a confidence interval (IC) of 95%, 5.71 to 7.23 while the R0 of SARS-CoV varied from 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in relation to its symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The figures above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, it is a much greater challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV.
The appearance of symptoms in a group of people usually occurs in the same family or in the same agglomeration or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually provide history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact individuals or patients infected in the previous two weeks with symptoms.
However, it was reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without symptoms, and patients treated who received high hospital leave can reverse the virus again, which generates an alarm to prolong the time of quarantine.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of white blood cells (mainly lymphocytes) at the initial stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white globulin count below 4 x 109/L including lymphocyte count less than 1 x 109/L, and high levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were detected in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of enzymes and myoglobins in the muscles and liver were increased in the blood of some patients, and the C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, demero-D levels, a product of fibrine degradation present in the blood was high, and lymphocyte count was progressive reduction.
Abnormalities in torax radiographics are present in most patients with COVID-19, and present abnormal bilateral shadows or opacity in the lungs.
Patients generally developed an atypical pneumonia, acute damage to the lungs and acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (SDRA).
When SDRA occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise the gas exchange.
The dysfunction of type-I and type-II pneumatics decreases the surface level and increases the pressure, thus reducing the lung capacity, and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapsing.
Therefore, the most serious results of torax radiography generally correspond to the most serious form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the decommissioning of pneumatics, the formation of hyalin membranes, the infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes and sinic cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and SDRA, and similar to the pathology of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reaction in the polymerase chain – reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of negative errors, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which occurred not only from RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological results is essential and indispensable to achieving an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for the use of the SHERLOCK technique based on CRISPR to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic RNA fragments from SARS-CoV-2 in 20 x 10-18 mol/L to 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per microlitre of input) using a range of measurement in less than one hour without the need for a complex instrumentation.
We hope that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience, if checked in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new CV, doctors may provide, in the best of their ability, palliative treatment for patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of treatments used or previously proposed for the treatment of other CVs such as SARS-CoV and METS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of patients treated, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of patients recovered was suggested as treatment.
The pharmaceutical companies are running against time to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the beginning and probably also attacks at a lower degree other organs with ECA2 expression, such as the gastrointestinal system and the rins.
However, respiratory dysfunction and organ failure are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve the symptoms and save lives, including general oxygenation therapy, high flow oxygenation, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to receive extra body membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified alternative cardiopulmonary alternative technique used for the treatment of severe heart failure or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolytic balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of the functions of vital organs are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that cytokine cassate results from the excessive reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine cassate is a systemic inflammatory response characterised by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IFN, IFNβ, IFNg, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce the immune system's cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and multiple failure of organs.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine cascats, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, are being used to treat cytokine cassate.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine cassate include modulation of the immune response to T cells; the blockage of IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF; the inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab; the removal of cytokines 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressors, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses steroids were not beneficial for severe pulmonary lesion in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
They can cause serious side effects, mainly osteoencrosis, affecting dramatically the prognosis.
However, short-term short-term treatment with corticosteroids in low-moderate doses was recommended for careful use in patients with COVID-19 severely ill.
At the time this article was written, no effective antiviral therapy was confirmed.
However, intravenous administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdecivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, initially intended for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other simple fita RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
On this basis, Gilead provided the composition for China to perform some tests in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are very expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were suggested as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interaction with other drugs used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma of patients treated and generation of antibodies
The blood collection of patients who have been treated with a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect healthy individuals from contracting the disease has a long history.
In fact, patients treated generally have a relatively high level of antibodies in the blood against pathogen.
Anticorpos are an immunoglobulin (lg) produced by lymphocytes B to fight pathogens and other strange bodies, and they recognize unique molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients treated with COVID-19 and was injected in 10 patients in severe condition.
Its symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral loads, and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and elucidation are necessary in order to propose the use of the method on a large scale before the development of specific therapies.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related disadvantages should be considered cautiously.
Antibodys, for example, may overstimulate immune response and cause cytokines release syndrome, which is potentially fatal toxicity.
Concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and plasma demand is great to treat patients in severe condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies with sufficient speed to fight an epidemic of global proportions.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate the B cells of patients treated and identify the genetic codes that code effective antibodies or make a choice for effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
Thus, we can rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
Chinese Traditional Medicine, MTC, is used thousands of years ago to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend heavily on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to diagnosis of a disease based on MTC theories.
Most effective components remain unknown, or empty, as it is difficult to extract and verify these components or their best combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective therapy for COVID-19, MTC has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with braided or moderate symptoms, or for patients who recovered from severe stages of the disease.
For example, it was found that Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The best treatment rates for patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces in China who used MTC in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while the Province of Hubei, who used MTC in only about 30% of patients with COVID-19, received the lower treatment rate (13%).
However, this is a difficult comparison, since many impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a comparative study between the exclusive treatment with the western medicine and the combined treatment of the western medicine with the MTC.
It was found that the time needed for recovery of body temperature, for the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were significantly lower in the group treated with Western medicine and MTC than in the group treated with western medicine only.
The lower rate of symptoms (from severe brands) was significantly lower for the treatment group treated by Western medicine and MTC than for the treatment group only (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the treatment group than in the Western medicine and MTC treated group only (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the MTC still wait for more duly controlled tests on larger and more centres.
It would also be useful to characterize the mechanisms of action and to explain the effective components of the treatment of the MTC or its combinations, if possible.
Patients confirmed with COVID-19 or suspected of the disease feel, in general, a great fear of highly contagious disease that can be fatal, and people in Querentane also feel confused, lonely and irritated.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and toss, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as corticosteroids, may increase anxiety and psychological suffering.
In the initial phase of the SARS epidemic, several psychiatric morbidities, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychometric excitement, symptoms of psychosis, deliriousness and even suicidal tendencies, were reported.
The tracking of contacts and mandatory quarantine, as part of the public health system's actions against the COVID-19 epidemic, can make people more anxious, and they may feel guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and the stigma imposed on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to those who suspected the disease and to those who had contacted them, as well as to the general population, who needed it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and on treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential for interrupting the transmission chain of animals and people infected with pathogens, and are generally complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
Initiatives were taken to develop proteins based on protein S to generate powerful and durable neutralizer antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo effectiveness of these vaccine candidates in older individuals and the models of lethal challenge and their protection against infection by zoonotic viruses still need to be determined before the start of a clinical study.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since then.
On the other hand, the sporadic and focus of the MERS continues to occur in the Middle East and to spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in the endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies were developed for MERS using inactive viruses, DNA plasma, viral vectors, nanoparticulates, similar particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and essential task for the control of the current epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome the difficulty, due to the long period (18 months, average) needed for the development of a vaccine and changes in the dynamics of the CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical evolution, reaching thousands of patients.
In most cases patients recovered gradually without delay.
However, in the same way as SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with serious cases.
Therefore, building a prognosis model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritise their services, especially in areas with lack of resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported up to now, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: age was the most important factor for SARS prognostic, which is also valid for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects people between 30 and 65 years of age, with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age, in a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive treatment had greater opportunities to present underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older than patients who did not need intensive treatment (meaning 66 years versus 51 years of age), suggesting that age is a prognosis factor for the health benefit of patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 men and 0.27/100 women), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who need intensive treatment are more likely to suffer from acute heart disease or arrhythmia.
Cardiac episodes were the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also combine positive ECA2 collacos, which may lead to liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is important to note that age and underlying diseases have a strong correlation and can interfere with each other.
abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and was proposed as a potential prognosis factor for the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
The correlation of the CRP level with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and elevated creatinine quinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are expressly present in several organs, mainly in the heart and liver, and are released during the injury to the tissue.
Therefore, they are traditional markers for cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: torax radiographics and the progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other issues for predicting COVID-19 outcomes/complications.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are commonly used immunosuppressors as additional therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Given that a high dose of corticosteroids was widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, with permanent incapacity and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in a low dose and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: as described above, during the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients experience high stress, as they spend long periods of quarantine and uncertainty, and witness the death of loved members of the family and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychological advice and sustained support to help these patients recover from stress and restore a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological characteristics of SARS.
In addition to replication in lower respiratory treatment, SARS-CoV-2 is able to react effectively in higher respiratory treatment and does not cause symptoms in the initial phase of infection (or cause only mild symptoms), similar to other coVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in the initial phase or period of incubation may produce a large amount of virus during their daily activities, causing a great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV transmission occurs when patients are severely ill, with most transmissions not occurring in the initial phase.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS epidemic.
Great efforts are being made in China today, including the bordering of Wuhan and neighboring cities, and the continued quarantine of almost all the population, in the hope of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have had a dramatic impact on the country's economy and other sectors, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the remission of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic ends by March, and the phase of deceleration lasts between 3 and 4 months.
However, other specialists are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., considered that the COVID-19, which seems to be substantially more infectious than the SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., set up a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may infect two thirds of the world's population.
A group of Canadians reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the outbreaks of the throat and the mean cancer of patients who recovered and received high hospital in the previous 2 weeks, indicating that the new identified virus can become a cyclic episode similar to the influenza.
However, promising indicators took place in China on the basis of the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
It was originally expected that Ebola would cause up to a million cases, with half a million deaths.
However, with the quarantine and rigid isolation, the disease was kept under control, at the end.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, in the same way as SARS-CoV, may become weaker than its infectivity and, at some point, become a less pathogenic virus co-existing with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is found below (Fig. (Fig.55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by cough and breath and, possibly, by direct contact with substances contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in phases, which creates a new possibility: oral-female transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by noccomomy infections, including 17 patients with underlying diseases and 40 health professionals.
Therefore, greater caution should be taken to protect people, especially health professionals, social workers, family members, colleagues and people with direct contact with patients or infected individuals.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (series No. 1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
surgical facial masks prevent fluids from being transported into the air or being attached to the surfaces of the objects, where they can infect other people.
However, only the N95 masks (series No. 1860s) protect against inhalation of viruses of 10 nm to 80 nm, with only 5% of the viruses being able to penetrate them completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, and they have approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five single surgical masks, healthcare professionals directly contact patients should use N95 masks (series No. 1860s), but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals should use isolation clothes to further reduce contact with the virus.
The viruses also infected an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected by SARS-CoV-2, although he was using a N95 mask; the virus could have entered his body through his eyes infected.
Health professionals should therefore also use transparent facial protection or protective eyes when caring for patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that all wash hands with disinfectant soap more often than normal, try to stay home in isolation and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A metre is considered an adequate distance to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection, as well as to prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new virus for human beings, its high approval to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have caused a great warning to China, based on its recent history with the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, only on 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Centre calmed the citizens, saying that the new virus has a low rate of contagion and reproducibility among humans, and that it was not difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message left the most relaxed people, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical period for the disease in Wuhan on a minimum scale was lost.
Disease control agencies in China can take advantage of this tough lesson and make crucial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should: (1) be more careful when making public statements, as everything they say is absorbed by the citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to the inconsistencies from hospitals instead of waiting for formal communications from doctors and authorities; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic at their initial stage instead of trying to comfort the public; and (4) to issue more often effective guidance simulations to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to test and improve the social response system periodically.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it spread throughout China and almost 50 other countries around the world, at the time of writing of this text.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic generated a return sensation from SARS.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the maintenance of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older than young people, and more men than women, and severity and mortality rates are also higher in older than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus when they do not have symptoms, while patients with SARS usually transmit it when they are severely ill, making it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in part because SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and affects regions more than SARS-CoV.
The regular RNA trial for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, patients treated may receive a positive test for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of spread of the virus.
Given the rapid progress in the COVID-19 research, several crucial issues still need to be resolved, as follows:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homologous has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two CoVs of snakes similar to SARS, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 has origin in cats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, from the bear, let's say, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions Nos 1 and 2, we cannot cut transmission efficiently, and the epidemic may have a recurrence at any time.
Although molecular modelling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 connects to ECA2, how exactly does the virus enter into the respiratory tract cells and causes subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also connected to ECA2 cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus developing genetically during transmission between human beings?
Will it become a global pandemic, disappear like SARS or have seasonal recurrences, like flu?
It is essential, but it may take some time to find answers to the above questions and to so many others.
However, regardless of the effort required, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Soybeans of human coronavirus
The mutation and adaptation have stimulated the evolution of coronavirus (CoVs) and its hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, it was known that two human coVs (HcoVs) caused a brand disease, such as a common cold.
The epidemics of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS) changed what was thought of the CoVs and revealed how lethal HCoV infection could be.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 in central China by the end of 2019 has again highlighted the CVS and surprised everyone with their high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to their SARS-CoV brother.
HCoV infection is zoonotic, and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs is enormously useful.
Most of the HCoVs originated from the ants, in which they are not pathogenic.
The intermediate reserve hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in human beings.
The investigation of the interactions of the host of the CV in animals can also provide important information on the pathogens of the CV in humans.
In this study, we present a general view of the information available on the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and interesting transmission.
An important analysis is that we compare and contrast between different HCoVs from a perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current disease epidemic by CV 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
Furthermore, the requirements for effective transition between the host and the implications of the evolution of the virus in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a group of encapsulated viruses, positive polarity and simple fita RNA.
These viruses presenting the largest genome, between 26 and 32 kilobases, between RNA viruses were called "CoVs" due to their coro-morphology when observed in electronic microscopy.
As for the structure, the CVs have non-separated genes that share a similar organisation.
About two thirds of the genome contain two open-label reading structures (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into polyproteins of Replicase pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are re-converted and generate 16 non-structured proteins called nsp1 to nsp16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Some specific line accessory proteins are also codified by different lines of CoVs.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified in four genes (alphaCoV, betaCoV, gammaCoV and DeltaCoV), among which the betaCoV gene contains the majority of HCoVs and is subdivided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Philogenetic evidence showed that mammals and rodents serve as a genetic source for most alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gammaCoVs and DeltaCoVs.
For thousands of years, the CoVs have constantly crossed species' barriers, and some have become relevant human pathogens.
Until now, seven human coVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphaCoVs.
The other five betaCoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-COV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 generally cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold and/or diarrhoea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe respiratory tract infection below a relatively higher number of patients, with a high chance of developing acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (SDRA) and extrapulmonary events.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the course of patients with common cold in the mid- 1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through extensive studies on HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, and both cause autolimitation symptoms.
In fact, the concept that HCoV infection is generally non-violence was widely accepted until the SARS epidemic.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating of the current and infected more than 8,000 people, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the epidemic of the respiratory syndrome in the Middle East (MERS) resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arab Peninsula, with sporadic propaganda for the rest of the world.
The new 2019 HCOV (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the agent responsible for the current disease epidemic of the 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which took more than 3.120 lives and infected more than 91 thousand people until 3 March 2020.
The alarm is ringing, and the world needs to prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that is coming.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origins in mammals, mammals or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence corroded with the evolutionary origin of all HCVs from mice, where viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic, but demonstrate a great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic presents enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and for the rest of the world.
The tracking of the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a structure to understand the natural history, the incentive force and the restrictive factors of the migration of viruses to other species.
This can also guide and facilitate the search by the reserve host, intermediate and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for the future prevention of viral migration between species.
In this article, we present a general vision of zoonotic origins, of the interferenceal transmission and pathogenicity of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that the parent viruses of HCoVs are usually not pathogenic in their natural reservations, but they become pathogenic after the transmission of interest to a new host.
We have also reviewed the trend towards the evolution of HCoV, in which the increase in transmissibility is generally accompanied by the decrease in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the end of the 1930s.
Prior to the first insulation of HCV-229E skin B814 from the treatment of patients with common cooling, different CoVs had been isolated in several infected animals, including peru, camundgo, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of HCoV discovery history in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and informative.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory treatment of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was subsequently adapted to growth in pulmonary cells WI-38.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had common cold symptoms, including headache, breath, malaise, and throat pain, with fever and cough present in 10% to 20% of cases.
Subsequently, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the culture of organs and subsequent serial passage in vertebrates during lactation.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomaticly differential of the infection by other pathogens of the respiratory tract, such as influenza A and rinovirus virus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, and are intended to be transmitted mainly during the winter season in temperatures.
In general, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, accompanied by the disease for about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy individuals infected by HCoV-229E developed a common cold brand.
Only some immunocompressed patients experienced severe infections of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first documented pandemic caused by HCoV in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third discovered HCoV.
The first case of SARS is re-examined in 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths, spreading by several countries and continents.
With the exception of "superspasing", it was estimated that each infected person can pollute approximately two others, with a period of 4 to 7 days incubation, and with the presence of the viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience headache, headache, fever, malaise and calafries followed by subsequent symptoms of dyspnea, cough and respiratory discomfort.
Linfopenia, hepatic dysfunction and high creatinine kinase are the common abnormalities of SARS in laboratory tests.
In patients with SARS, the spread of epithelial cells and the increase in macrophages are also observed.
Approximately 20% to 30% of patients need, at some point, intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory treatment, several organs, including gastrointestinal treatment, liver and kidney, may also be affected in these serious cases, usually with a cytokine cassette, which may be fatal, mainly in immunocompressed patients.
The virus was first isolated in a lung biopsy of a parent of a zero patient traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
It was initially discovered that the virus was prevalent in small children, elderly and immunocompressed patients with respiratory diseases.
The symptoms of heart, conjunctivitis, fever and bronquiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus of a nasal species of an 8-month baby suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is scattered all over the world.
It was estimated that HCoV-NL63 corresponds to approximately 4.7% of the common respiratory diseases, and its incidence of peaks occurs in winter, spring and early summer.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with the obstructive laryngitis, also known as a rupee.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronquiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to the pneumonia and bronquiolitis acquired in Community way, it was reported that HCoV-HKU1 was associated with acute asthma exacerbation.
In the same way that HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide, causing branded respiratory diseases.
All these four HCOVs acquired in a community way were well adapted to human beings and generally have less chance of suffering mutation and causing highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for a rare reason in the case of a more virile subtype of HCOV-NL63, which has recently been reported as a major cause of lower respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to be effectively transmitted and to remain in human beings, they also become less virulent and less pathogenic.
The MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most of the cases confirmed by the laboratory are originating in the Middle East, cases imported with occasional secondary promotion for close contacts were reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary epidemic took place in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute renal insufficiency, which is therefore well peculiar to MERS, among the diseases caused by HCOV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
By 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases by laboratory were reported with a high mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 34.4%, which has become one of the most devastating viruses known to man.
Since the end of December 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia, who were known retrospectively to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the continuing epidemic of respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Importance and also named the COVID-19 disease.
Up to 3 March 2020, 90.053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 3.4%.
It is noted that loyalty related to confirmed cases in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while loyalty outside this city is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, as well as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with presence of fever, cough and dyspnea.
Some patients also have diarrhoea.
The pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly develop to the syndrome of acute respiratory discomfort.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to high homology of 82% in the nucleotide sequence, they are grouped into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic, but it is more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 were reported, and they can contribute to the rapid spread of the virus in the world.
The comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveals similarities and differences of great relevance.
Firstly, the period of incubation and the duration of the evolution of HCV disease are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is found between the severity of SARS-CoV and the severity of the four HCoVs purchased Community-wide (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the infection by SARS-CoV-2 presents characteristics that are more observed during the infection with HCoVs acquired in a Community way, including the presence of non-specific symptoms, brands or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of serious cases of COVID-19 can also be observed, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly smaller.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting standards, both in the HCoVs purchased Communityly and in the SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as those of HCoVs acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it should be confirmed whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing to human beings, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, in the same way that the other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fake samples.
It is still necessary to be clarified in future studies if the golden-fecial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, such as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances.
It is also of great interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 can show seasonality, as in the cases of HCoVs acquired in a Community way.
Anyway, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after their passage to human beings, will influence the outcome of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All HCoVs acquired in a community way that causes brand symptoms have adapted well to human beings.
In another perspective, it can also be true that human beings have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, the two could be the survivors of old HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause serious human diseases and people who develop serious HCoVs have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCVs need to re-apply in human beings to a sufficient extent in order to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize the factors of restriction.
In this sense, the longer the duration of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, the more people will be infected, and the greater the chance that the virus will adapt to human beings.
If adaptation is appropriate, its transmission to human beings would be difficult to control with quarantine or other infection control measures.
A number of years ago, the four acquired Community-wide CoVs were around the human population, causing common cold in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses don't need an animal reserve.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, highly pathogenic, did not adapt well to human beings, and their transmission between human beings cannot be supported.
They need to keep and spread in their zootic reservoirs and take the chance to migrate to subsequent human destinations, possibly through one or more intermediate host and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and four HCoVs purchased in Community way.
It is highly transmissible, in the same way that HCoVs are acquired in a Community way, at least up to now.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoVs purchased in a Community way and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It still needs to be discovered if it will be fully adapted to human beings and will travel between us without a reserve animal or intermediate host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutional, natural, reserve, intermediate and amplifiers of HCVs.
An animal serves as the evolutional host of a HCoV if it covers a direct relationship antistral, sharing high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
Antistral virus is generally well adapted and not pathogenic in this host.
In the same way, a reserve host covers the HCoV continuously and permanently.
In both cases, hosters are infected naturally and are the natural hosts of HCV or their parental virus.
On the other hand, if HCOV is recently injected to an intermediate host immediately before or near its introduction to human beings, it does not adapt adequately to the new host, and is usually pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and perform the function of an amplifier host, allowing the virus to respond in a transparent manner and then transmit it to humans and increase the scale of human infection.
A HCoV may have the interrupting infection if it cannot support its transmission to the intermediate host.
In contrast, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and establish a long-term index.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reserve host.
Epidemiological data revealed that the SARS zero patient had a history of contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent studies of soroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of IgG antiSARS-CoV compared to the general population.
Masked palm trees (Larvata Pamuma) and a cane-gasin in live animals markets were initially identified as carrying viruses similar to SARS-CoV.
The identification was confirmed directly by the fact that no other SARS was notified after the collapse of all civilians on the market.
However, it was reported that wild or wild feral palm beads were highly negative for SARS-CoV markets, suggesting that mastic palm bees could only be the amplifier intermediate host, but not the natural reserve of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that 80% of the different animals on the market in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies; the possibility that various species of small mammals can serve as amplifier intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
All these animals seem to be terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
The subsequent search by the SARS-CoV's natural animal host revealed a CV of a close relationship worm named CoV HKU3 of a Rhinolophus-related insect associated with the SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese ferredura.
These molluscs are positive for antiSARS-CoV antibodies and for the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other coVs of molluscs share 88% to 92% of homologies with SARS-CoV in the nucleotide sequence.
These studies have formed the basis for the new concept that infants are the host of emerging human pathogens.
Several CoVs similar to SARS (SL-CoVs) were also identified in mice, but no CoV, with the exception of the designated WIV1, may be isolated as live virus.
It is known that angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ECA2) from human beings is the SARS-CoV receptor.
It has been shown that the WIV1 derived from feces fake samples uses ECA2 of pigs, bovines and human beings as a receptor for entering the cells.
It is interesting that the sarcoidosis of patients with SARS was able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, the WIV1 represents the antistral with a closer relationship to SARS-CoV in mice, sharing 95% of homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that the WIV1 is not the immediately parental virus of SARS-CoV, and that the pigs are not the immediate reserve hosts of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis groupes the MERS-CoV in the same group as the CV-HKU4 and the CV-HKU5 in the molluscs.
CoV-HKU4 of pigs and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidil-peptidase 4 (DPP4), to enter the virus.
Polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA sequences are philogenetically closer to betaCoV homologies identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild dogs.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the CoV-HKU25 of the pigs, only 87% of the homologous in the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, cats may not be the immediate reserve host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that thromedians are soro-positive for specific neutralization antibodies of the MERS-CoV, the same as Middle East camels in several African countries.
The live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in human beings, was isolated from nasal outbreaks of rumeders, increasing the evidence that camels serve as the legitimate reserve host of the MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that the symptoms are generally braded, but with massive transmission of the virus, were observed in experimentally infected camels with MERS-CoV.
It is remarkable that infected camels transmit the viruses not only by breathing route but also by fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of transmission of viruses in mice.
However, there are still no answers, since many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the appearance of symptoms, which may be assigned to transmission between persons or transmission routes involving unidentified animal species covering the MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of nucleotide homology with a CoV RATG13 of molluscs, isolated from Rhinolophus afinis.
As in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, the difference in the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is very large to assign a parental relationship.
In other words, the ants may not be the immediate reserve hosts of SARS-CoV-2, unless CoVs are almost identical to the ants are discovered in the future.
It is assumed that SARS-CoV-2's intermediate pets should be set up among wild species sold and slaughtered in the Huanan Marine Fruits Market, in which many of the early cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a likely animal transmission event to human beings.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing suggested that a group of small threatened breast-feeding mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also cover betaCoVs anti-SARS-CoV-2.
These new genera of pangolim coves share 85% to 92% of homology in the nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also, in the same way, directly related to RATG13, with approximately 90% of identity at the level of nucleotide sequence.
They are grouped in sublinhagens of viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a domain of link to the receptor (DLR) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% identity in the amino acid sequence.
In a huge contrast, the DLRs of SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 are more divergent, although they present a high degree of sequential homology throughout the genome.
A recent study on pangolins also reported the detection of viral consensus sequences of lung samples, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different configuration and manual healing methods to generate a partial genomic sequence, corresponding to approximately 86.3% of the viral gene in total size.
We cannot exclude the possibility of pangolim being one of SARS-CoV-2's intermediate pets.
However, there is currently no evidence to confirm the direct origin of the pangolim SARS-CoV-2 due to the divergence in the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 of the pangolins.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 is even smaller than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 of the Pangolins.
The evolutional path of SARS-CoV-2 in dogs, pangolins and other mammals still needs to be clarified.
While higher sequential homology was found in the DLRs between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolim, betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 shared the broader genomic sequential homogenetic homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the betaCoVs DLRs of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is due to the convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counter-argument relates to the combination of betaCoV of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As an incentive force in evolution, the combination is quite present in betaCoVs.
The zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains in research.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have been derived from breast-feeding coVs, while parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were detected in rats.
It was reported that an ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in the North American tricolor worm was directly related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another breast-feeding CV, called Hippos/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and it is also suspected that camel camels are their intermediate hosts.
For more clarity, the current knowledge of known HCoV animal origins is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis provided evidence for interesting transmission events of HCoVs throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species and infected human beings from domestic animals around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was registered.
The history of interfering transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
AlphaCoVs of severely related HCoV-229E were detected.
Among them, there's an alphaCoV of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence corroded the direct transmission of the virus for humans.
First, human beings, but not alpines, can have contact with the ants in a shared ecological nest.
In contrast, human beings have direct contact with the alpines.
Second, alphaCoVs of mice related to HCoV-229E are different and not pathogenic in mice, while alphaCoV of alpacas caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alphaCoV of alpacas was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas from human beings obtain alphaCoV related to HCoV-229E.
In fact, mammals are the direct source of pathogenic viruses for human beings, including the virus of anger, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus and the Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that ants transmit HCoV-229E directly to human beings.
As an alternative, while alphaCoVs serve as the genetic pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dramedians can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to human beings, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of an interesting transmission of dragons for dragons and dragons for human beings.
The evolutional origin of the MERS-CoV from the ants is known in its initial identification and was corroded by subsequent results.
It is obvious that the ants provide a rich pool of viral species for the exchange of interest of genetic fragments and the transmission of interest.
Longevity, colonies with high density, strict social interaction and high flight capacity are all favourable conditions for cats to be the ideal "viral propeller".
On the other hand, the introduction of MERS-CoV into the pipelines goes back to decades.
He is well adapted to these camels, and migrated from an intermediate host to a natural and stable reserve host.
MERS-CoV is the cause of a well-branded disease and supports a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to human beings is an accident, and human beings remain terminal hosts of MERS-CoV, as their transmission cannot be supported.
Contrary to the role of the camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, is different.
In particular, the betaCoVs of pangolins are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be a terminal host for betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, similar to the civilians, in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for the interesting transmission of SARS-CoV-2 animals for human beings need to be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, the pigs could be the reserve host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Human beings could share the ecological nest with the dragonflies by means of abaceous or coal mines.
Secondly, the pangolins could be one of the amplifier intermediate hosts, in which a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 had recently been infected.
Human beings contract the virus through slaughter and consumption of hunting meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A study on antibodies produced from domestic animals and wild animals is necessary.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the combination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has both contact with both the mammals and the pangolins.
The search for SARS-CoV-2 animal origins is still active.
In addition to the different types of animal host, three main factors in the virus are important in facilitating the spread of species by the CoVs.
First, its rate of relatively high mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other simple flat-rate RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of the CVs can be considered as "moderate" to "high" with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year, locally, depending on the adaptation phase of the CV to the new hosts.
The CoVs have exorribonuclease with review mechanism, whose exclusion results in extremely high mutation and atenuation, or even invisibility.
It is interesting that the nucleotide analogue replication of the CV by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase.
Remdecivir is one of the most promising antiSARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the exchange rates of the CoVs are nearly a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of change is generally high when the CoVs are not properly adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is low, apparently, which suggests its higher level of adaptation to human beings.
It is assumed that he has already adapted to another guest who keeps in touch with human beings.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to the wires.
theoretically, it is unlikely that a genetic change would soon make the vaccines and antivirals in opposition to SARS-CoV-2.
Secondly, the large gene of the RNA in CoVs performs an extra plasticity in the modification of the gene for mutations and combinations, thus increasing the likelihood of interesting evolution, which is beneficial for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions become appropriate.
This is reinforced by the abundance of single reading frames and coded protein functions in relation to the last three segments of the genome.
Thirdly, the CoVs exchange random and frequent models during the replication of RNA through a single "copy selection" mechanism.
In a host who serves as a blender, the exchange of fats occurs frequently during the transmission of the CV RNA.
Long high homologous and subgenomial RNAs can be combined to generate new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found both in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs, such as the SL-COV of the pigs and the BatCoV-HKU9.
Hospital virus interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the viral interaction with the host receiver is another key factor that influences the transmission of interest.
Here, the combination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of the positive selection during relevant transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between SARS-CoV isolates of human and civilian beings, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes a rapid adaptation to different hosts, mainly with mutations in the DLR of protein S.
In general, DLR in a CV protein interacts with the cell receptor and is carefully selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, DLR is in amino acids 318o to 510o in the S1 fragment, which is linked to ECA2 human, as well as its receptors for viral input.
SARS-CoV DLR is capable of identifying the ECA2 receptors of several animals, including cats, civets, camdongos and caes-gaxins, enabling the virus's interesting transmission.
In fact, it was observed that only six amino acid residues were different from human viral isolates and bovine animals in the DLR, and four of them were located on the ground of contact with the receptor for interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
The SARS-COV of the tissues has K479N and S487T mutations in their DLR, which could increase the affinity of protein spike interaction with the human ECA2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be critical for viral adaptation in human beings.
Please note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in unit S1 of protein S implies that the affinity of binding of your S protein to human ECA2 may have been altered.
In fact, a study with electronic chriomicroscopy indicates an affinity of 10 to 20 times greater than the human ECA2 and SARS-CoV protein.
It will also be useful to determine whether any other rectifier may be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It is interesting that HCoV-NL63 also connects to ECA2, but with a different part of protein S.
There are several other HCV receptors, such as aminopeptide N for HCV-229E and silic acid 9-O-acetylated for HCV-OC43.
They could also respond to the effective adaptation of these CoVs in human beings after the interesting transmission of their animal hosts.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of the interfering transmission of HCoVs is also controlled by other factors of restriction and dependence with the host.
The divergence of these host proteins between human beings and HCoV's natural reserve hosts such as ants, rhomedians and rotors could be a barrier to the transmission of interest.
HCoVs need to use the dependant factors with the host and subversive the host restriction factors for an effective and effective transmission.
In this sense, molecular determinants in this important area of the virus-hosteder interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
A non-intended selection with the extent to which the host depends on the genome and restrict factors for SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR's modern technology can yield good results.
New HCoVs Introduction: return to zero stack
The diversity of the CVs of ants provides wide possibilities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, the coVs of ants serve as a genetic pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid genetic mutation and recombination also stimulate the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein codification genes has the potential to radically modify viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV's additional proteins, it is believed that the ORF8 is important in its adaptation to human beings, since the cancer virus related to SARS-CoV was isolated, but it was found that they codify different ORF8 proteins.
A feature of the exclusion of the 29 SARS-CoVs nucleotide was discovered in isolated tissues at the beginning of the human epidemic.
The exclusion divides the ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the alternateness of guests.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible historical combination with alphaCoVs and gammaCoVs lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
In the same way, it was demonstrated that the epidemiological MERS-COV has undergone combination events between different lines, which took place in roads in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events were also observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs combined with other animal CoVs in their non-structured species.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genes, likely resulting from the relief of the selection pressure exercised on the viruses, such as the pressure of the host's immune system.
One example of these effects is the loss of a long ORF4 in the prototype of HCoV-229E due to the exclusion of two nucleotides.
While the ORF4 intact can be observed in male and female viruses related to HCoV-229E, alphaCoV of alpacas presents a simple insertion of nucleotide, resulting in a change in the tables.
Finally, but no less important, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by the selection pressure in its reserve hosts.
Absence of symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected in mice when they were infected with CoVs, indicating the mutual adaptation between CoVs and mice.
It is likely that the ants are well adapted to the anatomical and physiological CoVs.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflamatory response in mice effectively reduce the pathology developed by the CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural terminal cells in mice is removed due to the adaptation of the inhibitor receptor of natural exterminating cells NKG2/CD94, and the low degree of expression of Class I molecules of the main Histocompatibilities complex.
Moreover, the high level of reactive species of oxygen (ERO) generated from the high metabolic activity of the molluscs can remove the replication of the CV as to affect the review by exorribonuclease, thus providing selective pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CV could also evolve by combination, leading to the acquisition of new protein or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is not the case that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic, or they cause, at most, brand symptoms in their reserve hosts, such as cats and camels.
They respond unreservedly without causing a high immune response from the host.
This document contains explanations about the discovery of asymptomatic carriers and the cause of serious cases of human infection.
Serious symptoms are primarily due to hyperactivity of the immune response and cytokine cassate, in which the greater the immune response, the greater the damage to the lungs.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was disabled from the replication of the CV.
The same immune response degrading strategy could have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is particularly strong in mice.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon at the initial stage of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in human beings should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammation in the muscles is weak.
Following this reasoning, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same principles as the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
When it was discovered that betaCoV of the molluscs shares 95% of nucleotide homologia with SARS-CoV, there is a coV of molluscs that shares 96% of nucleotide homologia with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that civilians and other animals on the market are infected with SARS-CoV, the intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 were not identified.
BetaCoVs of pangolins, with high approval with SARS-CoV-2, were discovered, indicating that pangolins can serve as one of the intermediate hosts, or betaCoVs of pangolins can contribute with genetic fragments for the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is produced by accident or intentional man.
The CoVs returned to the world attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coVs in mammals and other animals has dramatically changed our understanding of the importance of zoonotic and animal reservations of HCVs in transmission between humans.
Evidence of wide dissemination shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have origin in the womb and are transmitted to people through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection has originated from contact between human beings and civilians on the markets, the closure of the silent markets and the slaughter of civilians on these markets could have put an end to the SARS epidemic.
According to the same reasoning, Pangolins should be removed from the silent markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in view of the discovery of multiple betaCoVs lines of Pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, it should still be clarified in future studies if SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals, and the way it is transmitted.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in driveway for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transport, and they are an essential source of meat, milk, corn and milk for the local community.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and in Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all the camels for the control of MERS, as was done in the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the emerging MERS epidemics, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we have not been able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may arise and cause epidemics.
A variety of zoonotic coVs circle in nature.
In particular, the coVs of dragonflies with zoonotic potential are very different.
There are several possibilities that these zoonotic CoVs evolve and combine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal for humans in the future.
The culture of feeding wild animals in some parts of China must be abandoned to reduce the unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the SARS crisis, MERS and COVID-19, a better response and preparation plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses exist on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their natural reserves until there is a chance of migration for another species.
Although mammals have many features that promote the spread of the virus, the chance that people are in contact with insects and other wild species can be minimised if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continual surveillance in mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the environment of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing the transmission of animals for human beings and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is that people stay away from the ecological nichos of the natural reservoirs of zoonoses.
Several pieces of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if the ants transmit an anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-virus to the pangolins, it is important to discover that under what circumstances the molluscs and pangolins could share the same ecological nest.
Secondly, if the ants play a more direct role in the transmission of human beings, it should be determined how people get in touch with the ants.
Thirdly, if a third mammifer has the role of the true intermediate host, it needs to be clarified how he interacts with the different species, including human beings, mammals and pangolins.
Finally, since several mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be performed.
In case of a bite, a pangolim or other mammifer, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses that are almost identical are identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will highlight the evolution path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in human beings.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "supposed case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guide to diagnosis and treatment of the infection of the new 2019 Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This guide transmits our experience and constitutes a good reference to combating this global pandemic.
However, the disease of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) is new. Our understanding and knowledge are gradually increased on the basis of ongoing findings of clinical studies and experiences; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our guide and provide the latest diagnostic criteria of "supposed case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic Guides and Treatment (seventh version) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused a outbreak, which is now officially known as the 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the virus is called Coronavirus 2 of the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat the infection by SARS-CoV-2, our team developed a quick guidance guide published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
He has drawn excellent attention since the publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease. Our understanding and knowledge are gradually increased on the basis of ongoing findings of clinical studies and experiences; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guides published by the National Committee on Health of the People's Republic of China (http://www.hnc.gov.cn/) between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020 contain a total of seven editions with substantial changes in some context.
Our guide has now received a comment from Zhou et al., which presented a simple score proposal based on its clinical experience.
This work has added new evidence to our guide and also makes valuable references to this global pandemic.
We started their meaningful work and expressed our gratitude.
However, your work also needs to be updated according to the latest Diagnosis Guides and Treatment of COVID-19 (seven test version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), in order to confirm the suspected case, it is necessary to combine an item of epidemiological history with two items of clinical manifestations to carry out an extensive analysis, or three items of clinical manifestations should be completed if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in nearby areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 were reported in the last 14 days prior to the appearance of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nuclear acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan and nearby areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days prior to the appearance of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a group of confirmed cases (more or equal to two cases with fever and/or sympathic acids) in cases of SARRS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fevers or respiratory symptoms in close to CVID-19 cases; (4) a history of cases of cases of cases of cases (more or equal to two cases in cases of fever and/orial symous acids, symosas, symosas, symosas, symosas,
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with diagnostic resources for the diagnosis of infection by COVID-19; (3) count of total white blood cell count showing normal, reduced or reduced lymphocyte count in the initial stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on any of the sorological or pathogenic elements as follows: (1) test positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequence of the complete viral gene showing high homogeneity in relation to the new known coronaviruses; (3) positive for IgM and IgG specific antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 in soror examination; or any modification of the specific IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 negative for positive or greater or equal increase in the recovery phase above that in the acute phase.
We can note that the real-time PCR review for nuclear acid in blood samples or respiratory treatment was added to the second and third edition (18 and 22 January 2020 respectively).
The pathogenic blood sample detection was added to the fourth and fifth edition (27 January 2020 and 8 February 2020 respectively), and the sorological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers in the search for an ideal kit of nuclear acid detection for rapid diagnosis and samples of respiratory treatment, including blood samples, which increased the availability of different species and helped to produce the positive result of specific antibodies for the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is more and more evidence that reminds us of caring for patients with atypical symptoms and symptoms.
Therefore, Zhou et al.'s fluxgram should be updated, as it classifies the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system also needs to be verified in more clinical studies and practices.
To conclude, we expect more direct evidence to arise and ask readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "sustained case" and "confirmed case", we suggest that they verify and obey the latest guidelines from their countries of origin.
Our team will also update our guide to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, greater daily number
Last night, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on the day.
That's the largest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
On yesterday's date, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research of Bangladesh (IEDCR) reported that the number of confirmed cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online press release, the director of the IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the deaths included four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
She also said two of the victims were from Daca.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic on 11 March.
A hospital agent told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in a video on-line communiqué, Bengal Minister for Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader said that public transport would be suspended for more time than originally planned, until next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport began on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential products (medical, fuel and food products) was still permitted.
The first incidents of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded on 8 March, in two people who returned from Italy and also in the wife of one of them.
On 19 March, the three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 exceeds a million infections worldwide
On Friday, the total number of cases of infections by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus worldwide passed by one million, reported data from the University of Johns Hopkins.
At least 52 thousand deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.
This framework came the same day that Malawi confirmed its first infections by coronavirus and Zambia had its first death related to the virus.
North Korea stated that up to Thursday, it was one of the few remaining countries free of coronary infections.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in 24 hours before 10 a.m. in the Central European Time Hour (8800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, quoting data from the University of Johns Hopkins, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the United States due to coronary infections on Thursday.
In the world, countries have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Friday, Moscow's predecessor Sergei Sobayin extended the total blockade of the city until 1 May.
In the national sphere, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to be paid without comparing the work to 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of extending the national emergency status in 15 days, and the vote was adopted by 215 votes to ten with one abstention.
Saudi Arabia extended for the whole day the length of the touch to collect in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina. Previously, this period was only from 15h to 6h.
Thailand implementation plan to collect from 22h to 4h
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the order to stay at home until 1 May.
Stores in Australia reduce the thresholds of hygienic paper per transaction
On Saturday night and Sunday, the networks of Australian stores Woolworths and Coles reduced the purchase restrictions of hygienic paper, respectively, for two packages and a package per transaction in all the shops of the country.
On Tuesday, ALDI also implemented a limit of a package.
These limitations were communicated by messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the networks.
Because of the COVID-19, buyers were supposed to be stoking in case there was a need to isolate themselves.
On Thursday, Woolworths also limited the purchases of hygienic paper with delivery at home for a package per request.
These changes came after the previous restriction of four packages by transaction implemented by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Cole, in his press note of 8 March, reported that, even with the restriction of four packages, "many stores are still running out of stock in less than an hour after delivery" and called the demand "without priors", while ALDI called her "unexpected" on a Facebook post on Wednesday.
The sales had a "accented increase" last week, according to a Woolworths portal.
The Costco store in Cambridge also limited the amount allowed for two packages last week.
In order to ease the gap further, Cole ordered larger packages of suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI had previously made stocks of planned promotion for the quarter.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Varajist Association, said that variableists try to increase stocks, but that restrictions on the frequency of delivery by road are difficult.
He expects high production costs, as suppliers try to respond to demand, and less promotions.
On Wednesday, ALDI announced that, after the early release of the stock, some shops will not be able to make the promotion of Thursday.
In a report from News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a specialist at the University of Technology of Queensland, said that stores stop the store all night long.
He pointed out that the hygienic role is a volumeless item with low stock numbers in terms of quantity, and that, when exhausted, leaves many empty spaces in the plates, increasing the feeling of loss.
Coles and Woolworths have the opinion [of] that if there was a lot of quantity in the plates, if products such as hygienic and antiseptic roles could be [contained] and were there in quantities, you would probably reduce the panic, said Russell Zimmerman to ABC News.
The recyclable hygienic paper manufacturer Who Gives to Crap said on the last Thursday that they would be without stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who produces the hygiene role Klenex, and Solaris Paper, who produces the Sorbent, emphasized that they were working 24 hours a day/7 days a week to maintain the supply, according to news.com.au report.
The real estate site domain.com reported that some real estate sellers were offering free hygienic paper to the first lease bidders in Melbourne, when fewer leases were being made with buyers entering the shop at the end of the long week of the Work Day.
The edition of the NT News, a daily print by Darwin, included an insert of eight pages with the aim of being cut down and used as a hygienic paper.
Initially, the stores were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report on 3 March in which they said they did not have plans to implement restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have high demand, such as masks, antiseptics, dry products, soap for hands and flour.
As in Australia, on Sunday night, the British online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of the health paper Andres for two packages of 12 roles.
The World Health Organization declares the pandemic of COVID-19
On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the current outbreak of COVID-19 — the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus — is a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemia" simply indicates the degree of spread of a disease, not how dangerous the specific cases are, the WHO stressed the need to encourage governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If the countries were able to detect, test, treat, isolate, trace and mobilize the population for a response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of WHO.
We are very concerned with the alarming levels of proliferation and severity and the alarming levels of lack of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is a "no previous" pandemic.
In comments published by CNN in February, he stated that "without influence, no other respiratory virus has been monitored from birth to continuous global spread".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar position, saying that "we've never seen a pandemic initiated by a coronavirus".
And he continued, "and we never saw a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision of January to declare the emergence of an emergency of public health of international concern.
U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said that the noise, "in sum, is going to worse".
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is a continuous disease pandemic by the 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19), caused by the acute respiratory syndrome acute 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was declared an international public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and recognised as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The mortality rate is estimated to be 4% in China, while overall varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and lack of air.
The complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory discomfort syndrome.
The time from exposure to the start of symptoms is approximately five days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
No specific vaccine or antiviral treatment is known.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended prevention measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth with tossing, keeping people away and monitoring and isolation of people suspected of infection.
The authorities around the world responded to the implementation of travel restrictions, forty-five, collection calls, risk controls at the workplace and closure of establishments.
The pandemic has caused severe global socio-economic interruptions, the addition or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and the generalized shortage of excess supplies produced by the pancakes.
Schools and universities closed the national or local level in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4% of the student population in the world.
The disinformation about the virus was spread online and there were incidents of xenophobic and discrimination against Chinese people, people with descent and appearance from the east and south-east Asia and other people in areas with significant cases of the virus.
Due to the reduction of travel and the closures of the heavy industry, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the province of Hubei) reported a group of pneumonia cases due to unknown cases on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
In most cases, the cases were linked to the Huanan marine fruit market, and therefore it is believed that the virus has zoonotic origin.
The emerging virus is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus that is closely linked to the coronaviruses of the mollusc, pangolim and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms of knowledge adopted on 1 December 2019 and did not present visible connections with the post-marketing group of sea fruits.
From the initial group of cases reported in December 2019, it was found that two thirds had a link to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post suggested that a case referred to 17 November 2019 in an individual 55 years of the province of Hubei, which may have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases reported decreased in China, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be significant subnotification of cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people aged 19 or under, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. The main scientific consultant in the United Kingdom, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected until an effective collective immunity could be achieved.
Cases refer to the number of persons tested for COVID-19 and whose tests were confirmed positive in accordance with official protocols.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and several countries had adopted official policies not only to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, up to 23 January, 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected and that these undocumented infections were the source of 79% of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of people infected in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic number of reproduction (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time from the appearance of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, and 14 days is the most common.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, up to 5 February, approximately 80% of the deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had preexisting medical conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The official count of deaths by the COVID-19 pandemic usually refers to those who died and who had a positive test for COVID, according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths by COVID-19 may be much higher, since it may not include people who spoke without having done the test, for example, who spoke at home, in restrooms, etc.
Italy's partial data showed that the additional number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official death count by COVID by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokesman from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that "we know that [the number of official deaths] is underestimated", a statement sponsored by epidemiological reports of subnotification in the United States. This sub-assessment often occurs in pandemics, such as the swine influenza epidemic H1N1 in 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside China, more than a dozen deaths had already been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories had reported deaths, in all continents except in Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and length of time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time from the beginning and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The mortality coefficient represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed at a given time.
Based on statistics from the University of Johns Hopkins, the overall fatality coefficient is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) until 10 April 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, the estimates of the fatality coefficient fell from 17.3% (in people with symptoms beginning from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptoms beginning from 1 February 2020). Other measures include the rate of fatality (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed who die from a disease, and the rate of loyalty of infection (IFR), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not static in time and follow a specific population of infection through the case resolution.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Center for Medicine Based on Evidence from Oxford University estimates that the rate of fatality of infection for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.33% in general.
The higher estimate of this interval is compatible with the results of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany and with a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak peak and duration of the exit are uncertain and can change according to the location.
Maciej Boni, of the State University of Pennsylvania, stated that, "without due control, infectious epidemics usually reach their age and then collapse when there are no more hospitals available for the disease.
But it is almost impossible to make any proper projection at the moment about when this will happen."
Senior medical adviser of the Chinese government, Zhong Nanshan, defended that "may end by June" if all countries are mobilized to follow the WHO recommendations on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will probably continue in circulation for a year or two".
According to the study of the Imperial College, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (potentially in 18 months or more).
William Schaffner, of Vanderbilt University, said: "I think this coronavirus will disappear completely, as it is highly transmissible" and "which can become a seasonal disease, coming back every year."
The virility of the recurrence will depend on the immunity of the group and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and the infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory secretion (catarrhythmia), loss of olfactory sensation, lack of air, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headaches, vomiting, hemops, diarrhoea or cianosis. WHO claims that about one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list that emergency symptoms are the difficulty in breathing, pain or pressure in the chest persistent, sudden confusion, difficulty walking and face or lips with blue coloring. It is recommended to seek medical help if these symptoms are present. The evolution of the disease can cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory discomfort syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without clinical symptoms, but with the results of tests confirming the infection, researchers therefore recommend that those who were in close contact with a confirmed infected person be monitored and examined shortly to clear the infection.
The Chinese estimates of asymptomatic reasons vary from some to 44%.
The usual period of incubation (the time between the beginning of the infection and the symptoms) varies from one to 14 days, but normally it is from five days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost the olfactory sensation was initially 30% and subsequently fell to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that this disease is spread mainly by close contact and by small gothicles produced during the act of tossing, breathing or speaking, being the nearest contact considered 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that tossing without covering the mouth can make the gothicles reach 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have suggested that the virus may also be transmitted by gothicles that remain for longer periods in the air, which may have been generated during a conversation. Respiratory gothicles can also be produced during the expression, including speaking, although the virus is not normally in suspension.
The gothicles can put in the mouth and noses of nearby people or possibly be inhaled by the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary re-animation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretion, resulting in air dispersion.
Propaganda can also happen when someone touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches his own eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there is concern that the facts can be spread, it is believed that the risk of this happening is low.
The government of China has taken the possibility of an oro-fecial transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after symptoms arise, although transmission may be possible before symptoms occur and at subsequent stages of the disease.
There were positive tests for the disease up to three days before symptoms arise, which suggests that transmission is possible before even the development of significant symptoms.
There are only a few reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by the laboratory, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified in some countries during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) provides that, although it is not fully clear how easily the disease spreads, a person is usually infected by two to three people.
In particular, it was found that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, one day in paper and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Animals of estimate and other animals have already tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus on to humans. However, the British authorities advise to wash their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Coronavirus 2 of the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, isolated for the first time from three people with pneumonia connected to a set of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are similar to those of coronavirus related to its nature. Out of the human body, the virus dies by domestic sand, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with the original SARS-CoV.
It's believed there's a zoological origin.
The genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically associated with the gene Betacoronavirus, subgeneral Sarbecovirus (line B). Two branches of this same line are derived from mice.
It has 96% similar, throughout the genome, the other samples of coronavirus mussels (BatCoV RatG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid of difference in certain parts of the gene sequences between the pangolin virus and the human.
The comparison of the entire genome, so far, found, at the maximum, 92% of genetic material sharing between the pangolim coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove that the pangolins are the intermediate host.
The virus infection may be provisionally diagnosed based on symptoms. The final confirmation, however, is the reverse transcription followed by a reaction in the polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) of infected secrets or computerized tomography (TC).
A study conducted in Wuhan, comparing rRT-PCR to TC suggested that TC is significantly more sensitive, although it is less specific, with many of its image characteristics matching with other pneumonies and pathological processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "the TC should not be used for selection or as a front line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19".
WHO published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses reverse transcription followed by reaction and polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test can be performed in respiratory or blood samples.
The results are usually available from a few hours a day.
In general, this test is carried out in nasopharyngeal spray, although the gargant spray is also used. Several laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, capable of detecting antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of these had been shown sufficiently necessary to be approved for generalised use.
A serologic test developed by Cellex in the United States was approved for use in emergency only by certified laboratories.
The particulars of the images of computerized radiographs and tomography (TC) of symptomatic people include oscillators in glass asymmetrical peripherals and absence of pulmonary wastes.
The Italian Radiological Society is bringing together an international online database of image results in confirmed cases.
Due to overposition with other infections such as adenovirus, images without confirmation by PCR are limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared TC to PCR results and demonstrated that, although the image is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, which suggests its view as an epidemic research tool.
Convulsional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect features of virus images with radiographics and TCs.
The strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining a good personal hygiene in general, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands, Tossing or breathing in a paper chain and placing this bandage directly on a waste container.
It is advised who has already been infected using a public surgical mask.
Physical distance measures are also recommended to avoid transmission. Many governments have restricted or advised non-essential travel to or from countries and areas affected by the origin.
The virus, however, has reached the stage of Community propaganda in many regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and that some members of the community do not know where or how it was infected. Health professionals who care for individuals who may be infected with standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection are recommended. Contact tracking is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and to prevent subsequent transmission.
The use of localization data from cell phones for this purpose has raised privacy issues, with the International Anistia and more than 100 other organizations issuing a declaration asking for limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use. On 7 April 2020, more than a dozen groups of specialists are working in friendly privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth to register the proximity of a user in relation to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who tested positive for the COVID-19. Some incorrect concepts of how to prevent infection have been circled, such as touching the nose and loading with colutors, which has already been proved ineffective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19. However, several organizations are working for the development of one.
Washing hands is recommended to avoid spreading the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with water and know for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are visible towels. Also wash your hands before eating and after drying the nose, tossing or breathing.
This is because, outside of the human body, the virus is dead by domestic sand, which breaks its protective layer.
The CDC also recommends the use of hand hygiene based on alcohol with a minimum volume of 60% alcohol when there is no soap and water available immediately.
WHO advises against touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
The surfaces may be decontaminate with several solutions (in up to one minute exposure to the disinfectant for an stainless steel surface), including ethanol 62-71%, isopropyl alcohol to 50-100%, sodium hypochlorite to 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide to 0.5% and iodopovidone to 0.2-7.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and gluconate chloride, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, in the event of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in a place, such as a office or a plant, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, electronic equipment shared as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and electronic boxes used by patients should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose with the double shoulder or with a tossing or breathing sheet, as well as immediately removing any leg.
surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as using a mask may limit the volume and distance of movement of explosive rubber when speaking, breathing or tossing.
WHO published instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "The use of masks can reduce people's ability to touch their faces, which is one of the greatest sources of infection without the proper hygiene of their hands." It has also been recommended to use masks by caregivers who may have the disease.
WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only when they are at high risk, such as those who care for people with COVID-19, although they also recognize that using masks can help people not to touch their own face.
In several countries, the use of masks for the public in general has begun to be encouraged.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical masks for the face made of bread. China specifically recommended the use of unused medical masks by healthy people in general, especially when it comes in close contact with another person (to be 1 meters or less away).
In Hong Kong, the use of surgical masks is recommended when using public transport or when staying in mixed places.
The health authorities of Thailand are encouraging people to make bread masks at home and to wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is prohibited to go out in public without using a mask or cover the nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam requested that all use facial masks be used when entering public areas in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government demanded that everyone entering supermarkets use a mask for the face.
In Israel, all residents were asked to use masks for public face.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks per day since the mid-March, has demanded that passengers on inter-municipal trains and buses use masks for the face from 1 April.
In Panama, the use of masks is mandatory for the face to go out in the street. At the same time, it was recommended to produce masks at home for those who cannot buy.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) involves infection control actions aimed at accelerating the transmission of the disease through the reduction of close contact between individuals.
The methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters or shopping centers.
Social distance methods can be applied by everyone at home, limit their journeys, avoid mixed areas, use uncontacted greetings and keep others away from them.
At the moment, many governments are demanding or recommending social isolation in regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by the U.S. government bodies and health organizations was rapidly reduced by 250 people (if there is no COVID-19 transmission knowledge in a region) for 50 people and then 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibited public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and committed immunological systems faced a greater risk of serious diseases and complications, being advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas of Community epidemic. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began to replace the term "social distance" by "physical distance", to clarify that the objective is to reduce the physical contact by maintaining social connections, virtual or distance.
The use of the term "social distance" led to the implications that social isolation was absolutely necessary instead of encouraging contact by other alternative means. Some authorities published sexual health guidelines during the pandemic.
These recommendations include having sex only with someone you live with, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-insulation at home was recommended for those who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and for those who were suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for adequate self-insulation. Many governments have demanded or recommended self-care for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most incisive autoquarent instructions were issued to those found in high-risk groups.
It was advised that individuals who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with wide-scale transmission that have made 14 days of autoquarent since the last possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling noise are maintenance or removal and reduction.
Contention is carried out in the preliminary stages of an outbreak and aims to trace and isolate the infected, as well as to introduce other measures to control the infection and vaccines that prevent the spread of the disease for the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to reduce: the measures taken now serve to reduce the spread speed and to reduce its adverse effects on the health system as well as on the population.
Continuation and mitigation measures may be taken at the same time, in combination.
Suspension requires more extreme measures to return the pandemic to a basic reproduction rate below 1. The management of an outbreak of infectious disease, in part, must be seen as attempting to reduce the peak of the epidemic.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services, giving more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Interventions that are not of pharmacovigilant nature and which can be administered include personal preventive measures such as the hygiene of hands, the use of masks for face and self-quarent; Community measures aimed at physical distance, such as closure of schools and cancellation of events leading to agglomerations; Community involvement to stimulate acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures such as the cleaning of contact areas; more drastic actions, in order to contain the source, were taken in China when the gravity of the source became clear.
Other countries have taken various measures to reduce the spread of the virus.
South Korea, for example, presented the mass selection and the localized quarantines. In addition, the government issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
In Singapore, the infected received financial support when they carried out self-employed and, for those who did not do so, were severely punished.
In Taiwan, there was an increase in the production of masks for the face and those who were medical supplies were punished. Simulations carried out in the United Kingdom and the United States show that reduction (the reduction of contagion rate, without stopping the spread of the epidemic) and the removal (i.e. the reversion of the epidemic growth) pose major challenges.
Ideal reduction policies can reduce demand for health services in 2/3 and deaths by half. Still, this would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths, overloading at the same time health systems.
Suspension may be the best alternative, but it needs to be maintained while there is the circulation of the virus by the human population or until there is a vaccine available, if it happens before. On the contrary, the transmission is about to occur so soon the relaxation of the measures.
A long-term intervention to remove the pandemic brings social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral medicine that is specific to the COVID-19. However, there are efforts in the development of medicines, which include the existing drug test.
The use of refrigerated medicines that do not require medical prescription, sufficient fluid and rest may help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the case, it may be necessary to use oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid insertion or respiratory help.
The use of steroids can worsen the condition.
Several previously approved components to treat other viral diseases are under investigation to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also stated that some "cassary and traditional" medicines can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19 virus.
The WHO describes increasing capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs of COVID-19 as essential measures to combat emerging diseases.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and the WHO Office in Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to allocate, at various levels, their resources, including the concentration of laboratory services for the testing of COVID-19, the cancellation of non-binding procedures and separation and isolation of patients with positive test for COVID-19, as well as the increase in the capacity of intensive care by training of personnel and the increase in the number of beds and fans available.
There are different theories about the emergence of the first case (the so-called zero patient).
The first case known in the new Coronavirus on December 1, 2019, in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in the region increased gradually.
These cases were, in most cases, linked to the affected fruit market of the Huanan Sea. The market also sold live animals, which led to the theory that the virus came from one of these animals. In other words, it was believed that it had a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a group of patients was observed and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei Provincial Hospital. The next day, the doctor informed Wuhan Jianghan Disease Prevention and Control Centre.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "coronavirus of the SARS type".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were represented by the police for spreading false news. Another doctor, Ai Fen, was represented by his superiors for giving the alarm.
On 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made a communication to the population and informed the WHO.
Cases of unknown origin had already been reported to Wuhan's health authorities to generate an investigation at the beginning of January. During the first stages of the spring, the number of cases doubled to about seven and a half days.
In the beginning and mid-January 2020, the virus spread across other provinces of China, facilitated by the migration of the new Chinese year and by Wuhan’s fact that it is a transport centre, in addition to a major point of railway connection.
On January 20th, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzen.
Official data later show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States had invaded China and Italy, with the largest number of cases confirmed worldwide. On 9 April 2020, more than 1,61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died, and more than 364,000 were recovered.
About 200 countries and territories already had at least one case.
In view of the pandemic in Europe, many countries that are part of the Schengen Treaty have restricted free movement and established border controls.
The country's responses included containment measures, such as quarantines (also known as house arrest orders, house arrest orders or lockdown) and collections. On April 2, around 300 million people (about 90% of the population) are in some way in the United States, more than 50 million people are imprisoned in the Philippines, about 59 million people are imprisoned in South Africa and 1.3 billion are imprisoned in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were already in some form lockeddown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Wuhan on 1 December 2019. An unconfirmed report suggests an earlier case, dated 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of patients with pneumonia of unknown causes on December 26th. His hospital reported to Wuhan Jianghan Disease Prevention and Control Centre on December 27.
Initial genetic tests, on 27 December 2019, in samples withdrawn from patients indicated the presence of a SARS-type coronavirus.
A communication to the population was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
When these reports occurred, Wuhan's doctors were warned by the police to "slay rumors" about the storm.
The National Health Commission of China initially argued that there is no "clear evidence" of transmission between human beings.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign later described by the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "war of the people" to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the largest quarter of humanity's history", a health record was announced on 23 January to interrupt journeys from east to west to Wuhan, which was extended by 15 cities of Hubei, reaching about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
The New Chinese Year's celebrations, on 25 January, were cancelled in several locations.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Leishenshan, was later built to care for more patients.
Together with recently built hospitals, China has converted 14 other Wuhan facilities into temporary hospitals, such as conventions and stadiums. On January 26, the government launched more measures to contain the origin of COVID-19, including the release of health declarations for travellers and the extension of the Festival of Primavera.
Universitys and schools throughout the country were also closed.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions took various measures, in particular, with regard to schools and universities.
Remote labour measures have been taken in many regions of the country.
Travel restrictions were carried out in and out of Hubei.
Public transport was modified, and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
The control of the public movement was applied in several cities, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) were affected by some sort of restrictions on exits. After the sudden entry into their global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to avoid the "import" of the virus in other countries.
Pequim, for example, imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travelers arriving in the city. On 23 March, mainland China had only one case of domestic transmission in five days, in this case, through a traveler who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, the Chinese award, Li Keqiang, reported that the dissemination of domestic transmission cases had been essentially blocked and that the noise had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were reduced in Hubei, except in Wuhan, two months after the lockdown had been imposed. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of China announced on 26 March 2020 that the entry into force of individuals with a view or residence permit would be suspended from 28 March without specific details on when this policy is closed.
Anyone who wants to enter China will have to make the request for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on 30 March, providing packages of financial incentives to companies. The State Council declared a day of struggle, starting with a three-minute silence in the whole country, on April 4 to 10 hours, matching Qingming Festival. The central government, however, asked families to pay their homes online, observing the physical distance to avoid a new source of COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, the spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed.
The national health agency reported a significant increase in cases confirmed on 20 February, largely attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus of Shincheonji.
It is suspected that Shincheonji's devotees who visited Daegu came from Wuhan were the source of the spring.
On February 22, among the 9,336 followers of the church, 1.261, or about 13% of them, reported having symptoms. South Korea declared maximum alert on February 23, 2020.
On 28 February more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported, reaching 3.150 on 29 February.
All South Korea's military bases were placed in forty years after tests confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The timetable of the air lines was also affected and modified. South Korea presented what was considered the world's largest and best organized programme in terms of population selection for the virus. The country also isolated infected people and tracked and placed in quarantine those who entered into contact with them.
The selection methods included the mandatory individual report of symptoms for those arriving from international travel through a mobile application, testing of the virus by drive-thru, with results available on the following day, in addition to the increase in test capacity, which allowed up to 20,000 people per day to be tested.
South Korea's program is considered a success in control of the exit, although it has not placed entire cities in Querentina. South Korean society was initially divided into the response to the crisis given by President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans signed petitions requesting Moon's impeachment under the claim of government management of the exit, or raising their response.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the total number of cases below in four weeks.
On 29 March it was reported that from 1 April all new arrivals from the outside should enter forty-two weeks.
Through media reports on 1 April, South Korea received requests for help with testing the virus from 121 different countries.
Iran confirmed its first cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2 on 19 February in Kom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died that day.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sports events, and religious events on Fridays, the closure of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran has five trillion Riais to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that he did not have plans for quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be placed in quarantine.
Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March, although a heavy traffic between cities prior to the New Persian New Year continues.
Chinese shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China during February.
Among the allegations of covering the extension of the source in Iran, more than ten countries recorded their cases relating to Iran on 28 February indicating that the extension of the source could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government until that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members with a positive test for the virus on 3 March.
On 12 March, the Human Rights Watch repeatedly requested Iranian prison authorities to release unconditionally the human rights defenders detained by peaceful dissidents, and also temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
The body stated that there is a greater risk of spreading the virus in closed institutions as detention centres, which also suffer from lack of medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in one day, the largest number since the beginning of the departure in the country.
At least 12 politicians in the exercise or adjourned and government officials died from the disease until 17 March.
By March 23, Iran had 50 new cases per hour and a new death every ten minutes due to Coronavirus.
According to a WHO representative, there must be five more cases in Iran than is being reported.
It is suggested that US sanctions imposed on Iran may be affecting the country's financial capacity to respond to the viral pandemic.
The High Commissioner for Human Rights requested that economic sanctions be eased to the nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The survey was confirmed as having spread to Italy on 31 January, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
The cases began to increase rapidly, which led the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare emergency status.
A group not associated with the cases of COVID-19 was subsequently detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a decree to contain the source, including a quarter of the more than 50,000 people from 11 different cities in northern Italy.
First Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the areas of origin, entry and exit are prohibited.
The suspension of work activities and sports events had already been determined in these areas. "On 4 March, the Italian government requested the total closure of all schools and universities by the country when Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sports events, including the football games in Series A, had to be held at closed doors until April, but on 9 March, all sports events were completely suspended for at least one month.
On 11 March, First Minister Conte requested close to almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and pharmaceuticals. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resurrection and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations in relation to the trial protocols that could be used.
On 19 March, Italy passed China as the country with the most deaths related to Coronavirus in the world after reporting 3,405 pandemic-related deaths.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia sent nine military aircraft with medical supplies to Italy.
From 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovered in Italy, with most of these cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of an elderly population in Italy and the inability to test everyone who had the virus up to that time could have contributed to a high mortality rate.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus first arose as one of the most vulnerable countries, and by 18 March 2020, the British government had imposed no social distance or quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism from the recognition of the lack of diligence and intensity of its response to the problems facing the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement in which he advised the interruption of all non-essential and social travel, suggesting that people work at home as much as possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure facilities, such as pubs and academies, should be closed as soon as possible, and it committed to pay 80% of workers' salaries to a limit of 2,500 pounds per month to avoid unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the First Minister announced measures of greater social distance, preventing agglomerations with more than two people and restricting air travel and activities at least necessary.
Unlike the previous measures, these restrictions were strengthened by the police through the issue of seizures and dispersion of agglomerations.
Most businesses received orders to close, with exceptions to businesses considered "essential" including supermarkets, pharmaceuticals, banks, iron shops, gas stations and car office.

On 28 January 2020, the Center for Disease Control — the U.S. government’s public health institution — announced that they had developed their own testing kit.
Despite having done so, the United States had a slow start for the tests, which concealed the true extension of the exit at that time.
The test was marked by test kits by default produced by the federal government in February, a lack of approval by the federal government for test kits that were not from the government (from colleges, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people who would be tested until the beginning of March (a medical application was necessary subsequently).
As of 27 February, Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 witnesses had been carried out in the United States.
Until 13 March, The Atlantic reported that less than 14,000 tests had been carried out.

The White House was criticized for subsidizing the threat and controlling the sending of messages by teaching health officials and scientists to coordinate public publications and declarations related to the virus-related virus-based office of Vice-President Mike Pence.
A general approval of the crisis management by Trump was polarized along the lines.
Some U.S. officials and commentators criticized the United States' confidence in the import of essential materials, including essential medical supplies, from China.
An analysis of air travel patterns was used to map and predict promotion patterns and was published in The Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.
Based on the 2018 information from the International Association for Air Transport, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei, there were the largest volume of passengers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also reported as popular destinations for people traveling from Wuhan.
Bali was reported as the least capable among the 20 most popular destinations in preparation, while cities in Australia were considered the most capable. Australia authorized its Emergency Response Plan for New Coronavirus (COVID-19) on 7 February.
She said that much was still to be discovered about the COVID-19, and that Australia would emphasize border control and communication in its response to the pandemic.
On 21 March, an emergency of human security was declared in Australia.
Due to the effective quarantine of public transport in Wuhan and Hubei, several countries planned to withdraw their citizens and diplomatic teams from the area, primarily through flights from the country of origin, with the release of the Chinese authorities.

A medical trial was performed before the ships, and four South Africans who demonstrated signs of coronavirus were left behind to mitigate the risks.
Only the South Africans who tested negative were repatriated.
The results of the tests freed all South Africans, including the flight crew, pilots, hotel team, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, which, as a preventive measure, remained under observation and for a period of 14 days in the Resort The Ranch.

In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medical and specialist supplies to help Italy manage Coronavirus.
Company Jack Ma sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million facial masks and 60 thousand protective clothes for Addis Ababa in Ethiopia for distribution by the African Union.
Later, he sent 5,000 test kits, 100 thousand facial masks and 5 fans for Panama.
But he also gave medical supplies to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic expressed concern about the masks and testing kits made in China.
For example, Spain collected 58 thousand Coronavirus testing kits made by China with a precision rate of only 30%, while the Netherlands returned 600 thousand facial masks that were defective.
Belgium collected 100 thousand useless masks, which were supposedly from China, but which were actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, China's aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
The WHO noted the contrast between the rise of SARS 2002-2004, where Chinese authorities were accused of neglecting data that made it difficult to prevent and focus on containment, and the current crisis, where the central government "supplyed regular updates to avoid the imminent panic of festivals in the new moon year".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the main authorities to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, the WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that "that was certainly not a WHO recommendation" and was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the area where it was most concentrated." On 30 January, after confirming the transmission of human beings outside of China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the rise as an International Public Health Emergency (PHEIC), the sixth PHIC since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 tsunami.
The Director General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom, said that the PHEIC was called because of the "risk of global dispersion, especially in low and medium-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason for unnecessary interference in international travel and trade" and that "OMS does not recommend limiting trade and displacement."
On 5 February, WHO called on the global community for a contribution of $675 million to finance strategic preparation in low- and medium-income countries, citing the urgent need to assist these countries "who do not have systems in place to detect people who are infected with the virus, and even if they are emerging".
Tedros made further statements indicating that "we are as strong as our weakest eye" and asked the international community "invisit now or have to pay later". On 11 February, WHO at a press conference established COVID-19 as the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, had agreed to provide “power of the entire United Nations system as a response”.
The United Nations Crisis Management Team was activated, as a result, allowing the coordination of the entire United Nations response, which the WHO stated will allow them to "focus on the health response while other agencies can enter with their experience in the social, economic and development implications of the origin".
On 14 February, an WHO Joint Mission team with China was enabled to provide international and WHO experts on land in China with assistance in domestic management and to assess "the severity and communicableness of disease" through workshops and meetings with the main national institutions and field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at provincial and municipal levels, including urban and rural panorama". On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible pandemic," saying that, although it was very early to declare a pandemic, countries should also establish "a stage of preparation".
In response to a rise in development in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global threat assessment of Coronavirus would be high "high" for "very high", is the highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the emergency health programme, announced in a statement that "This is a statement of reality for every government on the planet: OK.
This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready," stressing that the correct response measures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan further stated that current data did not allow public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a statement would mean that "we are essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to this virus."
On 11 March, WHO declared the outbreak of Coronavirus a pandemic.
The Director-General said that WHO was "deeply concerned with alarming levels of spread and severity, and by alarming levels of inaction." WHO faced many criticisms because it was seen as an inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The response included a request to the Director General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom to submit his resignation, signed by 733 000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights specialists emphasized the respect for individual rights during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Group of Experts stated that everyone has the right to intervene to save life and that the government is responsible.
The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health plan should never serve as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts pointed out that each individual has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, minorities, elderly people with mental problems, disabled persons, those living in extreme poverty, prisoners, as well as refugees and other non-specific groups who need help from the government.
Intergovernmental organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as points of view and advice.
From policies to strengthen global health systems and the economy to address the effects of restriction and restrictions on travel, the digital centre includes a Country Policy Traceor, which helps countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the Coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, by the British Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and by the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro for the management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Administrators at the provincial level of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) were dismissed on the basis of their approach to the efforts related to Quentene in Central China, a sign of discontent with the response of the political establishment mainly in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from public anger in relation to the origin of Coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected an earlier recognition of the origin of Coronavirus that began in Wuhan, favoring theories of conspiracy on the COVID-19 originating in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump referred to Coronavirus as the "Chinese Virus" or "Wuhan Virus" saying that China's censorship "supervised a virus that has now become a global pandemic", which was, in turn, condemned by some critics as racism and "a way to reverse the failure in administration to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast obtained from a government in the United States a detailed communication strategy with emerging sources in the National Security Council, with a strategy being cited as "This has everything to do with China.
We were advised to try and get these messages in any way, including press conferences and television appearances. "Canas such as Political, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg indicated that China's efforts to send help to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda for a global influence.
The Head of Foreign Policy of the European Union, Joseph Borrell, warned that there is "a geopolitical component including an influence fight through a trendy and 'general policies' point of view.
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively spreading the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also asked the United States to suspend its sanctions in Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while supposedly sending aid to those countries.
Jack Ma's 100 thousand masks for Cuba were blocked by United States sanctions on 3 April.
The authorities of the United States were also accused of turning the aid to other nations for their own country.
He heard disputes about masks reported between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has confiscated hundreds of fans for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of solidarity of the European Union with those affected by Coronavirus in Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Ambassador of Italy to the European Union, said that "Only China responded bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a phone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" which 80 percent of Russia's supplies were "useless or of little use for Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on a geopolitical and diplomatic offensive.
The president of the region of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, Luigi Di Maio delivered the media reports and expressed his gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical supplies to the United States.
The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "by offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and equipment were in a good phase, they would also act in a mutually needed way."
NATO's planned military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, NATO's largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be maintained on a reduced scale.
The Secretary-General for the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticised the Defeder 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, this puts the lives at risk not only of the United States troops and the various European countries involved, but of the people of the countries in which they operate."The Iranian government was strongly affected by the virus, with about twelve members of parliament infected, as well as 15 political figures in exercise or ex-political.
The President of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, wrote a letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020 saying that his country is in difficulty to combat the result of lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States sanctions against Iran. The latter led the United States to adopt common social policies in other developed countries, including universal health care, universal care for children, paid family license, and high levels of funding for public health.
Political analysts predicted that this could adversely affect Donald Trump's chances of re-electing himself as president in the 2020 elections. The diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea were worsening due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized the ambitious and passive efforts of Japan's Quentin, after Japan announced that any person coming from South Korea would be placed in a quarter of two weeks in places designated by the government.
South Korean society was initially polarized on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed applications asking for Moon's impeachment in relation to those they called for inappropriate management of the source, or commending their response. The pandemic allowed countries to adopt emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could allow governments to strengthen their control over power.
In Hungary, Parliament voted in such a way as to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, to suspend Parliament as well as the elections and punish those considered to have spread false news about the virus and the crisis management by the government.
The outbreak of Coronavirus has been blamed for several cases of lack of supplies, due to increased use of equipment in a global way to combat noise, panic-induced purchases, and interruption of operations in factories and logistics.
Food and Administration of the United States issued warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumption and interruptions of the supplier.
Several locals also experienced the event of purchases motivated by the pancake, which led to the useless empty essential products such as food, hygiene paper, mixed water, including lack of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has warned of delays in sending electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protection equipment went up 100 times.
This demand led to an increase in prices up to twenty times the normal price and also caused delays in the provision of medical items for four to six months.
This also caused a lack of staff protection equipment worldwide, with the WHO warning that this would put workers' health at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Chinese buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of formulas for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the resulting high demand for food, both areas were covered by a severe food shortage.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products have been successful, avoiding the lack of adequate food provided in Europe, as well as in North America.
The north of Italy with its significant agricultural production did not observe a significant reduction, but prices may increase according to industry representatives.
Empty food parcels were found only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, and Chinese government officials released pigmeat reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy, requiring food producers to maintain reserves for such emergencies.
A global economic damage was felt in China: according to a media report on 16 March, the economy in China was very affected in the first two months of 2020 due to the measures taken by the government to reduce the spread of the virus, and sales in the neighborhood fell by 20.5%.
As Continental China is a large economy and manufacturing centre, the viral noise has been seen as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist intelligence unit predicted that markets would remain volatile until a clearer image emerges on possible results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed the outbreak of SARS from 2002-2004.
An estimate of a specialist at the University of Washington in St. Louis indicated an impact of $300 billion in the world supply chain that could last for up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporters (OPEC) assumed that it "confusiond" after an accentuated decline in oil prices due to a low demand from China.
Global action markets fell on 24 February due to a significant increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside Continental China.
On 27 February, due to growing concerns about the rise of Coronavirus, several U.S. pool indexes including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and the middle of the Dow Jones industry have demonstrated their most expressive losses since 2008, with the fall of Dow in 1,191 points, the largest one day since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three other indexes ended the week with a lower than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
The actions have again fallen on the basis of concerns with coronavirus, the largest being on 16 March.
Many consider a likely economic recession.
economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of the central states and banks.
Central banks are responding faster than they have responded to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel restrictions, closure of public places, including tourist points, and the recommendation of governments against any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Kantas, while the British Regional Airline Flybe entered into collapse.
The impact on the cruise sector was never seen.
Several train stations and balsa gates were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, a large travel station associated with the New Year's holiday.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year's festivals, with private companies also independently closing their hotels and tourist attractions such as Disneylândia in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many New Moon events and tourist attractions were closed to avoid mass agglomerations, including the prohibited City in Beijing and traditional temple events.
In 24 of the 31 provinces of China, municipalities and regions, the authorities extended the New Year's wound to 10 February, teaching most of the workplaces not to reopen until this date.
These regions represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong increased its level of response to infectious disease to the highest level and declared emergency, closing schools until March and canceling their New Year celebrations. The summer sector was affected globally, with reductions in the hours of temporary stores or closures.
Visits to dealers in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
The salesmen of North America and the Middle East observed a drop of 50-60%.
This also resulted in a 33-43% drop in demand traffic to commercial centres in March compared to February.
The World Shopping Centers operators have imposed additional measures, such as increased cleaning, installation of thermal scanners to check buyers' temperature, and cancellation of events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, it is estimated that the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million people in extreme poverty in Latin America what would happen in situations without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the outbreak in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of the 300 million migrant rural workers in China were left at home in provinces of the interior or in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
Coronavirus's rise could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to the estimates of St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. The restriction in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (which are paid daily) unemployed. A study by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian families have been unemployed in some way. Almost 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the country adopted the restriction in mid-March 2020.
During the second quarter of March, 4 million French workers sought unemployment assistance and 1 million British workers requested a universal credit programme. Almost half a million companies in Germany placed their workers under reduced-time work programmes under government-owned Kurzabeit.
The work programme with German time reduced was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The performance arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of the organizations, as well as the people - both employed and independent - worldwide.
Arts and culture organizations have tried to keep their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage for the community, to maintain the safety of its staff and the public and to help artists whenever possible.
In March 2020, the world and at various levels, museums, libraries, performance sites, and other cultural institutions were permanently closed with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or added.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and high-speed impact of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, large sports events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion events.
The film industry also experienced a interruption. The Vatican announced that the rites of the Holy Week in Rome, which would take place during the last week of the Christian Quarter period, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses recommended that elderly Christians stay at home to participate in Mass on Sundays; some churches provided services from the church via radio, streaming to live online or television while others offer cults drive-in.
With the Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and the square of São Pedro was empty without Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled services and limited public agglomerations in churches, mosques, churches, churches and temples.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of prayers on Friday in areas affected by the rise and saints were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims, as well as its residents in sacred places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant interruption in the world's sports calendar since World War II.
Most of the main events were cancelled or added, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Championships League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The sudden interfered in plans for the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "reorganised for a date after 2020, but not later than the summer of 2021". Cassins and other locations of world-wide games were also closed and tournaments of present poker were also added or cancelled.
This led many players to play online, with various online games sites reporting significant increases in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, with various music groups suspending or canceling their tournaments.
Many big theaters like Broadway also canceled all the shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live presentations, such as live broadcast shows or creating "festivals" online for artists to present, share and disseminate their work.
On-line, several memes on the internet on the coronavirus are spread, as many are looking for humor and entertainment in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, an increase in preconceived, xenophobic and racism has been observed for persons of Chinese or Asian descent, and against people of the focus areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Fear, mistrust, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and in the Asia-Pacific region.
The results of February (when most of the cases were still restricted to China) recorded racist feelings expressed in various groups around the world about the Chinese people deserve the virus or are receiving a just punishment for what they have caused.
Some countries in Africa have also identified an increase in the anti-Chinese feeling.
Many Wuhan and Hubei residents reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
This has been supported by Chinese, both online and offline, and is directed to those in areas affected by the virus.
After the rise in new focusing countries, the citizens of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subject to mistrust and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed applications by pressureing Chinese entry into their countries to contain the disease.
In Japan, hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was on Twitter's Trending Topics.
The Chinese people, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported growing levels of racist insult, as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump was critical of the reference to coronavirus as "Chinese virus", a term considered by critics as racist and anti-Chinese.
Manifests in Ukraine attacked buses transporting Ukrainian and foreign refugees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, who are bordering China, and students in the big cities of India have reportedly suffered persecution related to the origin of coronavirus.
The president of the unit in the state of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Western Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese destroyed nature and "that's why God turned against them".
The comments were then condemned by the Chinese consular in Calcutta, who called him "misleaded". In China, xenophobic and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were invaded by the pandemic, with foreigners called "foreign law" and "discarte albums".
Many journals with payment access removed them from some or all of the coverings on the coronavirus.
Several scientific editors have made available scientific articles related to open access.
Some scientists chose to share their conclusions with preprint servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory analysis for the respiratory disease of the 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) and the associated SARS virus - CoV-2 include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect the antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and developed only to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (sorology) can be used for diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests revealed how many people had the disease, including those whose symptoms were very braided to be reported or who were asymptomatic.
A precise rate of mortality of the disease and the level of immunity in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, in March 2020 no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were significant variations in the number of tests carried out in the countries.
This variable may still substantially affect the mortality rates of recorded cases, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using the reaction in the polymerase chain with reverse cross-section in real time (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed in respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasofaring or saliva samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours or in 2 days.
The RT-PCR test carried out with pharynge cold is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For the infected persons tested in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material may be withdrawn from the background of respiratory pathways by suction catheter or explosive (secretion) material may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using the polymerase chain reaction with reverse real-time transcription (rRT-PCR), and serves as a base for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test on 23 January 2020. The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical type, a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive the approval for emergency use of the National Medical Products Administration of China for the SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its innovative diagnostic panel for Coronavirus (2019-nCOV) in real-time RT-PCR for public health laboratories by the International Reagent Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of test kits generated inconclusive tests on the basis of fail-making agents, and an obstacle to the CDC test in Atlanta; this resulted in a mean of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
The tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and from then on local and state laboratories were authorised to initiate the tests.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency authorisation. The commercial laboratories started the tests early in March 2020.
From 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of the test for the COVID-19 based on RT-PCR.
This Diagnostics also made the COVID-19 tests nationally available from 9 March 2020.
No quantity restriction has been announced; the collection and processing of samples shall be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Centre in Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Sanitary Monitoring Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic stated that it had developed a test to detect the infection by COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received an FDA approval for a test that could be carried out within 3.5 hours on a large scale, thus allowing a machine to process approximately 4,128 tests in a period of 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorisation (USA) for Abbott laboratories for a test in the Abbott system m2000; the FDA previously issued an authorisation for the Hologist, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepidhe also received an U.S. from the FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test using the technology for the amplification of isothermic nuclear acid instead of PCR.
As it does not require a range of different temperature cycles, this method can generate positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott expects increased production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test using a monoclonal antibodies and the connection to the protein of the new coronavirus (Protein N) is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation of providing results in 15-20 minutes such as a quick flu test.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "torax radiographs have a lower diagnostic value in the initial stages, while the findings of TC, computerized tomography, may be present even before symptoms arise".
The typical features in TC include bilateral multilobular opacity in glass with a lateral, peripheral and asymmetric distribution.
Subpleural domination, mosaic flooring and consolidation evolve according to progressive disease.
A study comparing PCR to TC in Wuhan at the source point of the current pandemic suggested that TC is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, with many of its image aspects matching other pneumonies and pathological processes.
From March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TC should not be used for screening or as a first line test for diagnosis of COVID-19". Since March 2020, the CDC recommends the PCR for initial check.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These may be used to detect infection in individuals initiated 7 days or shortly after symptoms arise, to determine immunity, and in the monitoring of the population. The tests may be carried out in central laboratories (CLT) or by remote laboratory tests (PCT).
The automated high productivity systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although numerous samples can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by skin puncture.
On 26 March 2020, the FDA indicated 29 entities that notified the Agency, as required, and are now capable of distributing their anti-body tests.
From 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA with an emergency authorisation. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epipe Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies for the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is of several hundred samples on time and therefore much faster than conventional PCR tests on viral RNA.
Antibodys are usually detected 14 days after the beginning of the infection. In early April, the United Kingdom considered that none of the kits from acquired antibodies were sufficient to be used.
Hong Kong has organized a system in which suspect patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will provide a sample tube for the patient", they have to carry out slaving in the tube, send it back and get a result soon afterwards. The British NHS announced that it is coordinating a system to test suspected cases in the home, which removes the risk of a patient's infection if they go to the hospital or the need to disinfect a mixture if some are used. In the COVID-19 driver tests, a health professional collects samples by taking the appropriate precautions.
Drive-Thru centres have helped South Korea perform some of the fastest and wideest tests in a country. In Germany, the National Association of Health Statistics Medicines stated on 2 March that it had capacity for about 12,000 tests per day in ambulatory care, while 10,700 had been tested in the previous week.
The costs are the responsibility of health insurance when the test is requested by a doctor.
According to the president of Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity for 160 000 tests per week.
Since 19 March, driving-in tests have been offered in several large cities.
Since 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany remains unknown, as only the positive tests are recorded.
The first research laboratory revealed that since the 12th week of 2020 a total of 483,295 samples were tested until the 12th week of 2020 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from Technion and Rambam hospitals developed and tested a method to test samples of 64 patients simultaneously, gathering the samples and performing additional tests only if the combined sample was considered positive. In Wuhan, an improvised laboratory of 2000 m2 for emergency detection called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: fire, or "Fire Eye" in English) was opened on 5 February 2020 by the BGI process, which is 10 miles per day.
With the construction supervised by the founder of BGI, Wang Jian, and five days later, the modeling revealed that the cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost to deal with the quarantine would have doubled if this test capacity had not been available online.
The Wuhan laboratory was immediately followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Pequim, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
On 4 March 2020, the total daily performance was 50 thousand testes per day. Open-code multiple models published by Origami Assays were launched as testing capacity up to 1.122 samples of patients for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be executed in small laboratories without the need for robotic managers for liquids.
In March, the lack of or insufficient amounts of reactent became an obstacle to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some authors to study the sample preparation protocols that involve the heating of samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genes for additional tests. On March 31, it was revealed that the United Arab Emirates are now conducting more testing by residents in their population for Coronavirus than other countries, and would be able to increase the testing level and reach the majority of the population.
This was given by a combination of drive-thru capacity, and acquisition of a laboratory for mass processing of the Group 42 and BGI (inspired by its emergency detection laboratories "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of driving tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first world on this scale to operate outside China.
Different methods of testing aimed at different components of the gene profile of coronavirus were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German method for the production of kits sent to low-income countries that have no resources to develop their own.
The German method was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Disease Control Centre was not available until 28 January, there was a delay in the tests available for the US and China and the United States faced problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the spring, in addition, these countries together with Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations for testing made by health professionals.
On the contrary, experts say that the wide availability of South Korea for testing helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The testing capacity, mostly in the private sector laboratories, has been consolidated for many years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization indicated the strengthening of testing programmes as the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in US private laboratories, and the supply of cotton and chemical agents was affected.
In March 2020, China reported problems with precision in its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC presented "failures"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented the individual tests. Spain acquired test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but considered the missing results.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be the result of a failure in the collection of samples or the incorrect use of kits.
Spain's minister said he would cancel the kits that generated wrong results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits bought by the Czech Republic from China generated wrong results. Slovakia acquired 1.2 million test kits from China considered unnecessary.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they would be expelled from Denmark. At the Kara of the Ministry of Health of Turkey said that Turkey's test kits purchased from China had a "high error rate" and would not "use them". The United Kingdom acquired 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020 it announced that they were not useful.
The test, followed by a quarter of those who tested positive and monitoring of those with whom the positive people for SARS-CoV-2 had contacted, had positive results.
The researchers who worked in the Italian city of Vo, the site of the first death by COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two test stages of the whole population of approximately 3,400 people, with a range of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all the cases found were in quarantine.
With the movement to the restricted community, it completely eliminated new infections.
With the aggressive monitoring of the contact, travel restrictions for the country, testing and quarantine, the pandemic in 2020 in Singapore has advanced significantly more quickly than in other developed countries, and without radical restrictions such as the mandatory closure of restaurants and sales establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began to strongly advise residents to stay at home on 28 March, but the schools reopened within the schedule after holidays on 23 March.
Many other countries have also managed the pandemic with aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions for the country, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study identified that countries that performed more tests, compared to the number of deaths, had more lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are more able to detect those with no or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples for one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive in % of tests" is influenced by the country's test policy.
A country that only hospitalised people will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that has tested all citizens, whether they are present or not, the other characteristics are equivalent.
Washing hands (or washing hands), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing hands with the aim of removing sweat, fat, microorganisms, or other undesirable substances.
Washing hands with soap constantly in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by golden-fecial route.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or a common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucosa).
The five crucial moments during the day when washing your hands with soap are important include: before and after the defect, after cleaning the child’s pump or replace it, before feeding a child, before meals and before preparing or handling meat, franchise or fish.
If water and sand are not available, hands can be cleaned with sand. The World Health Organization recommends hand hygiene:
Before, during and after preparing the food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After swapping or cleaning a child who has used the bathroom.
After drying the nose, Tossing or breathing.
After touching animals, reasoning or animals.
The clinical hygiene of hands refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or medical care may prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main goal of washing hands is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteries, viruses, or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals that may cause damage or diseases.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the infant mortality rate in parts of the household.
A 2013 study revealed that best practices for washing hands can cause small improvements in children under five years of age.
In developed countries, infant mortality rates related to diarrhoea and respiratory diseases can be reduced by simple introduction of behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple attitude can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing may reduce diarrhoea episodes around a third, which is comparable to providing clean water for areas lacking.
48% of reductions in diarrhoea episodes can be associated with washing hands with soap. Washing hands with soap is the most effective and economic way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (IRA), such as automatic behavior in homes, schools, and communities all over the world.
The pneumonia, the main IRA, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, taking the lives of estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diary and combined pneumonia are responsible for nearly 3.5 million deaths of children annually.
According to UNICEF, changing the washing of hands with soap before eating and after using the bathroom in an angry habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing the deaths by diarrhoea almost by half and the deaths of acute respiratory infections in a room.
Hand washing is usually associated with other health interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH).
Washing hands also protects against the impetigo that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A less significant negative effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin injuries due to skin resuscitation.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive washing of hands can cause a condition of dehydration and irritation in the skin known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among workers in the health system.
The frequent washing of hands is also perceived as one of the symptoms of obsessive disorder (TOC).
There are five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the fecal-oral transmission of diseases: after using the bathroom (mixture, defecation), after cleaning the pump of a child (drink broken), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or handling meat, fish or crustacean.
Other situations where the right technique for washing hands must be used to prevent transmission of diseases include prior and after treatment of a cut or wound; after breathing, Tossing or drying the nose; after touching animals or dealing with animals; and after playing on garbage.
In many countries, there is a reduced washing rate with soap.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7% of families had the habit of washing hands with soap. A 2014 study revealed that Saudi Arabia had the largest index of 97 percent; the United States was close to the average of 77 percent; and China with the lowest index of 23 percent. There are a number of methods for behavioural changes that are currently available to increase acceptance of washing hands with soap in critical periods. The collective washing of hands for children in school during certain periods of the day is an alternative in developing countries to induce washing hands in children's habits.
The "Essential Health Services Programme" implemented by the Ministry of Education in the Philippines is an example of a broad-scale action to promote the health and education of children.
The destruction twice a year, accompanied by washing hands daily with soap, brushing teeth daily with flowers, is at the centre of this national program.
He was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of skin microorganisms is strengthened by adding soaps and water-detergents.
The main action of soap and solvents is to reduce barriers to the solution, and increase solubility.
The water itself is an inefficient cleaning agent for the skin, because fats and proteins, components of organic suction, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleanness, however, is facilitated by a reasonable flow of water...
The sand in the bar, depending on its reusable nature, can retain the bacteria accumulated from previous uses.
A reduced number of studies that analyzed the bacterial transmission of a contaminated savanna concluded that transmission is unlikely as bacteria are infected with the spleen.
The CDC repeats "clean soap with automatic dosing commands is preferable".
Antibacterial saboteurs were widely disseminated to the conscious public in terms of health.
To date, there are no indications that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants may lead to the selection of antibiotics resistant to nature.
However, antibacterial sabotages contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which have an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, although antibiotics resistant strains are not selected by antibiotics, they may not be as effective as they are exposed.
In addition to surface agents and skin protection agents, complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, vet acid) as a pH regulator, benzoic active antimicrobial acid and other hydrates for skin (green oil, vitamins, mangol, vegetative extracts). A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are so effective in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from the hands as antibacterial soaps returned to the final consumer containing triclosan.
Hot water that is comfortable for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot water with soap is more effective than cold water with soap to remove natural oleosity that remains subjective and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have revealed that using hot water is not effective to reduce the microbial load in the hands.
A hands healer or antiseptic is a non-aqueous basic hands hygiene agent.
At the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century, non-alcohol-based hygiene agents (also known as an alcohol-based hand hygiene product, antiseptic hand hygiene product, or hand hygiene) began to gain popularity.
The majority is made on the basis of alcohol isopropyl or ethanol formulated with a thick agent, such as carbomer (polymer or acrylic acid), in gel, or an ammutant, such as glycerin, liquid, or foam to facilitate the use and reduce the effect of alcohol extraction.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand hygienes that contain a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol kill germs effectively.
Alcohol-based hygiene kills bacteria, multi-resisting bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, renovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based hygienics that contain 70% of alcohol kill 99.97% (a decrease of 3.5 logs, similar to 35 decibels) of the bacteria in their hands, 30 seconds after their application and 99.99% to 99.999% (a reduction of 4 to 5 logs) of the bacteria in their hands 1 minute after their application. Hand hygiene is more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Hand hygiene based on alcohol are almost completely ineffective against the virus of the norovirus type (or Norwalk), the most common cause of contagionous gastroenteritis. Antisceptic for hands or alcohol-based hygiene can be used to wash or cover well both hands.
The bones and palms of the hands, between the fingers and their limbs, are frozen by approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The fingertips should also be washed well, being frozen with both palms. The Center for Control and Disease Prevention recommends washing hands with hand hygiene, especially when hands are visualally clean.
The growing use of these agents is based on its ease of use and rapid exterminator action against microorganisms; however, they must not replace the proper washing of hands unless they know and water are not available.
The frequent use of hand hygiene based on alcohol may cause skin resuscitation, unless emoliants and/or skin hydrates are added to the formula.
The effect of alcohol resuscitating may be reduced or eliminated by the addition of glycerin and/or other emoliants to the formula.
In clinical trials, hand hygiene with alcohol-based emoliants caused substantially less irritation and resuscitation in the skin than sabonites or antimicrobial agents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or alcohol hypersensitivity or the additives present in the hand hygiene on the basis of alcohol rarely occur.
The lower tendency to cause irritant contact dermatitis became an attraction compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Despite its effectiveness, non-aqueous basic agents do not wash the hands of organic matter, only disinfect them.
That is why hand hygiene is not as effective as water and sand to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain in their hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcohol hands hygiene is extremely dependent on substances and formulation, and historically it has become much more accurate of alcohol and of alcohol-based hygiene.
Most recently, formulations using benzalconium chloride revealed continuous and cumulative antimicrobial action after administration, unlike alcohol, which revealed reduced efficacy after repeated use, probably due to increasing skin adverse reactions.
Many people in low-income communities are unable to cost a sabonite and instead use sand or land.
Blue or land may be more effective than clean water, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms the spread of the disease may increase rather than decrease.
Like soap, the skin is also a disinfectant agent, since in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends white and sand as an alternative to soap when there is no soap.
The correct technique for washing hands recommended by the U.S. Disease Control Centre to prevent transmission of diseases includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with cold or hot running water.
It is recommended that current water as fixed baths may be contaminated, while water temperature does not appear to be relevant.
Wash your hands, frying them with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of your hands, the space between your fingers and under your knees.
The sand removes the germs from the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when soap is used instead of clean water.
Smell for at least 20 seconds.
The act of frying generates atrito, which helps to remove the skin's breasts, and frying for a longer time removes more breasts.
Clean well with running water.
Washing on a foot can retrace your hands.
Eat with a dry towel or let go of free air.
Hand milled or wet hands are more easily retraced. The most commonly forgotten areas are pulsing, the pulse, the areas between the fingers and underneath.
Artificial and liquefied molluscs can cover microorganisms.
It is often recommended that hydrating lotion be maintained in order to maintain hydrated hands; dry skin may cause skin lesions capable of increasing the risk of transmission of infection.
Several low-cost options can be made to facilitate the washing of hands where there is no running water and/or sand, for example, to pour water from a gallon or coke with suitable roots and/or use sand if necessary in developing countries. In situations with limited supply of water (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to store water, such as "inprofessional tournaments" and other low-cost options.
An improvised tournament is a simple technology that uses a rope suspended by a rope, and a foot-step avant to dissipate a small amount of water into the hands and a sandbar.
The effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is a discussion on the most effective way to dry in public bathrooms.
A growing volume of research suggests that toilet paper is more hygienic than electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the Toalha paper industry, European Tissue Symposium, to compare the levels of hygiene presented by Toalha paper, hand dryers with hot air and the most modern hand dryers with air jackets.
After washing and drying hands with hot air drying, the total number of bacteria was considered to be 19.4% higher in the area of the palm near the teeth and 25.4% in the rest of the palm.
The drying with dryers with jet air caused an increase in the total number of bacteria, on average, by 42% in the area of palm trees near the teeth and about 15% in the rest of the palm.
After washing and drying hands with toilet paper, the total number of bacteria was reduced, on average, to 76% in the area of the palm near the teeth and up to 77% in the rest of the palm. Researchers also performed tests to determine whether there was a potential for cross-contamination between other users and the bathroom environment as a consequence of each type of drying method.
The air-jet dryer, which projects air out of the unit at specified speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to eject microorganisms from the hands and unit, potentially polluting other users of the bathroom and the environment up to 2 metres away.
The use of hand dryer with hot air spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters of the dryer.
Toalha papers did not present a significant dispersion of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Product and Umwelt, different methods for hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in bacterial count after hand drying were observed:
There are many hand dryers, and hand dryers were compared to drying with toal paper.
Washing hands with washed hands hygiene lenses for hands is an alternative to lack of soap and water during travel.
Hand hygiene based on alcohol must contain at least 60% of alcohol.
The clinical washing of hands became mandatory long after Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis had discovered its efficacy (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind the hospital team of washing hands when they forget.
One study found that the rates of infection decreased with their use.
The clinical washing of hands is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to dry and freeze all parts of the hands.
The hands should be washed simultaneously with the interlocking of the fingers.
If there are any residues below them, a cover can be used to remove them.
As the germs can stay in the water in their hands, it is important to wash well and dry with a clean toilet.
After drying, the towel paper should be used to close the trunk (and open the door, if necessary).
This prevents the retracing of hands by these surfaces.
The aim of hand washing in the medical care environment is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germes") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study revealed that appropriate washing of hands and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of infections in the blood stream related to catheter in 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a booklet demonstrating the standard of washing and hair-fraction in the health sector.
The guidance project for the organization's hands can also be found on this site for comments.
An applicable review was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices may measure and validate the hygiene of hands, if the demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization defines "Five moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to body/sanguine fluids
before an ascetic task, and
After treatment with the patient, the addition of antiseptic chemicals to the sabonite (sabonetes "medicine" or "antimicrobials") provides an exterminatory action to a hand washing agent.
Such exterminator action may be desirable before performing surgery or in situations in which antibiotics resistant organisms are dominant. For "cleaning" hands for a surgical operation it is necessary to have a tournament that can be opened and closed without touching it with hands, some antiseptics of chlorexidine or iodine, sterile towels to dry hands after washing, and a sterilized shield for cleaning and other sterilized instruments for cleaning under the soles.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forwards up to the elbows, usually from 2-6 minutes.
A very long period of cleaning (10 minutes) is not necessary.
At the time of washing, water on the front of the front must not shake to the hands.
After washing the hands, the hands are washed with a sterile towel and the surgical bag is dressed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after caring for a sick person.
For the control of staphilologic infections in hospitals, it was found that there was a greater benefit of hand cleaning in the first 20% of washing, and a slightly significant additional benefit was obtained when the cleansing frequency exceeded 35%.
Washing with common soap is more than tripled the rate of infectious bacteria transmitted to foods compared to washing with an antibacterial soap. Comparing hand hygiene with an alcohol-based solution with washing hands with an antibacterial soap for an average period of 30 seconds for each revealed that the hand hygiene based on alcohol reduced bacterial contamination by 26% to more than an antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than hand hygiene to reduce influenza A, H1N1, and Clostridium’s spores difficult in the hands. The interventions to increase hand hygiene in hospital environments may involve awareness of the team on hand washing, increased availability of hand hygiene on the basis of alcohol and verbal and written warnings to the team.
There is a need for more research on which interventions are more effective in different health institutions.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is considered an essential economically viable tool for better health and nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water sources, soap or resources for washing hands in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes this a challenge for the conquest of universal practice of washing hands.
For example, in most rural Africa the tournaments for washing hands near any public or private bathrooms are rare, although there are cheap options for the construction of wash stations.
However, low wash rates of hands may, instead, be the result of confused habits and not of the lack of soap and water.
The incentive and defence of the washing of hands with sand can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of washing hands and cause a long-term change in behavior of the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective for increasing hand washing in low and middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promoting hand washing in schools is UNICEF's "three-star approach" that encourages schools to make simple and cheap steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When a minimum level is reached, schools can go from one to the maximum three stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of the promotional campaigns to wash hands with a view to reducing children's diseases and mortality.
The World Day for Hand washing is another example of awareness campaign that tries to get a change of habit. As a result of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has announced the adoption of an emoji for hand washing.
A few studies considered the overall cost/profit ratio of washing hands in developing countries in relation to classification in DALY.
However, an analysis suggests that promoting the washing of hands with soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of washing hands for human health — especially for people in vulnerable circumstances like mothers who have just given birth to light or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was initially recognized in the mid-1990s by two pre-surgeons of the hygiene of the hands: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant ovaries called miasmas.
In the 1980s, food sources and infections associated with health care led the U.S. Center for Control and Prevention of Diseases to more actively encourage hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine influenza in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 caused an increased awareness in many countries about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect from such infectious diseases.
For example, "artificials for proper washing of hands" were attached close to the washrooms in public bathrooms and in bathrooms of office and airport buildings in Germany.
The expression "take your hands" means declare the repugnantness of taking responsibility or being cognizant of something.
It originated from the Bible passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed the hands of the decision to cross Jesus Christ, but it became a more general phrase of use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands sexually in an attempt to clean up an imaginary weakness, representing her guilty conscience regarding the crimes she had committed and led her husband to commit.
It was also verified that people, after remembering or presenting anti-thetic acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and tend to give more importance to hand washing equipment.
In addition, those who can wash their hands after such a vision are less inclined to perform other "cleanness" compensatory acts like the volunteer.
Religions prescribe the washing of hands for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, using water, but they do not know, to wash hands is part of a ritual washing of the hands characteristic in many religions, including Bahá'í faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netillat Yadayim in Judaism, the bath in Christianity, and the closure in Islam. Religions also indicate hygienic washing of hands, especially after some actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam allow washing of hands after the use of the bath.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam allow washing of hands before and after meals.
Risk controls at work for COVID-19
Hazardous controls in work for COVID-19 are the application of health and safety methodologies in work for risk controls for the prevention of the 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk controls at the workplace depend on the workplace and on the work itself, based on the risk assessment of exposure sources, the severity of disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual workers, which may be vulnerable to the contraction of COVID-19.
According to the Ministry of Health and Safety at Work (OSHA), less exposure risk functions have minimal occupational contact with the public and other working colleagues, for which basic measures to prevent infection are recommended, including washing hands, encouraging staff to stay at home if they are ill, maintaining a respiratory label and a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Average exposure risk functions include those that require frequent or direct contact with persons on whom it is not known whether they are contaminated or suspected of contamination by COVID-19, but may be infected due to existing Community transmission or by travelling abroad.
This includes workers who keep in touch with the general public as in schools, high-density working environments, and in the vast market of large volumes.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic measures to prevent infection, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, protective coverings and the availability of individual protection equipment if a person is confirmed with COVID-19.
The OSHA considers that workers in the health and necroteria system who are exposed to people with COVID-19 confirmed or suspected are at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to very high if workers carry out procedures in people with COVID-19 confirmed or suspected of aerosol generation and collect or manage species of these people.
Appropriate hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protection equipment suitable for the work performed.
The COVID-19 epidemic can have various effects on the workplace.
Workers may be excluded from work because they are sick, because they have to take care of other people or because they are afraid of possible exposure.
Trade standards can change, both in terms of which products are in demand as well as the means of purchasing these products (such as buying out of the peak time or by delivery or drive-thru services.
Finally, sending items of areas seriously affected by COVID-19 can be interrupted. A plan of action and preparation for infectious disease can be used to guide protection actions.
Plans address the risk levels associated with various workplaces and tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors arising in the home and community, and risk factors for individual workers such as advanced age or chronic medical conditions.
They also define the controls necessary to address these risks, and the contingent plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Action plans and preparation for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives for action for an epidemic include reducing transmission among officials, protecting those who are at greater risk of developing health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community, where the company is located, affects the actions taken.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a widely used health and safety structure of work to group the risk controls by effectiveness.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls followed by administrative controls and, finally, individual protection equipment.
Engineering controls involve the insulation of workers' work-related hazard officers without involving the worker's behaviour, and may be the most economic implementation solution.
Engineering controls are changes in the policy or working procedures that require the worker's or employer's action.
Individual protection equipment (EPI) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of EPI should be selected on the basis of the risk to the worker, adequately adjusted according to the necessary (respirators, for example), used appropriately and continuously, regularly inspected, preserved and replaced in accordance with the need, and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of adequately to prevent contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Safety at Work (OSHA), jobs at low risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other colleagues.
Basic measures for the prevention of infection recommended for all workplaces include frequent and meticulous washing of hands, incentives for workers to stay at home if they are patients and the use of the respiratory label, including tapping the breath and toss, preparation of solvents and the common waste, preparation for work or scalding shifts, if necessary, the decontinence of the use of other workers' tools and equipment and the maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfecting the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an essential step in the protection of workers, clients, visitors and others at the workplace.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who experience symptoms of acute respiratory diseases stay at home until they have no fever, fever signs or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of medication to reduce fever or other symptoms, and also recommends that patient licensing policies be flexible, allow employees to stay at home to care for a patient in the family, and that they have knowledge of these policies.
According to OSHA, jobs at the average risk of exposure include those who require frequent or direct contact of 6 feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known to be confirmed or suspected of COVID-19, but may be infected by SARS-COV-2 due to current Community transmission at the place of the company, or because the individual has a recent travel history abroad, in a country with high COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers who have contacts with the public in general as in schools, high-risk working environments, and some high-speed meeting rooms for the virtual volume of sales. Engineering controls for this group and for higher-risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, the increase of ventilation, the installation of transparent plastic barriers, as well as the installation of a driver's window for customer service. Administrative controls for this group and groups of higher risk include the incentive for workers to stay at home, the replacement of noises for high-speed communications, the establishment of high-risk groups include the installation of high-risk air filters, the installation of high-efficiency air filters, the installation of ventilations, the installation of ventilations, the installation of ventilations, the installation of ventilations, the installation of ventilations, the installation of ventilations, the installation of ventilations, the installation of ventilations, the installation of ventilations, the ventilations, the ventilations, the installations, the installation of transparent plastic barrierss, the installations, the equipments, the installations, the lifts, the installations, the lifts, the lifts, the lifts and the lifts for windows, the windows, the windows, the windows and the windows for the windows for the windows for the windows for the windows, the windows for the windows for the windows,
Workers in this risk group rarely need breathers.
If a person is sick on a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the isolation of the patient from the other people by a distance of 6 feet, with the appointment of a member of the crew to serve the patient and offer her a facial mask, or ask the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with ties to the tossing or breathing.
The crew should use detached medical needles to serve a patient or to touch potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and, possibly, additional individual protection equipment if the patient presents fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Luvas and other wasteable items should be disposed of in a bag for biological risk residues, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other ships with passengers, hazard controls include the addition of the journey by the patient, self-insulation and immediate communication to the medical centre on board if someone presents fever or other symptoms during the journey.
The ideal is that there is medical follow-up at the home of the isolated person. For schools and child care centres, CDC recommends temporary closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person was present at the front, regardless of the spread of the virus in the community.
When there is a minimum Community transmission to moderate, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling trips in field, assemblies, and other large groups such as physical or coral education courses, or meals in a chain, increasing the space between meals, times of arrival and more rigid departure, limiting non-essential visitors and using a separate health care site for children with flu symptoms.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, extended school expenses may be considered. For the law enforcement authorities carrying out daily activities, the risk to immediate health is considered under the CDC.
It is recommended that police who contact individuals with COVID-19 suspects or with confirmed disease present the same guidelines as emergency medical techniques, including the use of appropriate individual protection equipment.
If the direct contact occurs during the exercise, workers must clean and disinfect their belt and other accessories before using them again using a spray or a common household cleaning cloth and follow the standard operating procedures for the content and provision of the IP used and for the contents and washing of the clothes.
OSHA considers certain workers in the area of health and necroteria as being in high or very high exposure risk categories.
High-risk exposure functions include drug delivery workers, medical assistance, laboratories and medical transport, who are exposed to COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patients.
The risk of exposure becomes very high if workers carry out aerosol generation procedures in patients with COVID-19 confirmed or suspected, or collect or manage species of these patients.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubation, induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and tests or invasive collection of species.
Jobs in high exposure necroteria include workers involved with the preparation of bodies of people with COVID-19 confirmed or suspected of disease at the time of their death; the risk of exposure becomes very high if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolate rooms for patients with COVID-19 confirmed or suspected disease, including when aerosol generator procedures are carried out.
Specialised ventilation of negative pressure may be appropriate in some scenarios of necroteria and in the area of health.
Species should be managed with caution of level 3 of biosafety.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering the hospital be separated from two different waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspect case for COVID-19. In addition to other EPIs, OSHA recommends breathers for professionals who work at a 6-foot distance of patients with SARS-CoV-2 confirmation or suspected infection, and for professionals who perform aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, fans with N95 particles filter approved by NIOSH or high-quality breathers should be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection programme that includes adjustment tests, training and medical examinations.
Other types of breathers can provide protection and improve the comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend the use of macaws, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, and is not transmitted by non-spiratory body fluids.
WHO only recommends a surgical mask for the selection staff at the entrance point.
For professionals who collect respiratory species, treat or transport patients with COVID-19 without aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, facial protection or protection eye, surgical adventure and lungs.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by a N95 or FFP2 breather.
Since the overall supply of EPIs is insufficient, WHO recommends minimization of the need for EPIs through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to patients in a coma with a patient with COVID-19, using only the EPI necessary for the specific task, continuous use of the same breather without removing it as treatment of several patients with the same diagnosis, monitor and coordinate the series of EPI supplies and discourages the use of masks by asymptomatic individuals.

Licence: CC0: No reserved right
People are in unusual circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have in relation to each other.
Its challenges do not exist before, but we know that our best actions are accompanied by global empathy, cooperation and the creation of communities, which are the foundations of this organization.
Competitiveness and concern that we have seen among all our colleagues through e-mails, links and conversations is a remarkable validation of the amazing human beings with whom we have the privilege of working.
I am very grateful and proud to have all of you as colleagues at work.
Last week, someone shared with me his recognition for our work.
That person reminded me of how significant it is for the world to access Wikipedia now, and what is a powerful symbol that this essential resource continues online and available to all.
The work of you makes it possible, because you keep the jobs active, pay our colleagues and maintain the safety of our communities.
The world needs information that Wikipedia provides, more than ever.
This is a moment in which not only what we do but how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and its role in it, we will make important adjustments in the way we work together, starting next week.
You adjusted to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedules for the next few days and months.
At this meeting, we consider what we think to be an appropriate action to which we are experiencing and the best way to keep the organization sustainable in this period.
We want to end with stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to stay away for a while, there's no problem.
For all employees, service providers and contractors:
our daily work expectations will be 4 hours, or 20 hours a week, until the counter is made available.
We are not declaring a wounded person. If you are able to work at the normal time, it may be useful for our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now, and if you need to take care of loved ones, buy maintenance or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring their clocks.
If he's sick, don't work.
That rule wouldn't have to be expressed, but we decided to declare it.
You do not need to be certified or paid. Just inform your manager of your team's help to review the calendar and schedules to ensure that the working areas are cared for.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, report to the Bryan of the training and certification sector so that its sector can help you and ensure that your situation receives the appropriate attention of the management).
The person who works for an hour will receive the full payment.
We have already said that before, and we are committed to honouring our commitment with our employers and employees who work for time.
All will receive their salaries on the basis of their normal work agent under normal conditions.
Salaries depend on whether you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we fully support you.
Many people see work as a way to channel stress due to the current situation in the world.
The work we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Remembering that your well-being is more important.
We just asked you to communicate to your manager so that we know what to expect and can help the activities properly.
Some functions are considered essential.
There are activities that we must continue to perform.
The Trusted Site Engineering Teams, RH, Trust and Security and Fund Angariation (including others) carry out essential activities that may require additional support.
We will start a process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and change our focus to support what is essential to our mission.
There is much to be done for all of us, and we will focus our efforts on the most important projects.
Dissembling now won't harm us in the future.
We do not intend to "work double to recover the time lost" after the pandemic has ended.
It will not be expected that you are working extra hours to meet the deadlines that are now improbable.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work to define new targets and deadlines, as appropriate.
What will happen to the Annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of working hours per day, we intend to adjust the timetable for the delivery of our Annual Plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will provide more time for the budget, and that employees prioritise essential work, personal care and care for loved ones, while we accommodate those who need or want to work on a reduced day in the coming weeks.
The extension of the Chronogram reduces widely the current planning work load and pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Directorate next week and update the representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
We thank the annual Planning Team for its leadership in this process.
Status, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues at work in São Francisco could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
In view of this situation, we are cautiously using an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a special antiviral solution for hospitals to disinfect all the surfaces, as well as the entrance shaft and all the lifters that give access to our walk.
The forecast is using its own duty protocol using products that are safe for its users.
We are relieved of the fact that the office will be duly prepared for our decision to return.
Our office in Washington is located in a WeWork, which shared its protocol to the COVID-19 with us and with all the Washington staff.
Last week, our office in Washington changed to a completely remote configuration, in line with the guide shared with São Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we are also discussing the location of a office in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue to occur, but they may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working away for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working for a long time know that it can be an adjustment, and they would like to offer some advice:
They limit the duration of the meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If sessions with greater duration are needed, they will be considered to be divided into several days.
They define the meeting, have a programming and send material before reading.
Use videos as a default, with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate real time collaboration and connection.
They have a leader to facilitate meetings, someone who monitors questions in the chat and the list of participants, and someone to help make notes (or collaborative notes).
Send an email to the technical support if you need comfortable hearing phones.
Use their emergency aid to buy boats.
Share the channel #remoties to talk to your colleagues about remote work
The HR operation team is looking for ergonomic guidelines in the context of the web browser to assist in the increase of remote work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all the beneficiaries of community assistance to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as editorial marathons, until WHO declared the end of the pandemic.
We warned them that our request for cancellation and other restrictions could not prevent the completion of their agreed subsidy activities, and that no one would be punished for extending or modifying their targets.
In the coming week, we will continue with additional guidelines on Wikimania and other regional and thematic conferences for the community.
The general feeling in the world community seems to be sad with paralysis, but also with clarity and ability to keep focus on their own communities, on Wikimedia and on other situations.
The communication resource team is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and receive our communications to it.
Keeping up to date on issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars for the next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/ 07:00 PT for a special meeting with the officials.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time connecting each other.
We're in this meeting and we'll help with what we need.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find the information of this email and all other information related to COVID-19 on the company's wiki.
The communication resource team will update these pages and all information in one local area.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have any question about travel, events, a main workflow, or about the cover challenge, or anything else you may need to help, do not stop notifying it and working with the communication resource team.
We are here to help provide support and cooperation as necessary.
If you have a confidential or sensitive subject, send an e-mail to Bryan Judahn, Director of Global Operations of the HR.
None of these changes should be seen as leaving our work and obligations.
They are, however, a recognition that our work and obligations will probably need to be adapted in a way that we have not adapted in the past.
These are the steps we believe to be necessary as support at this time, so that we can continue working, providing our movement with the support they need and providing the service it depends on.
Our planned work will be ours when the time comes.
Therefore, it is time to support each other and create space for the important work that will be done in the weeks, and probably, next months.
We need all of you to make this happen, so we need everyone to take care of themselves and their family so that they are in their best condition when necessary.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, communication resource team (Mananda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grand I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The angiotensin converting enzyme of type 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cellular membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, rim, and intestines.
ECA2 neutralizes the activity of the related angiotensin converting enzyme (ECA) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and by raising Ang (1-7), becoming a promising medicine for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also works as a point of entry into the cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hECA2.
The angiotensin converting enzyme of type 2 is a metallogenic enzyme that contains zinc located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ECA2 protein contains a peptidase domain M2 N-terminal and a C-terminal transporter domain of amino acids and collectins in the renal system.
ECA2 is a membrane protein of type 1 single passage, with its enzyme-active domain exposed to the surface of cells in lungs and other tissues.
The ECA2 extracellular domain is cleared from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as Sheddase, and the resulting solvent protein is released in the blood current and finally excreted in the urine.
ECA2 is present in many organs: ECA2 is attached to the cell membrane of the main pulmonary cell type II,  endothelial endothelial cells, and venous muscular lesion cells in most organs.
The expression of the ECA2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, stratified body, hypothalamus, and encephalic throne.
The main function of the ECA2 is to act as a barrier to the ECA.
The ECA inhibits the type I angiotensin hormone in the type II angiotensin causing vasoconstriction.
ECA2, for its part, binds to phenylalanine of amino acid terminal from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis in vasodilating angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Gist-Pro-OH).
ECA2 also includes several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]- bradycin, aplin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and grelin.
ECA2 also regulates the transport by the membrane of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and was involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 works as the main entry point in cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the link of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 protein spike to the ECA2 enzyme domain in the cell surface results in endocitosis and transfer of the virus and enzyme in endosomals located inside the cells.
This process of entry also requires the preparation of protein S by the serum-protease host TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is under investigation as a potential therapy. This led some to raise the possibility that reducing ECA2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies recommended continuing with the ECA inhibitor standard and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and metaanalysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "use of ECA inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia in relation to controls".
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ECA inhibitors who presented a high risk of resistance to pneumonia, in particular those with AVC and heart failure.
The use of ECA inhibitors has also been associated with the reduction of pneumonia-related mortality, although the results have been less robust than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
It is believed that ECA2 human recombinant (rhACE2) is a new treatment for acute pulmonary lesion, and it seemed to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with a acute respiratory disease syndrome induced by lipopoliscaride.
The mean-life of rhACE2 in human beings is approximately 10 hours and the start of action is 30 minutes after the temporary evolution of effects (duration) of 24 hours.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising medicine for those with intolerance to the inhibitors of the classic renin-angiotensin system (RAS inhibitors) or in patients in whom angiotensin II is high in circulation. The rhACE2 infusion was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory arrhythmia.
Applications on COVID-19 are mobile software applications to help monitor the response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have entered into contact with infected individuals.
A number of applications were developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several structures to create contact monitoring applications were developed.
Privacy issues were raised, especially on systems based on tracking the geographical location of the users of the application.
Less intrusive alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to record user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly to their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with the Joy, implemented an application that allows citizens to check whether they were in contact with a COVID-19 carrier person.
It is being used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, a application called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by the local IT community, released as an open code and will be awarded to the government. North Macedonia launched the "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the application has been awaiting approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracking application was in advanced development stage, and would be available for distribution in weeks. A similar application is intended for Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand provide applications based on the Singapore TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to implement a geographical delimitation application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, listed a series of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including positive errors and the potential lack of effectiveness if the acceptance of the application is limited to a small portion of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple sets limits for the types of organisations that may add applications related to the Coronavirus to its App Store, limiting them only to "official" organizations or otherwise respected.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed their concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially on whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be demanded when the threat has passed.
Anistia International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a communication requesting limits for this type of surveillance.
The organisations declared eight conditions for government projects:
the monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extension of monitoring and surveillance should have suspension clauses;
the use of data should be limited for the purpose of COVID-19;
the safety and anonymity of the data should be protected and presented as protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid further discrimination and marginalisation;
any sharing of data with third parties should be provided for in law;
there should be protection against abuse and citizens' rights to respond to abuse;
the significant participation of all " relevant stakeholders" would be required, including public health specialists and marginalized groups. The German Computer Club (CCC) Chaos and Without Frontiers (Reporter ochne Grenzen) (RSF) also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to deal with the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism of its operating system when it is no longer necessary.
Some countries used network-based location tracking instead of applications, eliminating the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to gross location data have considerable potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal location data; a number of systems that maintain privacy were created to use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, an application-based system was used to run the contact tracking.
Instead of using an exclusive application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including tracking data from mobile devices and transaction data with card, combining them to generate warnings via text messages for potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential stakeholders, the government has also become publicly available information on location, which is allowed due to changes in the privacy laws of the information after the departure of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a series of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, consider using both the privacy system and the centralised one.
By 6 April 2020 the details had not yet been published.
The tracking of contact by preserving privacy is a well-defined concept, with a significant body of scientific bibliography revising, at least, 2013. Since 7 April 2020, more than a dozen specialist groups have worked on solutions that respect privacy, using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record the proximity of a user to other mobile devices.
However, the PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that covers centralised and decentralised approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralised protocols include the Decentralised Privacy-Conserving Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN) Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data will never be removed from the device, and any combination is made on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has developed Safe Paths, a platform for the use of privacy conservation techniques during collection and use of location data or crossing routes to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the technical publication "Applications play sujo: maintaining personal privacy in an epidemic" published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of the MPC Enigma, a commitment that develops privacy technologies and originally based on the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses safe hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive localization and health data with other users and responsible, without compromising the privacy of these data.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was founded by groups which were essentially the same approach and mostly with overposition of protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and allowing the global interoperability of warning and tracking applications, a key aspect of the overall adoption victory.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that the BlueTrace protocol, used by the government's official application, became an open code.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for the tracking of contacts, claiming that they would preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy storage encryption.
They have also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system provides for implementation in three stages:
development of tools to enable the government to create official applications to trace coronavirus by maintaining privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android; Google and Apple are planning to face persistent and assumed surveillance problems by first distributing the system by operating system updates, and later removing it in the same way as the threat ends.
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription (also known as a medicinal product proposal, reperfilation, re-retribution or replacement therapy) is the response of a drug approved for the treatment of a medical condition or disease other than that for which it was originally developed.
This is one of the scientific research lines currently being adopted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of a convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccine for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 drug proteins, each with multiple points of connection.
Analyzing these links provides the rational project of effective antiviral drug development against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are protease similar to papain, RNA polymerase dependent on RNA, helicase, S protein and ADP ribosphatase.
Hussein A. A., et al., studied several candidates who then improved and analyzed their structural similarities with the most approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a powerful drug against SARS-CoV-2 in its pre-clinical study to be recommended for a clinical study concept.
Chloroquina is a drug against malaria that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that the related chloroquine and hydrochloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the clinical trial Solidarity.
The Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo announced that the tests with chlorquin and hydrochloric acid in New York state would begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydrochloroquine sulphate and chlorquin phosphate by means of an Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).
Treatment was not approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised by the EU only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalised patients who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "use, dosage or duration of hydrochloroquine for prevention or treatment of infection by SARS-CoV-2" is not yet established.
Doctors said they're using the drug when there's no other option.
In Istanbul, a Turkish research team is conducting a small study on the use of chlorquin in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Great studies are ongoing at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a test on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydrochloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen demonstrated that favipiravir was clearly effective.
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative within 4 days on average, while the duration of the disease in 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan with 240 patients with pneumonia, half was treated with favipiravir, and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmacéutical Agency reminded the population that the evidence available to base the medicine is weak and preliminary.
On April 2nd, Germany announced that it would buy the medicine from Japan to stow it and use the army to deliver it to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has created openings for the administration of Trump on the purchase of the medicine. The medicine may be less effective in serious cases of the disease when the virus has already multiplied.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to pregnant.
A lopinavir/ritonavir study (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antibodies, concluded that "no benefit has been observed".
Drugs were developed to inhibit the replication of HIV through association with protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a composition related to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about directing resources to remedy drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international solidarity test.
The remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for the disease of Ebola virus and infections by Marburg virus. The Gilead Sciences found that remdesivir was presenting in vitro antiviral activity against fil, pneumonia, paramyx and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the resistance developed by mutations, which may cause more serious transmissions or diseases.
Some initial pre-tests suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals, one for people with moderate disease and another for those with more severe disease.
There are three clinical trials with intravenous vitamin C occurring for patients hospitalised and severely ill with COVID-19: two of them are controlled by placebo (China and Canada), while the other does not have control group (Italy).
The state of New York began testing with azithromycin, an antibiotic, on March 24, 2020.
Japan’s National Centre for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) plans a clinical trial of Alvesco (cyclicalsonida) from Teijin, which is an asthma-induced corticosteroid. The objective is to treat pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
Phase II of a study with a type of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is ongoing with 200 patients, being recruited between the serious hospitalised cases in Denmark, Germany and Austria, to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
At the moment, researchers from the Institute of Coraion, Canada, are looking for the role of colchicin in reducing pulmonary complications and inflammation in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults over 40 years of age, diagnosed with COVID-19 and with mild symptoms, which did not require hospitalization.
They were not included in pregnant women's tests, which are in love with or do not use effective anticipatory methods.
Several anticoagulants are tested in Italy.
Heparin, low molecular weight, is widely used in the treatment of patients, which led the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidance on use.
A multicentre study, with 300 patients, is analyzing the use of sodium enoxaparin in prophylaxis and therapeutic doses. The study was announced on April 14 in Italy.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, the attention of the scientific community has been considered to give new purpose to the approved and developed antiviral drugs for the treatment of previous outbreaks, such as the MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics were identified as being capable of receiving a new purpose for the treatment of patients with COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (receptor anti-IL-6): approved in China.
There are also tests in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The vaccine for COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against the disease of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine with completed clinical trials, there are several attempts in progress to develop it.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, a disease- causing virus, available in less than 18 months.
Five candidates at the vaccine were in phase I of the safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major spread of the outbreak occurred in 2020, leading to significant investments and research activities for the development of a vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genes for the development of possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The initiative of the Coalition of Innovations in Epidemic Preparation, CEPI, stated in April that the requirements for the development of the vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale development and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported 10 different technology platforms being researched and developing during the early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The objectives of the major platforms that have advanced for phase I safety studies include:
Nuclear acid (DNA or RNA) (developerator in phase I and candidate for vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, type 5 adenovirus vector)
According to the scientists of CEPI in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are at the initial stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milk Institute). 37 others were announced, but with little information available to the public (considered in planning or being planned).
A phase I-II test performs the preliminary safety and immunogenicity test. It is typically randomized, controlled by placebo and multicentre, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III tests typically involve more participants in a control group. They test the effectiveness of the vaccine in avoiding disease while monitoring adverse effects at the ideal dose.
Of the 79 candidates for active development vaccine (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 had not yet been evaluated in human beings (continued in pre-clinical research).
On January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a vaccine with a molecular gram, which would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
On January 24, 2020, in Canada, the International Vaccines Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work in a vaccine, with the aim of testing in human beings in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Centre for Prevention and Control of Diseases in China, on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong, on January 28.
On January 29, 2020, the Janssen pharmaceutical companies, led by Hanneke Schuitmaker, announced the beginning of their work for the development of a vaccine.
Janssen is coded an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner in Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the development of a vaccine with similar technology as used for the treatment of vaccination against neoantigens.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the vaccine synthesis and were starting the tests.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immnuno-Oncology, announced that they were launching a vaccine project to create a li-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans "in the next 90 days".

On 5 March 2020, the U.S. Military Research and Medical Development Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Military Research Institute in Silver Spring, both in the western region of Maryland, announced that they were working in a vaccine.
About 10 March 2020, the Emergency Biosolutions announced that it was joined by Novamax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners subsequently announced plans for the pre-clinical test and Phase I clinical studies in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are working with 11 isolates and would take at least one and a half years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in the city of Quebec, reported the development of a part of Coronavirus under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The candidate for the vaccine is researched in the laboratory, with the human tests planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian stated that the President of the United States, Donald Trump, offered CureVac "great amounts of money for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" under the German government's protest.
On 17 March 2020, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to develop a vaccine based on mRNA.
BNT162, a candidate vaccine based on mRNA, currently in pre-clinical test, with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company announced that it would have results from pre-clinical tests in April 2020 and its final vaccine candidate could go to human tests in the autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition of Innovations in Preparation for Epidemic (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a research forum for the vaccine for COVID-19 involving the Institute Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of CEPI in the development of the vaccine for COVID-19 to $29 million.
The other CEPI investment partners for the development of the vaccine for COVID-19 are Modern, Curevac, Innovation, Novamax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists started testing in animals of six different candidates from the vaccine.
The researchers from the Imperial College in London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing an automatic RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receipt of the Chinese sequence.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced C$ 275 million in funding for 96 medical anti-medical research projects against COVID-19, including several candidates for vaccine in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and the initiatives of the University of Saskatchewan.
Nearly during the same period, the Canadian government announced C$ 192 million specifically to develop the vaccine for COVID-19, with plans to establish a national "vacin bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if other outbreaks of Coronavirus occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported the PittCoVacc test, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in rats, stating that "MNA supplied S1 subunit SARS-COV-2 vaccines that triggered strong responses of specific antibodies to [in rats] that were evident to begin 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy School announced the development of a candidate for a DNA-based vaccine as possible a nasal spray.
Using bacteria, DNA will be planned to reproduce within a human bacteria to produce non-fensive particles similar to the virus, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities gathered resources to access IBM supercomputers, in combination with the computer in the Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
That means they can benefit beyond the disease she prevents.
A randomized post-test in Australia is trying to register 4,170 health workers.
It is possible that developing vaccines are not safe or effective.
Initial studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine using specimens of specific animals for COVID-19, such as the ACE2-transgenic rat, other laboratory and non-human primates, indicate a need for biosafety measures to manipulate live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have already been tested in samples of non-human animals.
In 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that has been shown safe and effective in humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. Also, there is no vaccine tested against MERS.
When MERS became dominant, it was believed that the existing SARS research could provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and therapeutic treatment against the infection of MERS-CoV.
From March 2020, there was a vaccine against MERS (based on DNA) that concluded phase I of clinical studies in humans, and three others in progress, all of which are vaccinated by viruses, two with adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vectorized by MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications promoted a theory of conspiracy saying that the virus behind the COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents quoted by various social media publications indicate existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of Coronavirus such as Coronavirus SARS.
Betacoronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of olphate and abdominal pain.
The time of exposure to the start of symptoms is approximately 5 days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some evolve to a viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
Since 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 thousand people have already been treated. The virus is spread among people primarily during direct contact, usually through gothicles produced by cough, breath or speech.
Although these gothicles are produced when exploding, they usually fall in the ground or remain in surfaces rather than remain infected in long distances.
People can also be infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive in surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first 3 days after the start of symptoms, although the spread may be possible before the symptoms appear and at subsequent stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is by reaction in the chain of the reverse transcription in real time (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of the virus and for those responsible for their care.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general population vary, where some authorities recommend non-use, some recommend use and others require use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
The local transmission of the disease was recorded in most countries throughout the six regions of the WHO.
Virus infections may be asymptomatic or develop symptoms such as flu, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty in keeping alert, face or lips blue.
Less common, symptoms of upper respiratory tract like breaths, snoring nose or throat pain can be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented only open in the chest and palpitations.
In some, disease can evolve into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is the so-called incubation period.
The incubation period for the COVID-19 is normally six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will develop within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infections will develop symptoms.
The function of these asymptomatics in transmission is not yet fully known; however, a preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people infected who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and are being studied, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospital stay.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
The scar and salva can carry large viral loads.
Speaking high-free is more gothic than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that tossing without covering the mouth can make the gothicles reach 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually carried by air, the National Academy of Science suggested that bioerosol transmission can be possible and air collectors positioned in corridors outside the rooms of people contain positive samples for a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary re-animation (RCP), may generate respiratory secrets that will be aerosolized and thus transmitted by air.
Although there is concern that it can be transmitted through the stages, it is believed that the risk is low. The virus is more contagious when people are symptomatic. Although it is possible to have transmission before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that, although it is not fully clear that the disease is spread, it is usually infected by one or two people.
In particular, it was found that the virus was detectable for one day in paper, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours in copper 99%.
That, however, depends on the humidity and temperature.
Sabão and detergent are also effective if used properly. Sabão products degradate the lipid protective envelope of the virus, deactivating it, in addition to removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorexidine glyconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected in the medium two days after hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, while the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day tested.
The acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first isolated in three people with pneumonia associated with a group of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature, in coronavirus related.
Outside of the human body, the virus dies in contact with domestic sand, breaking its protective layer. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by the COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through angiotensin 2 reverse enzyme (ACE2), which is more abundant in the pulmonary alveolar type II cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "peplomer" to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
acute heart injury was observed in 12% of the infected people who were hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the evolution of the disease, but acute myocardial lesion may also be associated with ECE2 receptors in the heart.
The ECE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in the heart function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to hormonal prognosis.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has tropsy for epithelial cells of the respiratory tract expressing ACE2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was demonstrated that pathogenic T cells secreting GM-CSF have a correlation with the recruitment of secret IL-6 inflamatory monocytes and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lyphocytic infiltrations were also reported in necropsia.
WHO has published various test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is the reaction in the polymerase chain through reverse transcription in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed in respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab, however, can be used a nasal swab or a cataract sample.
The results are usually available within hours up to two days.
Blood tests may be used, but to do so it is necessary to collect two samples of blood with two weeks of difference and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a branch of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can develop independently, polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) to detect infection by the virus.
Since 4 April 2020, anti-body tests (which may detect active infections and if a person was infected in the past) have been developing, but have not been widely used.
The experience of the Chinese with the test showed that their accuracy is from 60 to 70%.
The U.S. FDA approved the first remote laboratory test on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines released by zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical resources and epidemiological risk.
Opacities in glass fosco multilobar bilaterally with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common at the beginning of the infection.
Subpleural domain, mosaic flooring (seven lobbyings with variable alveolar coating) and consolidation can occur as the disease progresses.
There are few data available regarding microscopic lesions and COVID-19 physiopathology.
The main pathological findings during autopsies are:
Macroscopy: plurisia, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia may be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pulmonary hyperplasia, large atypical pneumonia, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
severe pneumonia: diphtheria alveolar damage (DAD) with excessive diphtheria.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxia.
pneumonia treated: organisation of exjugates in alveolar cavides and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: dissipated intravascular coagulation (CID); leucoytoplastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce infections include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth with hands without washing.
The CDC recommends that the mouth and nose cover with a tossing or breathing lens, as well as touching the mouth with the inside of the cotovelo, if the lens is not available.
Suitable hand hygiene after touching or breathing is encouraged.
The CDC recommended the use of bread masks in public places, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distance strategies aim to reduce contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling large public meetings.
The directions of the distance also include that people stay at least 1.8 metres (6 feet) away from each other.
An effective medicine for the prevention of COVID-19 is not known. Since the vaccine should not be launched before 2021, a key point for the control of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the tip of the epidemic, also known as "circulation of the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are visiblely dry, before eating and after drying the nose, tossing or breathing.
It also recommends using antiseptic for hands the alcohol base with at least 60% of alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. For places where antisseptics for commercial hand are not readily available, WHO provides two forms for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity is given by ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not "a active substance for hand aseptic".
Glycerol is added as a lubricant.
People are treated with palliative care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they are with the virus use a simple facial mask.
The oxygenation of the extrabody membrane (ECMO) was used to treat the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under analysis.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are being recommended to improve immunity.
Support treatments can be useful for those people with mild symptoms and early stages of infection. The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people treated with COVID-19.
U.S. intensive doctors and pneumologists have collected recommendations for the treatment of various agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
By April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetamine) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Caution should be exercised to minimize the risks of transmission of the virus, especially in the health environment, when procedures that may cause aerosols, such as intubate and manual ventilation are being carried out.
For health professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in rooms with insulation of infections transmitted by air (SIIA) in addition to taking standard precautions, contact precautions and air precautions. The CDC summarizes the guidelines for the use of personal protection equipment (EPI) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE container, breather or facial mask, visual protection and medical needles. When available, it is preferable to use breathers instead of facial masks.
N95 breathers are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorised the masks for use under Emergency Use Authorisation (USA).
They were designed to protect against air particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for unused uses.
When the masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of facial scars or, as a last resort, household masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not serious enough to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with respiratory impairment related to COVID-19 is being studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flux nasal channel or positive pressure on the airways at two levels.
If any of these two brings the same benefits to people who are seriously ill, it is not known.
Some doctors prefer to stay with invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles, compared to the high flow nasal channel. Severe cases are more common in elderly (those above 60 years and, in particular, above 80 years).
Many developing countries do not have adequate hospital beds per capita, which limits the capacity of the health system to deal with the sudden scale in the number of cases of COVID-19 severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China observed that 5% were admitted in intensive therapy units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of the people in the hospital with COVID-19 were eventually taken to the UTI.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as the acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (SDRA) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators with high pressure control and PEEP level control are needed to increase the supply of oxygen as the risk of pulmonary lesions and the pneumotorax associated with ventilation is minimised.
High level PEEP may not be available in older fans.
The potential treatment study began in January 2020 and clinical trials have been conducted with various antiviral drugs.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new medicines can stay until 2021 to be developed, several of the tested medicines have already been approved for other uses or are in advanced test phase.
Antiviral medication can be tested in people with various diseases.
WHO recommended that volunteers take part in the efficacy and safety tests of potential treatments. The FDA granted temporary authorisation for the use of plasma by convalescent people as treatment in cases where the person's life is serious and immediately threatened.
The clinical studies needed to demonstrate their safety and efficacy against disease have not yet been performed.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are requested to report their name and ID number.
The application is able to detect the "next contact" using monitoring data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also verify the status of three other users.
If a potential risk has been detected, the application not only recommends quarantine as well as alerts local health authorities. Big data analysis, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are being used to track infected people and the people they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to track mobile phone data from people who are supposed to be with coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen the quarantine and protect people who can contact infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated telephone location data with the German federal government agency Robert Koch Institute to investigate and prevent the transmission of the virus.
Russia implemented facial recognition technology to detect who buys the quarantine.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner, Giulia Gallera, has been informed by cell operators that "40% of the people continue to travel this way".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackaton at the end of the week with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid made a global appeal for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
Individuals may experience difficulties in quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection in themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor, who said: "The increase in social isolation, solidarity, medical anxiety, stress and an economic crisis is a perfect storm to damage people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may have mild evolution, with little or no symptoms, like other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as cold.
If mild cases are usually recovered within two weeks, as long as those with severe or critical illness can take from three to six weeks to recover.
pregnant women may have a greater risk of serious COVID-19 infection, according to other similar viruses, such as SARS and METS, but lack COVID-19 data. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 can rapidly develop to respiratory anesthesia syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
Coagulation disorders associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, coagulation disorders and heart damage, rhins and liver.
Coagulation disorders, specifically increases in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of patients in patients with COVID-19, as renal failure was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have high hepatic enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average incidence of symptoms and death was ten days, with five hospitalizations.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had an average of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study with early cases, the median of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological tests of post-mortem samples show spread alveolar damage with cell fibromyxoid exudes in both lungs.
viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytitis.
The lung image examination seemed to be a symptom of acute respiratory discomfort (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was detected due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to U.S. March data, 89% of hospitals had pre-existing comorbidities, and the availability of medical resources and socio-economic factors in a region can also affect mortality.
The mortality estimates for comorbidity vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Sub-notification of mild cases may make the mortality rate overestimated.
However, the fact that the deaths are the result of cases committed in the past can mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smoking was 1.4 times more likely to have serious symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive treatment or to die compared to non-smoking. Concerns were raised regarding long-term disease seizures.
The hospital authority in Hong Kong verified a 20% to 30% drop in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung tests indicated damage in the organ.
This can also lead to post-intensive post-care syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not known whether infections had given effective and lasting immunity to people who recovered from the disease.
Immunality is likely to be based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases were reported where the recovery of COVID-19 was followed by positive tests for coronavirus at a later date.
These cases are believed to be the worst of a prolonged infection instead of a re-infection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and has animal origin by means of transboundary infection.
The real origin is unknown, but since December 2019, the spread of infection has become almost entirely driven by human transmission to human beings.
A study with the 41 first confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that the oldest date of the occurrence of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the earlier date of the occurrence of symptoms as of 8 December 2019.
Various measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and with time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time from the beginning and population characteristics such as age, sex and health in general.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the emergency CID-10 codes U07.1 for deaths resulting from infection by SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in laboratory and U07.2 for deaths by COVID-19 with clinical or epidemiological diagnosis, without infection by SARS-COV-2 confirmed in laboratory. The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given period of time.
Based on the statistics of the University of Johns Hopkins, the overall interest rate was 6.9% (153.822/2.240.191) on 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the rate of loyalty per case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed who die of a disease, and the rate of loyalty per infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals infected (diagnostics and non-diagnostics) who die of a disease.
These statistics are not limited to time and follow a specific population from infection to the resolution of the case.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been infected.
In the East epicenter in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small population of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by Carnival festivals and spread among younger people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths by COVID-19 must have been formally registered as such.
Moreover, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as verified in blood donors.
69 (0,004% of the population) had died by COVID-19 confirmed.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
The mortality rate is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The biggest risk for men is in the 50s phase, with the difference between men and women approaching only 90s.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for the difference between sex are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences due to sex, lower prevalence of smoking women and development by men of comorbidity as hypertension at a younger age than women can have contributed to greater mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected individuals were men, and 72% of the dead by COVID-19 were men.
By April 2020, the U.S. government was not tracking data of COVID-19 infections related to sex.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women of different kinds.
A higher percentage of health workers, mostly nurses, are women, and they have more opportunities to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus explained that "CO" is of "corona", "VI", "virus", "D", of disease and "19" is since the outbreak was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with the international recommendations of nomenclature to prevent stigmatizations. The virus that causes COVID-19 was called coronavirus of acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly called "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly called "coronavirus" and " Wuhan's coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended "2019-nCov" and " acute respiratory disease for 2019-nCoV" as internal names for the virus and the disease, according to the 2015 orientation against the use of sites in the names of diseases and viruses.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limitations of capacity in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health materials, such as nasopharyngotes and respiratory parts.
In one instance, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respiratory valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver in the necessary timetable, a local startup made reverse engineering and printed the required 100 valves one day to the other.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, theories of conspiracy, misinformation and disinformation arose regarding the origin, size, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease, which quickly spread over the Internet.
Apparently, humans are able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study did not find evidence of viral replication in pigs, cats and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International studies on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 are ongoing in government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to evaluate the effects of treatment with four existing antiviral components with more likely effectiveness.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing candidates for the vaccine.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, researchers intend to develop a vaccine with the total virus.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to cause a rapid immunological response from the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this study focuses on the protein of the spice that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nuclear acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique to create vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should have the safety and efficacy tested. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a code of indefensive genetics copied from the virus that causes the disease. The independent improvement of antibodies has been identified as a possible challenge for the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but that is contrary.
There are more than 300 clinical trials in progress since April 2020.
Seven tests evaluated previously approved treatment for malaria, including four studies on hydrochloroquine or chlorquin.
The redirection of antiviral drugs consists mostly of Chinese research, with nine clinical trials in phase III of redeciding in several countries due to a report of the end of April.
A dynamic analysis of the clinical development of drug and vaccine candidates for COVID-19 was in progress in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, cloroxin and hydrochloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with beta interferon.
There is an attempt to test the effectiveness of redecivir since March 2020.
Clinical improvement has been observed in patients treated with remdesivir through compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are being carried out in the USA, China and Italy. Chloroquina, already used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, there are requests for peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chlorquin.
However, the Wuhan Virology Institute, although recommending a daily dose of a gram, warns that the good of this dose is highly dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorisation for the use of hydrochloroquine and chlorquin as criteria for physicians dealing with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended to be further studied in vivo after demonstrating low inhibitory concentrations of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the protein of the initial muscle in preparation for serum transmembraranar protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydrochloroquine with or without azitromicin have significant limitations that prevented the medical community from adopting these further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The cytokine temperature may be a complication in the later stages of the COVID-19 severe.
There is evidence that hydrochloroquine may have cytokine anti-temperature properties. Tocilzumabe was included in the guidelines for treatment by the National Health Commission of China after the completion of a small study.
A non- randomized test at stage 2 of the national level in Italy is ongoing, after demonstrating positive results in people with severe disease.
In combination with a serum ferritin blood examination to identify cytokine storms, it is expected that it neutralizes these developments, which are considered to be the cause of the death of some people affected.
The antagonist of the interleukin-6 receptor was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies on the treatment of refrared cytokines release syndrome to steroids caused by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
So far, there is no controlled and randomized evidence that tocilzumab is an effective treatment for the CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immunological system from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vacinal method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested for SARS, with inconclusive results.
The viral neutralisation is the mechanism of action expected by which passive anti-body therapy can mediate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as cytotoxicity based on antibodies and/or fagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, use manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are developing.
The production of convalescent sodium, consisting of the liquid fraction of the blood of patients recovered and containing specific antibodies for this virus, could be increased for faster implementation.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of highly related syndromes
Li Wenliang, who later contracted and died from COVID-19 after consciousness of the spread of the virus.
