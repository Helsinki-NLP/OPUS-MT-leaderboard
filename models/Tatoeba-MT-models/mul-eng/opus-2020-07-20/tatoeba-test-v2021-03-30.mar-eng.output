I am Thomas Jackson’s cousin.
Have you shared in the field ministry during the past year?
I live in the capital.
We went to the store.
Is Tom still in touch with you?
Tom will not kill you.
You are not cramped for room within me.
I had three beer, and it was all over!
What is Tom’s business name?
What kind of things does Tom enjoy?
What software do you use?
You are worried.
Tom is in the church.
You are Chinese.
She remained there until the soldiers of the Soviets freed her.
Tom will not kill you.
What program have you prepared?

I went to the circuit work, and I was assigned to serve as a circuit overseer.
I will not eat at all with you.
We kept trying.
I felt as though I had fallen off a cliff.
