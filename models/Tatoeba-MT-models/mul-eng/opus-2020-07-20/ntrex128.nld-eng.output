Members of the Wales National Assembly are concerned that they will be ‘compared to Muppets’
The Members of the Wales National Assembly have been sentenced to imprisonment by a proposal that would change their title in MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a consequence of the plans to amend the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ in ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Meeting of Various Political Parties have been concerned that the new name will be gradually overcome.
A member of the National Meeting of Wales of the Labour Party said MWP ‘twps on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for jack and pwp is Welsh for pop.
A member of the National Meeting of Wales of the Plaid Party said that the group was “satisfied” and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party ‘open state’ for the change of names, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is spoken as a short one.
The Committee of the National Assembly of Wales, which is currently in the process of drafting legislation to implement the change in names, said: 'Of course the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves have taken the final decision on their new title.'
With the Government or Wales Act 2017, members of the Wales National Assembly received the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be baptized to Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Well Parliament Members’ or ‘WMPs’, but the MWP option received most support in the public consultation.
At present, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones would have difficulty reaching a consensus, and they would have to make a legislative proposal for amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation also includes other amendments to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the Committees' system.
Members of the National Assembly will certainly be able to vote on their new title when they debate legislation.
People of Macedonia vote in a referendum on the change in the name of their country
On Sunday, voters voted or wanted to change their country's name in 'Republic of North Macedonia'.
The popular referendum was organized in an effort to resolve an infamous dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province named Macedonia.
Athens argues that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country would make an appeal in its territory and has repeatedly challenged Macedonia's requests to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the referendum, said that he would not take account of the referendum.
However, representatives of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, suggest that the change in names is only the price to be paid to be a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks of Saint Martin's weak, who have Harlem's hard
'The older people I spoke to said that a coffee and a church was established here earlier on each corner,' said Mr. Adams.
Today there's another café, another church to spy on.'
He said it's understandable that coffees have disappeared.
"People now have social contact in another way," he said.
‘Cafés are no longer the living room of the village, where people walk regularly.’
However, he makes sure that the proceeds of the sale of the assets of the churches will continue less long than the leaders expected, ‘and early or late they will be back at the beginning.’
Church, he adds, could be replaced by flat apartment buildings where the kind of people would live that would not help in the remaining refugee types of the neighborhood.
‘The vast majority of the people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white,’ he said, ‘which will lead to the closure of these churches more quickly, because it is unlikely that the people who move to such flats will become members of the church community.’
Both churches were once built by a white church, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolis community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
In the 1930 ’ s, the original church of white Methodists was abandoned.
A black church in the neighborhood took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church under the direction of Honorary John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the merchants in 125th Street, an important shopping street in Harlem, where black but rarely could get a job or be promoted.
In 1939 the building was severely damaged by fire, but when the parishes of Eervaled Johnson planned to rebuild the church, they also bought a beer.
Honored David Johnson, the son of Honored Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, the beaver named pride "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the piano in July referred to the instrument in another way: ‘a cultural shock’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first beer in the world that was ever played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the larger beer of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin had not replaced him.
The events of the last months in Saint Martin's are a complex story of architects and adopters, some of whom were rented by the church’s laymen, others by the Bisdom.
The constitution (the governing body of the parishion, consisting of medical leaders) wrote in July to express its concern that the Bisidism ‘would calculate the costs’ to the consistory, although the consistory was not involved in the acquisition of the architects and adopters who had sent the bisdom.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of bicytomy.
Hair earns 13-year-olds who get to the dock in California
On Saturday, on the first day of the Christmas season, a 13-year-old boy was caught in a cave in California. The young man was amazed, so it sounds.
The attack took place just seven o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been showering with friends on Saturday about half an hour when he heard the boy cry for help. He joined a few other pedestrians to the boy to get him out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought he was calling the boy because he had caught a snake, but then he realized that the boy cried: ‘ I’m praying!
I'm praying!'
His key legs were completely open," saw Hammel as he approached the boy.
"I wrote that every man must go out of the water, saying, 'He is a horse in the water.'
The boy was taken with a helicopter to the Rady Child Hospital in San Diego, where he was injured in a life-threatening accident.
It is not known what kind of horse is responsible for the attack.
Captain Larry Giles told at a pers conference that a horse was shot in the neighborhood a few weeks ago, but that it was then concluded that it wasn't going to be a dangerous kind of horse.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured in the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours with a view to research and safety.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sheep live in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsburys wants to break up on the British beauty market
Sainsbury's competition goes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and direct beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in large store houses.
The initiative is part of a strategy to cover the British beauty market, which is worth €2.8 billion and continues to grow, while the sale of fashion and household items continues to fall. The larger beauty departments are sold in 11 shops throughout the country. If they are successful, they will be introduced into more shops next year.
Investment in the beauty market is also a consequence of the fact that supermarkets are ever going to fill the bill of TVs, magnets and interior articles with other products.
Sainsburys wants to double its beauty offer and offer 3,000 products, including first brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also gets more space, with outspaces per brand, such as in shops like Boats.
The supermarket also restores its Boutique-make-up on the market, now most products are suitable for vegans, something younger shoppers still need.
In addition, perfumery will test the Fragrance Shop concessions in two stores of Sainsbury. The first was opened in Croydon, south of London, the second will be opened in Selly Oak, in Birmingham this year.
As more and more people are shopping online and are increasingly buying small quantities of food on a daily basis in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsburys, says that the shops will continue to look more like wholesale houses, now the supermarkets are taking it against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsburys has integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of shops and has opened a number of Habitats since two years ago. According to the company, the sale of food has increased by this and the overnames have produced more income.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its departments Beauty and Apothec a makeover, it was a fly.
The Sainsburys started a cooperation with Boots in the year 2000, but the cooperation was terminated when a conflict arose about the distribution of income from the apothecary division in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's 281 apothecaries in the shops three years ago for a total of 125 million British pounds sold to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding a wide range of skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsburys, said: ‘We have completely changed the arrangement of our beauty department so that it is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our staff, who will be ready to give advice.
With our offer of notes, we offer anything we want, and thanks to the attractive environment and the handy locations we make sure that our customers like to buy their beauty products with us, and no longer shop in the old way.'
Peter Jones 'heavy' after Holly Willoughby returns out of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is 'heavy' because TV representative Holly Willoughby has withdrawn himself from a deal of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly, their brand for home year and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is even compared to the brand Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old representative of This Morning announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Peter Jones of Dragons It is rare on Holly Willoughby, because she has recently withdrawn from her profitable lifestyle business to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was ‘angered’ when Willoughby was on Tuesday during a difficult meeting at the company’s headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire announced that she did not have enough time for Truly, their homeway brand and accessories by means of her new contracts (with a value of about half a million pounds).
The company will be compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and will be expected to double Willoughby's fortune at estimated 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones went to one of his vacation apartments abroad.
One source said: ‘Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It would ensure her future for a long time, and provide enough for the next decade.
Everyone was bluffed when she decided to get back.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was soon planned.
The main establishment store in Marlow is full of products ready for sale.'
Experts believe that the departure of the representative, one of the most profitable stars of Great Britain, could cost the company millions, as a result of the large investments in products of costumes and cards to wear and wear, and because the launch could now take further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been good friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, became president of the company in March.
The two seats often go together on holiday and Jones has a 40 percent share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will soon be a M&S brand ambassador and will be replaced by Ant McPartlin as the representative of the I'm A Celebrity programme on the British ITV sender.
A source from Jones' entourage said last night: ‘We have no comment on his business affairs.’
Hard language 'and then was the love between us'
He took note of the criticism he would receive in the media about a comment he made that some people would find 'not fit for a president' and his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given so much?
Trump invented a novelist when he said:
'I didn't say anything.'
He added that Kim was interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards the decommissioning of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
However, negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons have been concluded.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, senior diplomat Ri Yong Ho of North Korea told leaders of the General Assembly of the United Nations that North Korea does not see a ‘agreement response’ by the United States after the first North Korea disarmament initiatives.
In the meantime, the United States is going under sanctions to keep pressure on the chain, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
"We're doing very well in North Korea," he said.
“We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a wonderful relationship.'
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim led to positive results, the rocket tests were completed, the hostages were released, and the material surpluses of American soldiers were returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach with regard to his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to behave as a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get access to these printed arenas, there would be about 200 people here," said Trump, while he was in front of the audience.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia destroy an island where hundreds of people die
In the landing of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs heard that their aid was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had no more housing, no national disaster was announced, which is a requirement for international aid to be launched.
'In many cases, it is very clear that she does not ask for international help, which is difficult for us,' said Mrs. Sumbung.
Save the Children is involved in the formation of a team to travel to Palu, but it is not sure that the relief workers from abroad can work elsewhere.
Mr Sutopo, director of the national disaster relief agency, said that Indonesian officials were still considering the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still particularly badly prepared for the anger of nature.
In Aceh, school sites were built to be used in Tsunamis, but along other coasts you can see these only rarely.
That there was no warning series for tsunamis in Palu, although there was a strong warning, probably contributed to the number of deaths.
Even in ideal circumstances it may be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship that was hosted in Lombok to deal with victims of earthquakes is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship reaches the site of the disaster.
The improvement of the heavy infrastructure of Indonesia was one of the core points of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and he has already spent a lot of money on roads and roads.
But President Joko's government has to fight a lack of funding, and he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure by persistent sectoral efforts in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority are now following a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic gangs fought on the street, with masks, arrow and bow and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool provides impressive equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge needed Liverpool last Saturday for losses against Chelsea in the Premier League, with a target in the 89th minute, during a fight in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he stood at a distance of about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal, at the moment his plane was behind 1-0.
He cut left against the ball and then shot in the direction of the front ball.
The ball was high above the penal area, in the direction of the right corner of the net.
He's re-evaluating the origin of Kepa Arrizabalaga and lots of it.
"It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much as possible ahead," Sturridge said against LiverpoolFC.com.
'I saw Kante approaching, and I was trying. I didn't really think about it, I just jumped on the ball.'
Chelsea stood at the rest with 1-0, after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The tip of The Blues drew the ball with its tail to Mateo Kovacic, where he rushed through the middle field to Liverpool's game.
Kovacic made a quick one-second in the middle field.
After that, he gave a fine catch, so that Hazard could reach the capital.
Hazard was faster than the defense and shot the ball with his left foot across Alison Becker of Liverpool in the net, next to the back deck.
Liverpool plays on Wednesday about 15 hours in the champions League's group phase against Naples, in the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea takes the Thursday at 15 o'clock in London against Videoton in the UEFA Europe League.
The number of tsunamis in Indonesia runs up to 832
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia occurred to 832, said the Agency for Assistance in National Disasters in the morning.
Many people were stuck in the mud of buildings that were built as a result of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 of the previous Friday, with waves up to 6 m high, said the speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is surrounded by ruined buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man for murder after his wife was killed
This morning the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside, where a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 in Grayson Mews in John Street. The body appeared to be wild. A 32-year-old man was arrested for thinking of murder.
The police ask the local residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation has just started, but I want everyone who finds themselves in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard something suspicious or asked to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, in particular taxi drivers, to contact if they may have filmed something through a dashcam. They can always have information that is essential for our research.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This morning came friends who thought they knew the woman in place to ask questions about where they were found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have confirmed that they are currently raising the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to enter his apartment, but he got the police to hear that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what happened.
The residents will now hear that it will take hours before they can return home.
A police officer would have told anyone that the area is treated as a crime.
A woman appears crying in the square.
She's still saying, "That's too bad!"
At 14 hours two police cars stood in the station and one third stood outside.
During the settlement, a number of agents kept the apartment building in the streets.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call to 101 or contact Crimesstoppers on number 0800 555 111, with log 247 of 30 September.
Photo of Cromwell to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriteting history' series
The binding of the statue would be a poignant justice for the devastating destruction of the many cultural and religious works of art carried out by its fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Dr. Crick's suggestion as 'dwaas' and 'an attempt to re-write history.'
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: ‘It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of images would lead to the fishing of the figure of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses or Parliament.
The iconclasm of the English citizen accounts was still approved, or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The beautiful picture of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thornycroft, testifies to the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and is part of the story of a figure that many believe is still to be recognized.
Dr. Goldsmith said against The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defence of Parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether it is a complete correct presentation, it is still debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual identifiable figure that represents one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector should also be recognized and rethinked.'
Murderous pig killed Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in the southwestern part of China, according to reports in the local media.
The man from whom only the alien name ‘Yuan’ was known was killed on a market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou. His winner was overboard and he was under the blood, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farm prepares for feeding pigs at a pig market in Xining, Qinghai, China, on 30 May 2005.
He would have gone home on Wednesday with his nephew from the nearby province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his neighbor found him dead, and a door was opened to a nearby pigeon.
According to the needle, there was a large male pig with blood on his back in the piggy.
According to a federal study, the livestock killed 250 kg of the farmer, so the report.
‘The bones of my neighbor were bleeding and reduced,’ said the neighbor with the alien name ‘Wu’, according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
On images of surveillance cameras it is seen that Yuan arrived on Thursday at 4.40 a.m. on the market to carry his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal the man killed was not Yuan or his neighbor.
A market official told the Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent the other from attacking, while the police collected evidence in place.
After all, Yuan's family and market authorities are currently negotiating a compensation for his death.
It's just rare, but there have been cases of dogs attacking people before.
In 2016 a pig caught a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, where the man was seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a 300 kg pig died a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife took the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was killed by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba at CBC News testified that the dogs were not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood aggression could be eliminated.
‘They're just games.
It's just children, very curious... they're not out there to hurt people.
You just have to show her the right amount," he said.
The status of Orcaan Rosa brings heavy rain to the south-west of the U.S.
As predicted, Orcaan Rosa has now reached the cool waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
The next days, however, Rosa will bring heavy rain to the north of Mexico and to the south.
With a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was on Sunday morning at 5 hours a local time of category 1, and is located 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa's going to be up to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it begins to form a hill above the Pacific, which moves east toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the coast of Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical moisture is pushed northward, to the southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will bring 10 centimetres of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then Tropical weight that responds to the approaching rise will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the south.
Local will cause 2 to 10 cm of rain dangerous floods, rain currents and possible earthquakes in the desert.
Tropical weight will lead to a minimum of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to be 5 to 10 cm rain in parts of the south-west, especially above most of Arizona.
There are sudden floods possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions, as tropical rain can fall very widespread.
It is strongly advised to walk into the desert when the tropical rainfall threatens.
The heavy rainfall can turn ravines into desert rivers, and it will bring local winds and dust.
The nearby hill places heavy rains to parts of the coastal South California.
There are rain of 1.5 cm possible, which could lead to small pumps and smooth roads.
This would be the first rain fall in the region in the rain season.
Widespread tropical kingdoms will approach Arizona Sunday morning, after which the rain will be extended by the end of the day and Tuesday more.
Heavy rainfall will spread over the Four Corners Tuesday and will continue to fall with the rest of the day.
In October, the temperature in the U.S. can melt strongly because the North Pole becomes cooler, but the troops remain fairly warm.
This sometimes leads to major differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a beautiful example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the U.S. on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the continuing summer heat will try to build up and re-examine.
In a large part of the mid- and east of the U.S., it would begin to warm up in October, with temperatures rising around 30°C, from the southern regions to the north-east.
In New York it can be 27 degrees, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
From our long-term weather forecast, it is clear that the possibility is large until mid-October at higher average temperatures in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million people were watching Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched one of the six television works on Thursday to the incoming witness by Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of having an affair that goes to the evening.
In the meantime, the political impasse continued, while the regular programming was interrupted for the surprise of the day: an agreement by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, was arranged to investigate the complaint for a week.
Ford told the Senate Commission for Justice that she was 100% sure that a drunk Kavanaugh had beaten her and tried to remove her clothes during a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in a relative witness that he was 100% sure that this wasn't happening.
Likely more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen have watched Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediate figures available for the other networks that sent the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble counting people looking at an office.
To compare: that is about a playoff for a football race or for the Oscar race.
Fox News Channel, which all supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had most observers during the day of the hearing: average 5.69 million observers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million observers.
CBS has 3.1 million viewers, NBC has 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC has 2.89 million viewers and CNN has 2,52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
After the hearing, the audience was also very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the office of the former Republic made a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his vote, the CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday morning that the applicants were writing to him when he tried to take the lift to a hearing of the Commission for Justice.
He stayed a few minutes with low-sighted eyes while he was conceived, alive on CNN.
'I'm standing here for you,' said one woman.
‘Do you think he tells the people the truth?
Someone called: ‘You have power, while so many women are without power.’
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and a floor for the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various senders sent out all alive when the judicial committee had to vote later on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate.
But Flake said that he would vote only in favour of his understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the suspect next week, something that the Democrats of the minority would change.
Flake was convinced, among other things, by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
The choice was important because it was clear that the Republics would not have the necessary votes to choose Kavanaugh well without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation to charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May politicali criticised her plans to leave the European Union 'a political game' with the future of Britain and the subordination of national interests.
Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May will attend the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for the Brexit, and he said that her proposal that Britain and the EU were 'disputed' in each other'.
Shooting party Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting party where Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, was shot.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and is in prison for murder, said Baton Rouge's police.
The authorities brought out a video from the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims lost their glasses during the war.
The police found the brightness on the spot and found Simpson's DNA on the bridge, reports WAFB, a television station of CBS.
The police questioned Simpson and later explained that he had known that he had shot Wade with death.
His town is set at $350,000, reports the Advocate.
The congregation’s similar shepherd in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday that states that the cause of death is a shadow in the neck.
The report states that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the state police, the Southern University police and local residents have all contributed to the investigation leading to arrest.
Sport director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked the local police for his "incentives and efforts for justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm big and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He held 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per competition last season.
On Friday morning, LSU-basket ballcoach Will Wade said the team's 'kapot' and 'in shock' is dead by Wades.
"It's an event you always hope will never happen," says Wade.
Volcanic as in Mexico City
The impact of the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern regions of the capital city of Mexico.
The National Rampen Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity in the crater was suspended and 183 gas emissions and were recorded within 24 hours.
The centre detected several times round and trilling.
Social media displays photos of a thin layer than on highway routes in rural Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysci has seen an increase in activity in the volcano, located at 72 kilometres south of the capital city. That is the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a force of 7.1 hit the shore of Richter Central Mexico.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clasht with Catalan separatists on the evening of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after pro-independence activists struck with the pro-police, while thousands of participants in rival demonstrations on the first anniversary of the vote on independence in Catalonia, which the region in two groups failed.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were opposed by the opposition police confused the agents with eggs and powder, causing dark dust in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later on the day, the police broke out of the police, and the officers pulled up their button to keep the fighting going.
Over an hour of singing pro-independence groups: 'Don't forget, don't forgive', while their opponents shout 'Long live Spain'.
Forty people were treated for light injuries they experienced during the protests reported the local press.
The tensions remain high in the region of independence, one year after the referendum of 1 October, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but which is rejected by separatist Catalans.
The electors are too proud to be independent, although the arrival was low and the people who are opposed to the vote are boycotts.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote in the voting stations in the region, where it became violent screen savers.
Pro-independence groups had been campaigning on Saturday night to prevent demonstrations to support national police.
The demonstration went through, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who shared the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about the prospects of Catalonia to become independent.
‘Last year we met one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw how my parents cried with joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties had a key victory in the regional elections in December, even though it was nipty, this year it was difficult for them to build on their success. Many of their most famous leaders have always been absent, either in exile or in prison in waiting for a legal case on their role in organizing the referendum and calling for independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mounter who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict was halted by politicians on both sides.
'The tension is rising,' he said.
Today, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in provisional custody since the end of last year, announced that he will take part in the European Parliament's elections next year.
"A candidate for European elections is the best way to complain about the consequences of the democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonerry: men arrested after the house was hit by a car
Three men from 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after a car repeatedly broke into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Thursday about 19.30 a.m. local time for Ballynagard Crescent.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the doors and the building had been damaged.
It is possible that at a given moment a crossbook was also burned on the car.
Livingston won with 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave them the victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and worried Steven Gerarrd his second low in a series of 18 matches since he was manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's goal was to make the difference and Gary Holt's stroke came to equal height with Hibernian.
Gerards did not win this season to win an exploding battle during the Premiership. They have to take it on Sunday against Leader Hearts, who holds eight points on them.
But first, the Rangers Rapid Vienna will receive Thursday in Europe League.
Livingston remains unscathed. The crew has already been fighting each other for six months in his department, and Coach Holt hasn't been down since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a chance against strong visitors
Holt's approach was long for the first goal to be achieved as a front-end. Its direct way of playing provided a lot of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but he didn't succeed in making it off with a target. Then Alan Lithgow, who invented Craig Halkett's headball, shot the ball above the target.
The housework allows the Rangers to play with great pleasure, and wait for his chances to be quiet and secure.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers left a free trail and Livingston provided for an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who was escorted from the penal area.
At that time the Rangers had been balsating for a long time, but the defense of the home was inevitable and the target man Liam Kelly had not yet had much to do.
The pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure that Kelly had a goal.
Scott Pittman shot the ball against the legs of Rangers targetman Allan McGregor and Lithgow lost the goal after a show of his colleagues from Livingstone.
In the meantime, the punishment area of Livingston was threatened, but they were returned every time. Twice a punishment was refused, one after Halkett's attack on invasive Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
"Fenomenal" of Livingston - Analysis
Lasadair Lamont from BBC Scotland in Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
Without exception, they played excellent and continued to overcome expectations in their race to the top.
Their style of play and composition of their crew have been almost altered since their return to the highest regions, but Holt deserves much recognition for the way he has raised the team since his arrival.
He was so lucky.
The leader Halkett was fantastic, with excellent organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall were running during the entire competition at the top of their tents.
But the Rangers didn't know by breaking up.
Even though they played very well under Gerard this time, they did not reach their usual level.
Their final phase wasn't good enough (they succeeded only once to split the house) and the Rangers will now realize that they have to play better. They are always somewhere in the middle of the class.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Keolen
Under a bright blue sky and with a wide smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went on Saturday (September 29th) together in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They are not even on issues such as human rights, privacy and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan left for Keolen to open a giant new mosque.
Keulen is the home base of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police appeared for security reasons when they called the crowd of 25,000 people to gather for the mosque, but many sympathetic people came near to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurdens, also listened to their voice, condemned both the politics of Erdogan and the decision of the German government to welcome him in the country.
The rival protests reflect the division of a visitor who is regarded by some German Turks as a hero and who is accused of being autocrats.
Traffic accident in Deptford: The trainer dies after car crash
In London a biker was surrounded by a bus accident.
The accident occurred near the crossing point of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, about 10.15 p.m.
The driver stopped the car and the ambulance staff were present, but the man died somewhere.
A few months ago, another passenger died in an accident with a refugee traffic on Children's Street, about a mile away from the accident of Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said that agents were involved in identifying the man and his immediate family would bring them up.
The road is closed in several places, buses are turned around and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Prison of Long Lartin: six Cypriots executed during interrogation
Six Cypriots have been wounded in an order disturbance in a heavily secured prison for men, according to the prison office.
The missing day spent about 9.30 a.m. local time in HMP Long Larsin in Worcestershire and are still running.
Specialised ‘Tornado’ chips are set up to resolve a situation involving eight prisoners in one section.
The capiers were treated locally for light injuries in the face.
A spokesman from the Prison Law said: ‘It is specially trained prison personnel placed for an actual incident in HMP Long Larsin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and in any case the officials will be referred to the police and may have to remain behind the tralias.'
In HMP Long Larsin, more than 500 prisoners remain, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the director of the prison in the hospital was treated after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the opposition police were called into prison for a serious order disorder that had been attacked by billiards.
Orkaan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (with possible positive effects for dry areas)
It is rare that a tropical depression will reach Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to occur next week. This is because the remaining energy of Orcaan Rosa moves about the south-west of the desert area, which poses risks for pollution.
The National Weather Service has already given warnings of sudden floods to the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and to the south of California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa will be expected to hang up on Phoenix Tuesday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of Phoenix 200 miles!
Katrina (1967) was an orange within 40 miles of the Arizona border.'
The latest models of the National Hurcane Center presuppose 5 to 10 centimetres down, with isolated quantities up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rome of Arizona.
Other parts of the south-west of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Lakes, will probably get rain 3 to 5 cm, and here and there are 10 cm possible.
For areas where there is no risk of overruns, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are very worrying, some of these rainfalls will probably be favourable because the southwestern is currently passing a dryer.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current drought areas are identified makes more than 40 per cent of Arizona at least extreme drought by the highest category,' reported weather.com.
The trail of Orkaan Rosa reaches the mainland via the Baja California coast in Mexico.
Rosa is still on the ground floor in Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north with a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific, which weakens them.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday or evening with the power of a tropical storm.
There may be high rainfall in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant risk of overflow.
‘Request of total 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the north west of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,’ reported weather.com.
Rosa moves north over Mexico as a tropical storm before she reaches the border with Arizona in the early eighth century as a tropical depression, which then leaves her in the middle of the night by Arizona and will be revealed in the south of Utah.
"The greatest danger that Rosa or her crew is expected to face is the severe rain fall in Baja California, the northwestern of Sonora, and the south-west of the desert area," said the National Hurricane Center.
These rain will be expected to result in sudden life-threatening floods and droughts in the deserts and earthquakes in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsumer Norton: four arrests on the memory of attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for attempting to kill after being found in Somerset.
The teenager was found on Saturday about 4 hours at local time in the Excelsior Terrace district in Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is 'stable'.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested last night in the Radstock area, so the police of Avon and Somerset were arrested.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed something about what happened to report.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'takes away from the community, the anger' of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the unbridled and scandalous tactic of the Democratic Party," said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during his appointment procedure, Kavanaugh continued to 'taken past among the community, the anger' of the Democratic Party
Kavanaugh witnessed Thursday for the Congress, and he gave strong and emotional attention to Christine Blasey Ford’s concern that he had engaged in sexual intercourse decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed during the hearing about her anxiety.
The president said on Saturday that the 'American people 'is 'a curious and incredible character, the quality and courage' of Kavanaugh saw that day.
"A vote to recognise Judge Kavanaugh, is a vote that recognises one of the most comprehensive legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent state of service," he told the numerous advocates in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican event in the interim elections.
“Five weeks are one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not taking part, but I'm actually taking part, he said.
'That's why I'm coming everywhere for great candidates.'
Trup stated that the Democrats are on a mission to "supply and stop us".
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will be expected to take place on Friday at the latest, a top-level GOP-leader told CNN.
Hundreds died by Indonesian earthquakes, tsunamis, and the toll continues to rise
At a large earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were displaced when giant waves fell on the beach, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people came for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves of really six meters high above the ground at the time it started to draw. Many people broke down and the waves destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They didn't leave immediately and became the victim of the tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, director of the Indonesian agency for assistance in natural disasters BNPB during a briefing in Jakarta.
'The tsunami also led to other dangers: he drove cars, tree trunks, houses, he hit everything on the ground,' said Nugroho, who added that the tsunami was traveling at a speed of 800 km/h over the open sea before reaching the coastal line.
Some people fall into a tree to escape from the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
On air photos released by the help agency in natural disasters it is seen that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges destroyed and destroyed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal town remained surrounded by raisins.
The number of earthquakes has been felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Implementation (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by the massive earthquake of Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that had occurred in Hiroshima during World War II.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long, small bay, has still increased the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘achievable’ and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were located.
Some deadly victims were stuck under the roof of destroyed buildings, he said. About 540 people were wounded and 29 were lost.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage could be even greater along the coastal line 300 km north of Palu, in a area called Dondhia, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication with Dodrea 'is completely flat, we have no information', Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live," said the Red Cross in a statement. The staff and volunteers of the Red Cross are on their way to the affected areas.
'It's already a tragedy, but it can be even worse,' said the Red Cross.
The organisation received a lot of criticism today because it had not said that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time the warning was given.
In amateur images shared on social media, it is to hear how a man on top of a building in panic to people down the street to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later a wall of water falls on the coast and is built and furnished with cars.
Reuters could not verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunamis caused a large flow of electricity that interrupted the communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending cargo aircraft with aids from Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but the evacuations still need food and other basic needs.
The airport of the city is only here for aid and remains closed for the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday.
Dodenol of Tsunami is rising above 800.
It's very bad.
Indeed, World Vision workers from Dodhea arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers at their office are looking for shelters in tents of dexel, but passing through flood stages, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses that were destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began with the difficult task of bringing relief, some complained that certain foreign aid providers could not travel to Palu with great skill.
According to the Indonesian regulations, funding, goods and staff from abroad can be granted only if the location of an accident is declared as a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
'It's still a provincial disaster,' said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
'As long as the government says, 'O.K., this is a national disaster', we can provide international assistance, but that status has not yet been invoked.'
When the second night after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday many on Palu, friends and family of the missing were hoping they would come back to their loved ones, as in the miracles that people like to hear in terrible natural disasters like these.
On Saturday, a young man was taken out of a rival.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped in the pit for two days with the appearance of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subannon, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had previously been located in Indonesia this month.
His students also stayed at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandanga.
"As a veteran in the paragliding world, I bring my own emotional burden," he said.
Dr. Gendon told us that the Roa Roa Roa Hotel was located in the paragliding community and that in the hours following, he had sent unexpected WhatsApp reports to the athletes in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
However, only one gray angle appears in his messages instead of two blue angles.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Dieves steal $26,750 while saving cash in Newport on the Level
On Friday morning, $26,750 was stolen from a worker from Brink who was filling a cash machine in Newport on the Level, according to a press report from the Newport police.
The driver had just put a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, as Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report.
When he was busy, another man ran from behind Brink's staff and stole a bag of money that was ready to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects, so the press report, but the police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
For information on the identity of the perpetrators, please contact the Newport police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name in Ye.
Last Saturday he announced the change to Twitter with the words ‘It was known as Kanye West’.
The 41-year-old West has been named Ye short road and used this name as the title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change was announced in the course of his work on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to propose his new Yandhi album.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who has cancelled her performance during the show for ‘emotional reasons’, says the director of the show.
He is not just a short summary of his current artist name. Rather, West told him that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think 'ye' is the most famous word in the Bible, and in the Bible means 'you', said West earlier this year, when he told about the title of his album to Radio Representative Big Boy.
‘But I am you, I am us, we are.
I'm overcome by Kanye, which means 'the only', to just you, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the crazy, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of who we are.'
He's not the only famous rapper who changed his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who worked with West before, has already worked with and without the link sign and the capital letters.
The President of Mexico does not promise to use force against citizens
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, promised never to use military power against citizens. The country is at the forefront of the 50th anniversary of a bloody repression against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelco Plaza that he would ‘never use military violence to oppress the Mexican people.’
On October 2, 1968, military forces fired at a peaceful uprising on the plain, killing 300 people. During the period left students were moved to Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by offering monthly grants to students and open more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs as a result of unemployment and lack of opportunities to study.
The United States must double the funding of A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount it spends on A.I. research, says the investor and A.I.-specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this because of the announcements about A.I. coming from various departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have a formal strategy for A.I..
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: by 2030, the country wants to be number 1 on the A.I. innovations.
'The budget for research to A.I. would already be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next break in A.I.' said Lee.
A duplication of funding may lead to a duplication of the possibility that the next major implementation of A.I. in the US will take place this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in Face++, one of China's major A.I. companies.
In the 1980s he worked in Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that was the best player of American Othello, and later he was manager at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese Google department.
Lee speaks out of appreciation for technological struggles organized by the American government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and early when the next fight would take place, because it would help to discover the next viewers.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, Lee said.
'China doesn't fit our best academics, the companies do that' said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have encouraged universities in recent years to work at A.I..
Lee said that the American efforts at the A.I. level would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
"How to do doctorate at A.I. would automatically have to get a green card," he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its development plan for artificial intelligence of the next generation in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences grants financial support to academic staff, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations pay to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, says Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence launched a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve partners from industry and the academic world in the initiative, and White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF currently invests more than $100 million in research to A.I.
However, the American legislation that should lead to the establishment of a national safety committee for artificial intelligence has been in silence for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on possible change in their country's names
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change in the name of their country in the 'North Republic of Macedonia', which would put an end to Greece which had been seized for decades and would no longer stop the Macedonian application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province also known as Macedonia, which says that the name of its northern neighbour holds the country's address in the Greek territory, and Greece has therefore submitted its veto against the entry of Macedonia into the European Union and NATO.
In June, the two authorities concluded an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalists found that the change in names would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he did not vote in the referendum and that through a boycott campaign it is not sure that the required arrival will be at least 50%, so that the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the ballot was formulated as follows: ‘Are you a supporter of the NATO and the EU membership with the agreement with Greece?’
‘Protestors of the change in names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, find that the price to be paid is worth trying to be a member of institutions such as the EU and NATO.
'I am today voting for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us, said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have indicated that they will respect the outcome by which they are determined.
Before the name changes, a second demarcation in Parliament would be required.
The National Electoral Commission said that there were no reports of irregularities at 13 hours.
However, only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent during the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
'I come to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe, said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, an elector in the capital of Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Struca, Macedonia, during the referendum on the change in the name of the country that would open the way for NATO and the European Union membership.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small podium in front of the Parliament in Skopje and placed it in front of tents that were placed by people who made the referendum boycott.
"We are the supporters of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, not through a rear gate," Kavadarkov said.
‘We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.'
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO's membership will deliver food investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
'I am convinced that the vast majority is advocates, because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are advocates of the EU and NATO,' Zaev said after voting.
He said that a 'yes' as a result would be 'a confirmation of our future'.
An opinion published last month by the Macedonian Institute for Guidance Research showed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required event.
From another painting, carried out by the Macedonian TV station Telma TV, it was concluded that 57 per cent of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of that would be the vote.
If the referendum is to be successful, it must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-western government's policy since it came into force in May last year.
Look at: Sergio Aguero van Manchester City is in full defense of Brighton and short
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made short matches with the defence of Brighton in the Ethihad Stadium in the English Manchester City. Manchester City won the battle with 2-0.
It looked like a flight of a cent, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian Spit first got the ball played on the middle floor.
He raced between three Brighton defenses, right into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He knew how to pass a defense and was too fast for some others at the border of Brighton's criminal district.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English attacker used his first action in the penal area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right-wing sword to punish the target man Matthew Ryan with a shot at the right side of the net.
‘Aguero has been loaded with problems with his feet,’ said coach Pep Guardiola of Manchester City to the press.
‘We decide to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he was cutting a ball right now.'
But it was Sterling that Sky Blues gave the first advantage in the Premier League.
That's what happened in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in Brighton's playground.
He sent a beautiful stick pass along the left-hand side to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball for a while and then sent Sterling to the second floor.
The Sky Blues player picked up the ball just before he was too far away.
The city takes the Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. against Hoffenheim in the champions League's group phase. The competition takes place in the Rhine-Neckar-Arena in the German Sinsheim.
The screensaver wants to play and does not make the Rockies easy to reach the play-off
Now the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the play-off, there was little reason to force a new start.
However, the always competitive Scherzer hopes to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are any consequences for the participation of the Rockies in the playoff. They are currently one match for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least a wild card for the play-off thanks to their 5-2 victory against the Nationals last Friday, but they still want to put everything in place to ensure their first title.
“Although there is nothing more in it for us, at least we can point out with the science that the sphere here in Denmark will be optimal with this audience and the other team will probably play at the highest level that I would come this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in there?'
The Nationals still have to announce who will be present on Sunday, but they are inclined to set up Scherzer as a pitter in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, stood on Thursday in the courtyard and would still pick the next Sunday, although it is usually his rest day.
The right-wing editor of Washington is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 in this season.
Trump organizes a meeting in West Virginia
The President referred directly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while speaking about the importance of the Republican event in the interim elections.
‘All we have already fulfilled is in November on the game.
Five weeks is one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the really big choices, I don't participate, but I actually do, so I come everywhere for great candidates,' he said.
Trump continued: ‘We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they're determined to take the power back into their hands, regardless of what they have to do for it.
It doesn't make them suffer, they have to remove them to get power and control, that's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them.'
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to 'offer resistance and stop us'.
'And we've seen that over the past four days,' he said, calling the Democrats 'good and bad and bad and lying'.
He named the name of the Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, appointed in the Senate Commission for Justice, which led to a loud appeal from the public.
‘Do you know what she answered?
Have you read the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body steel, the worst body steel I've ever seen.'
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant for people who say what they think
When the activists of Momentum voted in my local party to censor me, that was no surprise.
Finally, I am the newest in a whole series of Members of the Labour Parliament who have to get that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague, Mr Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because they had resolved against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motion for censorship because I wasn't with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, is ironic enough similar issues like this in which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Nottingham East Labour conference on Friday, we said: ‘We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.’
And that was also the case during most GC meetings on Friday night during the eight years that I am already a local member of the Labour Parliament.
Unfortunately, today it is not the show of many meetings and is the promise of a 'more tenderer, sweeter' politician for a long time, if they had ever begun.
It is becoming more and more clear that a separate opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is assessed whether it is acceptable for the party's guidance or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues who had a similar political perspective as far as I was concerned were expected to make a change and take a position I would never have agreed with otherwise, on issues such as national security to the European Union market.
As far as I speak to a public, as I say, there are social media parties calling for the withdrawal of my candidate as a member of Parliament for the following elections, where the policy of the centre is put on the cake and I am told that I could not be a member of the Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
In fact, I know that I am happier than some of my fellow Members, because the comments to my address on general politics are.
I am under the impression of the professionality and determination of those colleagues who have a daily impact on sexual or racist reactions, but do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period of policy is that very divided parties appear to be considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer those broad churches and with every ‘moment of mistrust’ or change of electoral rules, the party becomes smaller.
For the past two years, I have often received advice to keep my mind occupied, not just to express my opinion and then I would 'not come into trouble'.
But I didn't go to politics for that.
Since I was a member of the Labour school 32 years ago, tried by the neglect of the Thatcher government by which my class office literally collapsed, I have always provided better public services for those they need most, both in my role as a congregation council member and in my role as a minister.
I have never kept my politics hidden, nor in the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my political positions and my disputes with the current leadership.
I can only say one thing to those who have proposed the motion on Friday: when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will damage families, companies and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I have only one message, and that is not directed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are now members of Labour or not: I am proud of you and I promise that threats to my candidate as a member of Parliament for the following elections or political opportunities will not prevent me from acting according to what I think is in your interest.

Year 38 - 17 Melrose: Unsolved Air on the way to the top
Two late three's may have drawn the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr rightly triumphs in this glorious battle of the day in the Tenent's Premiership.
They're now on top of the class, the only inconsistencies team of the ten.
Finally, it was their superior defense and their better chances of winning the house, and coach Peter Murchie could have been satisfied.
"We have had it ever since it was difficult during our fighting and we are still in despair, so I am a happy man," he said.
Robyn Christie van Melrose: 'All honor Ayr, they have their chances better than we.'
Grant Anderson's trial in the 14th minute, led by Frazier Climo, led to a premier for Ayr, but through a yellow map of Rory Hughes of the Scottish National Arrow (which he received during the Warriors' fight) Melrose was able to speak the figures and Jason Baggot was able to break a trick in it.
Climo provided a penulty for an extra source for Ayr and cut a conversion after a solotry just for the rest. So it was 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half good and Patrick Anderson's trick, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the origin to five points.
The battle took a long time quiet for a serious blessing from Ruaridh Knott, who was carried out on a brandy, and as soon as the battle started again, Ayr could continue to run by a trip from Stafford McDowell followed by a conversion from Climo.
Then the carrier Blair Macpherson of Ayr received a yellow card, and again counting Melrose with the extra man, when no conversion followed a trick of Bruce Colvine at the end of a contest where the pressure was very high.
However, the job came back, and when Sruan Hutchinson received a yellow card because he took Climo without the ball, MacPherson took care of the rising Ayr-moul for a touchdown at the penulty-line out.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did that almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe rebooted David Armstrong's box kicking and half back Gregor Henry left for the fifth trireme of the house.
Ster of Still Game is ready for new careers in the restaurant world
It appears that Actor Ford Kieran from Still Game is in the Horeca. Apparently he is appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, where he writes and acts with his comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
The duo announced that the coming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan's life after Craiglang is already on the agenda.
According to official data, he is the Director of Operationsormord Limited.
The actor didn't want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun lets you know that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the 'bloody restaurant business' in Glasgow.
'The sea is of us': the Bolivian border hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific.
Seeui patrols in a year-old dressed marine office in La Paz.
On public buildings, an ocean blue flag is used.
On every seabed from the Titicacameer to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is ours.
It's a duty to win them back.'
In all the country around Bolivia, the memory of the coastal line that the country has had to endure after a bloody 19-year-old commodity conflict in Chile is still alive, just as it needs to be preserved in the Pacific.
This hope may have reached its highest point in the last decade, as Bolivia is waiting for an international Court of Justice, which should be consulted on 1 October after five years.
"Bolivia has the moment, a spirit of unity and serenity, and naturally looks at positive prospects for the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will look at the Court of Justice's statement on large screens, hoping that the Court of Justice in the Hague will be in favour of Bolivia, and that Chile, after decades of poor discussions, is obliged to give Bolivia a sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia, who is next year in the midst of a controversial re-election struggle, is very much at stake with the speech of Monday.
‘We stand very close to the return to the Pacific,’ he said late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide in favour of Bolivia, and even if it was, it would change little.
The UN body established in the Netherlands does not have the authority to recognise the Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the International Court of Justice has only six months after the closure indicates that the case was 'not complicated', says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive outcome of Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the other hand, in the past four years, the situation may even have become worse.
"The case about access to the sea is purchased by the current Bolivian government," Zárate said.
The warlike retourism of Morales has all the good wishes that Chile may still have had in mind, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their discussions at a certain time, but it will be extremely difficult to speak up next.
The two countries have not been embassies in each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, who represents Bolivia in the Hague, refuses to take the decision of the court immediately.
Today, Bolivia will have ‘a unique opportunity to start a new period of international relations with Chile’ and an opportunity to ‘end at 139 years of differences of opinion, with mutual advantages’, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, which is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, uses the maritime issue as a political framework.
'Bolivia will never grant its right to access to the Pacific,' he added.
'The statement is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind us.'
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is possible only if the US can trust
The North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never eliminate its nuclear weapons if Washington cannot be trusted.
Today, Ri speaks at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to follow the promises made during a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the time that State Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be about to start the ongoing nuclear diplomacy again, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says that it is a 'toopie' that the continued sanctions and the US challenge against a declaration that the Korean war will end, North Korea will never get on its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the statement without the first important steps taken by Pyongyang on the level of disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is scepticism, and there is doubt that Pyongyang is serious if he says that he would turn away from an arsenal that the country is likely to see as his own way of guaranteeing his safety.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Modeshows in Paris discovers the latest collection of huge headlines, soon to buy at you in the neighborhood
If you want to expand your collection or keep the sun completely out of your eyes, then don't seek further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne discovered a series of overcrowded headpieces for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a remarkable set during the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer was not to be taken away from Instagram, and these designers have sent the catwalk on their blindfolding creatures.
The striking piece of Valentino was a giant bead decorated with a four-dimensional edge that hangs over the eyes of the models.
Other overcrowded accessories were watermelons with precious stones, a towel, and even ananas, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also discovered a selection of strange masks, just in time for Halloween.
In many of the colorful masks, the lips were close together. They look more like Hannibal Lecter than on skin texture.
The one creature looked like a duke, complete with snorkel and glasses, while the other looked like a frozen egg.
And if you want to follow this corrupt mode, you're lucky.
Steywachers predict that the huge guards will find their way to the clothing shops near you.
The giant guards may have been inspired by 'La Bomba', the streams have a two-metre wide edge that drives everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The Cultlabel behind the very inactivative attitude that was found everywhere on social media also provided another great creation on the catwalk: a streamy beach bag that was almost as large as the model in the bathroom that carried the bag.
The red orange raffia bag, cut off with raffia francs and worked with a white lead ring, was the most striking piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told the FC: 'I expect to see big summers and beach waves in the shops. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the question of extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent state of service in the field of academic excellence, and in 2018, this has again resulted in a number of excellent exams, and in addition, individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other initiatives of the whole community.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are aimed at providing the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for continued and higher education, the path they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As a educational sector that can design and implement a designed schoolcurriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desired in excellent schools.
Nelson Mandela said: ‘If you speak to someone in a language he understands, then you reach his head.
When you talk to him in his own language, you reach his heart.'
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's examination, we can conclude that languages are above the range list, with the highest percentages in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages had a high score.
The data collected from 74 schools at SCIS show that 72% of students received a high score ('A') in Mandarin, while 72% of the students in Germany, 69% of the students in France, and 63% of the students in Spain also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that will undoubtedly require children and young people in the future.
Languages are now valued as professional also as STEM subjects (scientific science, technology, technology and science) in independent school programs and others.
A study by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the obstacles to fill vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills, according to employers.
Language skills thus become increasingly important to prepare young people for their future careers.
Now more and more vacancies require linguistic expertise, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Despite the career one chooses, if he has learned a second language, in the future he has a real advantage with such skill for life.
Direct communication with people from abroad automatically leads to competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 per cent was unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation. France was the only language that exceeded 10 per cent, with a total of 15 per cent.
This is why investing in language education is now important for today's children.
A number of languages can be spoken, especially those of emerging economies, offer children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools themselves choose which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach the most important languages for the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as the Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest is, there will always be different languages to choose in independent schools, with teachers specialized in this area.
Bad independent schools are involved in providing an education that prepares children and gives them the skills they need to succeed regardless of the future.
It cannot be denied that languages remain vital in a global business environment for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You need to do it.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Sunday his debut at the Lakers in San Diego
Fans waiting for LeBron James's first battle at the Los Angeles Lakers, waiting is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening competition on Sunday before the season against the dinner Nuggets in San Diego.
There is still a need to determine how many minutes he will play.
"There will be more than one, and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James will probably play a limited number of minutes.
After the training this week, James was asked for his plans for the Lakers scheme for the six competitions prior to the season.
"At this stage of my career, I do not need to fight before the season to prepare for me," he said.
Period of electoral rallys from Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, to a long series of elections
It is the first of five planned rallys of Trump in the coming week, including stops in places that have taken him, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now the vote on the appointment of the candidate for the vacancy in the Supreme Court is expected to be supported by Trump for the forthcoming interim elections, because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress in November.
How often does Trump's rally start in West Virginia tonight and how do you look online?
The trip rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018, at 19 p.m.
You can visit Trumps rarely in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trup will probably have the hearings for candidate-right Brett Kavanaugh this week. They were extra loaded now Kavanaugh is charged with sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait for a week to vote on his appointment, while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main aim of this series is to help the republics that are candidates for the elections in November to get more elan.
President Trump's campaign leader said that these five rallys were meant in the coming week to "inspired volunteers and supporters, while the republics are trying to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and House of Representatives," Reuters said.
'Control over the Congress is so important for its programme, that the president to as many states as possible is now starting the busy campaign season,' said a spokesman from the Trump campaign who did not want to be mentioned on behalf of Reuters.
The rally tonight in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in Pittsburgh media, said West Virginia Metro News.
Today, the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the ranks.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost in the matches," said Simon Haeder, political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is ready to fight to keep the hope alive in the race to Sunday's singles
After three separate sessions, Friday morning’s foursomes were probably just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The slammer of chance is a fully developed sport concept, but a real player really believes, especially in competitions like this.
So who's gonna get the best chances right now?
'They had first one origin of six points, and now it's only four more, so we find so little that happiness is on our side,' Jordan Spieth said before him at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of being four points, while there are still twelve points in the game.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each three points of the four.
Spieth is a very scary opponent from tea to green and he sets the good example.
The typical bell sounds that he did when he played well became more louder with his round forwards and he made a crucial pout with which fighting was four success when he and Thomas stood two points behind two battles.
His poem with which she won the competition on 15 won, was followed by a similar script, the kind that you can conclude from which he believes the American team has not been reported yet.
'You have to dig deep and make yourself worried about your own game' said Spieth.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the incredible story of the Ryder Cup.
This is remarkable, but beautiful European customs have four to four and can do nothing wrong.
‘Molywood’ was the only duo that Saturday morning played no bogey, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning avoid bogey'ss.
As a result of this series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their Romanian audience, they are the players who should be reported on Sunday.
In the case of two separate holes, the preferred two are at the same time.
It is, however, too, too early to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short matches with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a backdrop for the Spaniard and the Swedish that they did not come up anymore.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get your back.
The four balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and the way in which a strategy can change in a perspective.
So far, the European team has played the best and has a good lead in the course of the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that the US team is ready to go to war, something that some, especially in the US, have doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe begins with a beautiful spring on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and four-days of Saturday they stand in 10-6 for the United States.
The respective duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, which was difficult, and now they have four points in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjørn, who wanted to return the trophies they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, was stronger than the burning Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance in the foursomes, where the two fighting won, but his resistance could no longer contain.
Jim Furyk's team must score eight points during the 12 single-day sun fight to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first European novelist to win four points, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname ‘Molliwood’ after a sentimental weekend, are the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup that four points win in their four opening contests.
After they had incorporated Woods and Patrick Reed into the four-balls, they were wonderfully played on each other and they shot a devastating Woods and American novelist Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who himself fought by two competitions this Saturday, left off and saw a striking sight, but he now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and four-sooms and seven on row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of 'morning morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world, with 2&1.
However, it did not fall from a false roof for Europe on this pleasant day with a bridge in the southwestern part of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has three times lived by the Major, and Justin Thomas put the standard for Americans on Saturday with three points.
They won a difficult battle with 2&1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It has just happened two times in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team can have a back-up of four points at the beginning of the singles, although the Furyk team has enough to play at the same time, since they currently have the trophies in their hands.
But now that they've been in second place for two days, it looks like an attack is too high on Sunday.
North Korea says 'no' will be fired alone without confidence
The US Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations today that the continued sanctions would increase confidence in the United States and that the country would not be able to release its nuclear weapons separately under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN Annual General Meeting that in the past year, North Korea had experienced ‘important goodwill measures’, such as the halting of nuclear and rocket tests, the detonation of the location for nuclear tests and the promise of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
‘We see no consistent response from the US,’ he said.
'Without any confidence in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not, in any case, disarm each other.'
Although Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a 'phased' approach to denuclearization, which would be rewarded with further steps, it is very likely that he did not give priority to unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang did earlier.
Ri refers to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first summit between an active American president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on the ‘dynuclarization of the Korean landscape’, while Trump promised security guarantees of North Korea.
North Korea seeks a formal end to the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang should first release his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed its call for severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. pushes on 'denuclearization first' and increases the pressure by means of sanctions to achieve their objective in a strong way and even by protesting against the 'declaration of the end of war'," said Ri.
‘The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is an air castle of people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions only strengthen our confidence.'
Ri did not report plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something that the American leader had already opened in the week with the United Nations.
The Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: ‘If the other party in this issue of nuclearization was South Korea and not the U.S., the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been such an impasse.’
However, Ri's speech was significantly different than last year, when he told the General Assembly of the United Nations that it was inevitable that North Korean rockets on the American mainland were directed after ‘Mr. Evil President’ Trump Kim called a 'racetman’ on a suicide mission.
Trup, who threatened to destroy North Korea completely last year, promised this year to the United Nations to take his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that there must be a lot to do and that the sanctions must continue to denuclearize North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time schedule for this: ‘If it's two years, three years or five months, that doesn't work.’
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council has to pay for the steps taken.
The U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, told the UN Security Council on Thursday: 'The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue strong and stable until we have carried out the complete, definitive, verified denuclearization.'
Since 2006, the Security Council has implemented uniform sanctions against North Korea to significantly reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo, outside the UN General Assembly, had a meeting with Ri and said he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not well.
Nearly a few hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said there was progress, North Korea mentioned him from setting out 'gangsterly requirements'.
North Korea promised this month during a meeting with Moon to disintegrate a rocket site and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take ‘compliant measures’.
He said Kim had told him that the ‘agreement measures’ he wanted were security guarantees that the Trip had granted in Singapore, and steps in the direction of normalisation of relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard follow a course on the importance of adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an attempt to fight the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night and drink a lot of caffeine.
One professor concluded that students of the world's largest university often have no idea of basic principles to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a leading sleep doctor at Harvard Medical School, was a specialist associated with the Brigham and Women's Hospital, setting up the course. For how he knows this is unique in the U.S.
He got the idea to start with the course after giving a talk about the influence of sleep failure on learning.
'At the end of my speech, a girl came to me and said, 'Why do I just hear this in my last year?'
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me," he said against The Telegraph.
In this course, which is first organized this year, students are told the basic principles of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a senior psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was established that students had a serious sleep disorder during the week.
The course lasts one hour and contains a number of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts, the students see a picture of a sleeping room where they click on coffee cups, vegetables, exercise equipment and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and the way sports performance are affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a routine when sleeping.
In another part, participants are told how long-term sleep loss increases the risk of heart failure, stroke, depression and cancer.
Through a platform of the campus, with interactive pictograms, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
‘We know that we will not change the conduct of the students immediately.
But we find that they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know what the choice of cigarettes has to do with their health, Czeisler added.
The culture of pride on a night of students is still there, he says, and through modern technology and increasing pressure on students, sleep loss is a growing problem.
In order for adequate sleep, of good quality, the student’s ‘secret weapon’ must be to fight stress, fatigue and fear, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, as sleep deprivation ensures that the brain gives them a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to establish the course. He had always studied at the high school when he studied at Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make sure that the course was available for everyone on the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study programme before they come to the competition institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set up an alarm for their bedtime, not just a alarm to stand up. They should also be aware of the harmful effects of the 'blue light' of electronics and light-lights, which can trigger your circadian rhythm, which makes it difficult for you to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's target makes Gerrard's men go down
The Rangers saw their exhilarating battle over again when Dolly Menga jumped and the weak foot of Steven Gerrard landed with 1-0 in Livingstone.
The outbreak of Ibrox hoped for a first victory during an outbreak in February of St Johnstone with 4--1, but Gary Holt's strike took place in the fall, almost the second of Gerarrd as manager in 18 wars. It is now eight points behind Hearts, which will continue to run at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Many scored in seven minutes for the rest, and the Rangers didn't succeed to score the equalizer.
The Rangers are now heading to the sixth place, Livingston is rising to the third, with only a difference in a number of waves compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could have even more problems, as border lawyer Calum Spence had to be treated for a major strike after apparently being thrown to him by the visitor's supporters.
Gerard made eight changes through his bed. They're standing by Ayr and going to half the finals of the Betfred Cup.
He remained at the same eleventh for Livingstone, which the Hearts knew a point of falling off last week. He would have been raised in the way his well-trained mind was able to block the opponents at each set of stars.
The Rangers may have had most of them, but Livingston did more.
They had already had to score after two minutes, when Menga took off the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in the tour, but the midfielder couldn't close it.
A deep free foot of Keaghan Jacobs reached the leader Craig Halkett, but his colleague-protected Alan Lithgov shot at the back of the ball.
The Rangers were able to take control over it, but instead they seemed to hope for a good outcome than they really believed in it if they were able to reach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos found in any case that he was entitled to a criminal case when he and Steven Lawless were playing a quarter of the boxing, but divorce lawyer Steven Thomson refused the request of the Colombians.
The Rangers could only shoot at the target two times in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was a former target at the Ibrox, was able to stop Lassana Coulibaly's headball and Ovie Ejaria's stupid shot with ease.
The opener of Livingston in the 34th minute must not be allowed to sit in the length of the general game, no one can deny that they deserve this, even though it was only for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were not raised against Jacobs' deep game pattern.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cold-blooded and chose Menga, who took the ball with ease in the target.
Gerrard provided for a break with the Coulibaly/Ryan Kent exchange. This had almost immediate consequences when the fly player Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly race from his line to keep the ball against.
But Livingston continued to urge visitors to play a kind of fight that Livingston loves to play, where Lithgow and Halkett have long played ball.
The team of Holt could have increased its momentum in the final phase of the battle, but McGregor kept a good stand and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgov spread from the corner.
Invaller Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked at the end of the fight for a criminal chief after an arrest with Jacobs, but Thomson looked at the other side.
German: the discoverer of the Gegitterler
And now a page from the almanac of our 'Sday Morning': 30 September 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for whom can TELLEN... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm ‘Hans’ Geiger was born in Germany.
Rather, it developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device with the name triggerer.
Since then, it has not been far from science, and in the pop culture it has also been an icon, for example in 'Bells or Coronado', a 1950 film with the first appearance of unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that in God's name?"
Rogers: ‘It's a geyser. It's used to track radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you set this main phone, you hear the effect of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals.'
Evans: 'It's really the kid now!'
‘Hans’ Geiger died in 1945, almost a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But the invention bearing his name remains relevant.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ harmful cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ and kill harmful cells
Vaccin teaches immune system to detect harmful cells during treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells in a patient to modify them in a lab.
They can then see an egg that is often present in many types of cancer and are then re-injected.
A test vaccine produces promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify harmful cells saw her egg cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method removes immune cells from a patient, where cells in the lab are adjusted so that they can ‘see’ the cells again, which often occur in different types of cancer.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "From our results it seems that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of various types of cancer’, including breast cancer, kidney cancer, lung cancer and dynamite cancer, Professor Berzofsky said.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and to ‘learn’ these cells to collect cancer cells was previously used in the treatment of a certain type of leukaemia.
Kanye West slows down pro-Trup time and turns MAGA-pet after its appearance in Saturday Night Live.
That's not as he hoped.
Kanye West was welcomed during a Saturday Night Live broadcast after an inconsistencies in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would be presidential candidate in 2020.
After he had brought his third night number, Ghost Town, with his head a poem with the text Make America Great Again, he broke a tie against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
‘Look, when I speak to a white person, he asks, ‘How can you now feel for Trump? He is a racist!’
When I was worried about racism, I had been away from America for a long time, he said.
The issue of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood sister Matt Damon accused him of breaking up with the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Commission for Justice in connection with the related appeal that Christine Blasey Ford accused him of.
The thirade of West was not sent out, but comic Chris Rock posted it on social media.
It's not clear whether Rock and his post want to hang out with West.
West also complained against the public that he had been taken back by fire to his pet.
‘They have shaken me backstage.
They said, "Don't stop on the podium with that pet."
They've upset me!
And then they say I'm apathic, he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see how apathically it looks?’ He said he would draw them superman-cape, ‘because that means you can’t order me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love.'
From the audience came a call at least two times and the SNL Castel members seemed to be honored, according to Variety. The magazine was received from an audience: ‘The whole studio was quite quiet.’
West was to host as a last-minute replacement of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend, rapper Mac Miller, a few days ago was dead.
West surprised many with the execution of the number I Love it while he was dressed as Perrier-Flight.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who said the second: ‘On one of our bravest dreams: BEDANCE OF THE MASSA TROTSEERT.’
But talkshow-presenter Karen Hunter second that the West was just ‘generally self, and that's beautiful.’
‘But I choose to reward someone who supports and exploits an ideology that damages my community (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do what he wants.
So did we. She added.
Before the show started, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on, he says, ‘it was to be that formally known as Kanye West’.
He's not the first artist to change his name, he was passed by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dog has also played the name Snoop Lion and the last musical prince has ever changed his name in a symbol and then in The Artist formally known as Prince.

The complaint will be examined by the Ministry of Public Affairs.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington comes from toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as heavyweighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game or Thrones of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor comes from the stereotype of the machoheld and says that young boys often think they should be proud to be respected.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he thinks ‘something is wrong’ and asked himself how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during #MeToo.
Kit, recently married to his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, gave him strong conviction that the problem should be addressed.
'This is a really important question for me personally at the moment: where is the misunderstanding with our masculinity?' he said.
'What have we learned from men when they grow, why are we now faced with this problem?'
Kit thinks that television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic gender, by its very male characters.
He said, "What is born, and what is raised up?"
What is happening on TV and on the street why young people think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of the big questions today: how do we change that?
'Cause there's clearly something wrong with young men.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not act in prequequels or sequences of Games or Thrones if the series is over the next summer, because he is ‘clear with arrows and horses’.
Since November, Kit plays with him in a Revival of True West of Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is superior.
The actor recently discovered that he finds that his meeting with his wife Rose is the best result of Game of Thrones.
'I've met my wife during the series, so that way I have kept my future family and my life from now on,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kits character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was crowned with an Emmy.
The team was married in June 2018 at the village of Leslies family in Scotland.
Hiv/aids: China reports a 14% rise in new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 82 000 people have been hit by it in the country.
Only 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were passed through sex, which was not so before.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through transfusions of contaminated blood.
But the number of people who run this way is now almost zero, Chinese health workers said during a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared with the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people in China.
The transfer of HIV via sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been criminal in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has become widespread.
According to studies, 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
The disease is often transmitted by inadequate protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine in the context of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses that staff member has posted data from Republican senators and is derived from ‘hazardous lies’ and ‘compulsory theories’
The American Congress of Maxine Waters is against the charges that one of its staff has placed the personal data of three U.S. senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles claims that the charges are spread by “extremely” tweets and websites.
‘ Lies, lies, and even more fake lies,’ said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private and private phone number of American Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared online on Thursday. They were posted by an unknown in Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate Commission on the charges of sexual misconduct at the address of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate judge for the Supreme Court.
The scene came after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address that indicated the source of the mail was linked to the Waters office and contained information from a Waters employee, said the Hill.
"This baseless charge is completely false and a flying lie," said Waters.
‘My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false accusations, was not responsible for the information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flaming lie.'
Waters' statement has already stopped running online on criticism, including by former persmedist of the White House Ari Fleischer.
'This denial sounds bad,' wrote Flescher.
‘Here you can explain that she does not have the temperature to be Congress.
If a person is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
He doesn't have to get up.
He must not question the motives of the accused.
He must remain calm and serene.'
Flescher appears to compare the response of Waters with the criticism of the Democrats on the right of Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive wickedness during the Thursday session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take over Waters in the interim elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
'Superious, if it's true' he's second.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had brought up the relevant services and enforcement agencies with these false charges.
'We will ensure that the dads are known,' she said, 'and that they are legally held responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff.'
Review: Johnny English Strings Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In each new film with a British impression, we are now traditionally looking for references to Brexit, and that seems to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comical action films with a sleepy spy in the capital, which started with Johnny English in 2003 and was called back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this airy self-sustainment about how bad we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with revealing eyes and flexible facial features is in any case able to send everything in the hundredth, even with his second comeback. On his name, you can already see that he is a general comical character that has been viewed for bioscopic passengers in countries where one speaks a language other than English.
He's obviously the stupid secret agent who, despite his strange approach to smooth glamour, a little Clouseau, a flying Mr. Bean and a clue to that guy who had one need to contribute to the Chariots's of Fire during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
He was originally based on the traveler and the international mystery man Atkinson who ever played in Barclaycard's TV spots (for whom everyone was forgotten) who always left behind a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I found the beautiful way Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval weaponry and the rotor leaves just toward his helmet.
Atkinson can show well in this film how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor is too weak and is too excessive, especially now the "relative" film series like 007 and Mission Impossible itself contains comedy as ingredients, and it does well.
Rather, the humor seems to be meant for children than for adults, and Johnny English's deep disaster comes to me less original and focused on the jokes without the text of the character Bean that Atkinson plays.
The constant theme is now that Great Britain is traveling in great difficulties.
A cyberhacker has filtered the super secret spy network on the web, making it known the identity of all the active secret agents of Great Britain, to the great disengagement of the agent in function, a miserable little role of Kevin Eldon.
That's the drum that the mayor is making over the first minister, a pretentious woman with problems with her head and very unpopulated as a politician. Emma Thompson does her best with this character she thinks of Teresa May, but the script does not offer much material to work with.
According to her information advisors, they must install a retired spy, as each active spy is compromised.
And that means the present-day Johnny English himself, who now works as a school teacher in a chique institution, but unofficial lesson about sub-covering. Here are nice jokes in the story, because the English-readings are thinking about school or Rock.
English is quickly released on Whitehall for a emergency and restored with its former magic help Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is the captain of a subsoil, an untidy and young role that lies below the level of Vicki Pepperdines.
So the Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action and Olga Kurylenko's blood-mooyed five fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the first minister congratulates the charms of the charismatic technology miller who claims to be able to solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of clumsy dolls pret: dressed as masters they dig a careful French restaurant in fire, they make a hero on board the luxury hunt of Volta and English reject pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to make himself trusted with the interior of Volta's house.
For the latter, all registers are withdrawn, but as well as well as the scene is well meant and unsatisfied, they do what they think about children's television.
It's not all very original.
And just like Johnny English's other films, I wonder: can the British film sector really not think of any role that affects the talent of Rowan Atkinson?
Work refuses that the party is planning to work four days a week, but it will be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would consider a radical plan where Britain works four days a week, but it will be paid for five days.
According to the hearing, the party would like to provide the basis of companies with the savings they make as a result of the Revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to their employees by giving them an extra day's vacation.
This is how workers can enjoy a three-day weekend, but still earn a lot.
According to sources, the idea in the economic agenda of the party and the plans to take over the balance of the country is in the direction of the workers.
The transition to a four-day work week has already been approved by the Association of Trade Unions, which is a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A top source from the Labour Party said against The Sunday Times: ‘A policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not take place at the same time, but a four-day work week is a goal that is appropriate in the efforts of the party to increase the balance in the economy for the benefit of the workers, and also in the overall industrial strategy of the party."
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, since the Green Party has already promised a four-day work week in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the effort is not yet supported by the full Labour Party.
A speaker from the Labour Party said: "A quarter-day work week is not a party's policy and is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take the power back from the 'visible drivers' and 'profiters' at the utility companies.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not be able to recover the full value of their share, as a Labour Government could apply 'shorts' on the basis of observed vowel conduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to hire employees in the management councils of companies and to raise inclusive ownership funds (Including Owning Funds) with 10 per cent of the shares of firms from the private sector to employees that can earn up to £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' or the FBI investigation to Kavanaugh can change their mind
The FBI's investigation of charges against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has a definitive vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the FBI's findings could ensure that the Republican senators withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview sent on Sunday at '60 Minutes', Scott Pelley was early corresponding to the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI to find out something that might lead to their change of opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open here than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said before the hearing that I had spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolved, determined, unambiguous."
But Graham's voice seems to stand still.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the charge should contain dynamism," he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has strongly rejected it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"No one named by her could verify it.
It's 36 years ago.
I don't see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to the reduction of poverty?
This Saturday is organized in New York at the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up will take place and a very impressive mission is known: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time, tens of thousands of people will come to the Global Citizen Festival at the Great Lawn Central Park. Not only to enjoy events like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real goal: ending extreme poverty for 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, previously organised in 2012, is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting here.
Contestants who wanted to make a free card for the event (as long as they were willing to pay for a VIP card) had to complete a number of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteer work, a world leader e-mail, a phone call, or another significant way to generate awareness for the purpose: an end to poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with another 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert an appropriate way to convince people to call for action or is it just another form of 'klivism', people feel that they make a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, more than 19 million 'actions' have been registered by supporters, which have focused on a large number of different objectives.
According to Global Citizens, these actions have contributed to the involvement of world leaders and have made policy proposals worth more than $37 billion to change the lives of 2.25 billion people before 2030.
Early in 2018, the Group cited 390 initiatives and declarations based on actions, of which at least $10 billion has been paid or brought together by sponsorships.
The group estimated that the funds received thus far had an impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
The main intentional statements of The Power of Nutrition are a partnership of investors and executives from the United Kingdom with the aim of helping children realize their full potential.
"With the help of the British government, donors, other national authorities and Global Citizens as we can from the social injustice that is under investigation, make a note in history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, the public during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions were sent in which the British government was asked to improve the food situation for mothers and children, the government announced a project, the Power of Nutrition, to support 5 million women and children with food interventions.
In response to one of the many questions on the Global Citizen website in which was asked, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The group said, “It will be a long and difficult path for us to fall down and fall down.”
But, just like civil rights and anti-participation movements before us, we will eventually be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are a few of the artists who will take place this year during the New York event presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can set the sea for a 'blocked' to prevent Russian energy exports - Minister of Home Affairs
Washington can 'if necessary' take refuge in the sea to prevent Russian energy from coming into the market, including in the Middle East, declared Ryan Zinke, the US Minister for Home Affairs, as stated by the Washington Examiner.
Zink claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where the country acts at the invitation of the legal government, is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, just as in Eastern Europe and the southern part of Europe," he said.
And according to the officials, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States has this opportunity, with the sea, to make sure that the rails remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy is not on the market," he said.
A few words for those who attended an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profiting themselves as the 'vote of energy consumption' in the U.S.
He went further and compared Washington's approach to Russia with Iran's approach and noted that these did not differ significantly.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is less or more to use and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a country which knows but a 'art', with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump government is trying to encourage the export of liquid gas to Europe and replace Russia with a country that offers European consumers the most affordable option.
For that reason, officials from the government of Trump, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the 'inadequate' pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trum of Berlin, has made Moscow's 'prison'.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, which will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is only due to economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we agree with the belief that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves," said Aleksandr Novak, the Russian Minister for Energy Affairs, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the American Energy Minister, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has put an end to Germany's reaction, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Federal Federation of German Industry (BDI), the recognised industrial organisation in Germany, called on the US not to try to deal with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third option is struggling with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Federation of German Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thinks Seriously About' to take part in the presidential elections in 2020, says Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, Senator from Massachusetts, said today that she was "serious about thinking" to participate in the presidential elections after the mid-term elections.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she thought about participating in the elections.
"It is time for women to go to Washington to restore the corrupt government, and this also means a woman in the top position," she said in the political news sheet The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will think seriously about making me elected as President."
Warren ran against President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting and said he "sends this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm still disappointed on the boat what Donald Trump brings into our democracy," she said.
Warren was open-ended in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we should wait for an FBI investigation before we vote on it."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own contribution was not to be selective in 2020.
Eighty-five percent of the 'probably' voters in Massachusetts said that the senator did not have to be selective, according to a study of the Political Research Center of the Suffolk University and Boston Globe.
Twenty-two percent of them would have made it possible for them to be selective.
The study showed that there was more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 per cent before a possible candidate and 48 per cent against.
Other names of prominent Democrats involved in the possible participation of Presidential Elections in 2020 are former Vice-Presidents Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
He said he would officially make a decision in January, according to a report by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's PTSS during a selection meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, has spent a year in Iraq after serving in September.
He was arrested and charged with a report of domestic violence on Monday night.
"With what my own son needs to remember, what he now brings him back, I understand for other families who experience the consequences of PTSS and the surprises that some of our soldiers return with," she told the audience that she was present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they come back a little different, they come back and become stronger, they come back and ask themselves if there is any respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other soldiers have given to the country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, including a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 states support protests against a new asylum policy
Eighty states and the District of Colombia support a legal protest against a new policy in the U.S. which prevents victims from fleeing from gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. have made a statement on Friday as a 'friend-van-het-hof' to the Washington Court in support of an asylum seeker who is involved in this policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace vs. Sessions of the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy is not known.
She says that her partner "and her violent sons who are members of a gang" have abused her but that American officials have rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
The lawyers of the States that support Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people are asylum seekers in the U.S., as countries that are aware of major problems in the field of money and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has returned a decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeals from 2014, in which it was possible for immigrants without documents running for domestic violence to ask for asylum.
Karl Racine, Attorney General of Washington D.C., said on Friday in a statement that the new policy "has been rejecting state, federal and international legislation for decades".
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such a restriction is contrary to that principle" is set out in the statement of the 'friend-of-the- Court'.
Lawyers further argue that the policy whereby immigrants are denied access to the U.S., damages the US economy, as these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country 'preventing the necessary labour force'.
Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, in June, did not recommend any asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
"Asiel is available for those who have fled their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion" so Sessions in their announcement on 11 June of the policy.
Asiel was never meant to solve all the problems, even if these are serious, with which people get to the world every day.
Vulnerable rescue efforts in Palu while the number of deaths doubled in race to find survivors
The situation continued to worsen for the survivors.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while trying to trust her short baby in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"Every minute new arrivals appear in ambulances.
And clean water is dry."
Residents came back to their destroyed houses and sought in their overnight possessions valuables that they could still use.
Hundreds of people have been injured and the hospitals are overcrowded, so that they are not damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
Several wounded, including Dwi Haris, who has had a broken back and shoulders, rest outside the hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of the possibility of severe nausea.
His eyes filled with tears as he told of his feelings when the devastating earthquake hit the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed against the rest of a wall," Haris told a representative of the Associated Press and added this when he and his family were in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, and later I heard nothing.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accused China of "intimidation" with "proaganda-advertenties"
A week after an official Chinese news paper published an announcement of four pages in an American newspaper, where the opposite benefits of trade between the US and China were presented, the US ambassador in China Beijing accused the use of American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last to China Daily's paid-up annex in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after he accused China of joining the American Congress elections of 6 November, a charge that China rejects.
Tromps accused Beijing of trying to compete with the U.S. elections, marked, according to American officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in a scaling campaign by Washington to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign authorities to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a scalaring trade war, in which they have raised import prices.
China's compensation agencies were specifically directed to meet exporters in countries such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, as said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had met American workers, farmers and companies.
"China", as Branstad wrote in an opinion in Des Moines Register of Sunday, "has now doubled the intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press".
"By spreading this propaganda, the government of China uses freedom of opinion and free press, a long-paid tradition in America by placing a paid advertising in Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, you will find strange voices at a church in the centre of Beijing, and you will not see any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people have about the difficult economic path, because the media is firmly below the shadow of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "the scene of China has refused to publish its article" if he did not say what paper it was.
According to the Kavanaugh debacle, the Republican women's voters were disappointed by the fact that they did not vote for the interim elections, warning analysts
Now many important republics around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defend him against various allegations of sexual violence, warn analysts that this will bring them back, in particular among women, during the upcoming inter-time elections.
The emotions about this issue have been very intense and most Republics have already let them know that they want to vote.
"These things can't be traced back," said Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article that appeared today.
Reeher said he wondered whether the attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (Republic, Arizona) to pursue a FBI investigation would be sufficient to satisfy the wrong voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow, and they will not forget it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, an senior consultant and spokesman for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, delegates called "November" during their demonstration in half of the Senate, while the Republics that the Justice Commission has taken control of chose to choose Kavanaugh's candidates well, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who reported that.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will achieve a high record," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the news site.
"People say it's high, and that's true.
However, it can continue to run, especially among pregnant female voters in the outlying areas and among young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who often do not vote even though they do not agree with the president."
Even for Ford's public testimony, in which she further explained her accusation of sexual harassment against the High Court's candidate, analysts suggested that there would be a return if the Republics were to press the nomination.
"This has become a confusing hope for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican Party, last week according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote in the committee, or whether the final vote or that Kavanaugh takes place in the court, but also about the way the Republicans have dealt with this and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats to be elected, clearly on the news channel.
The Americans, however, appear to be divided on the question of who they believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, where a small majority stands on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents are sure or likely to believe the testimony of Ford and 35 percent are sure or likely to believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh had probably lied during his testimony while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the submission of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges of Ford and at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate's Justice Commission last week that Kavanaugh had taken her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez argues that the candidate for the Supreme Court has shown her to her during a party that they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The discoverer of the World Wide Web plants a new internet to catch Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the discoverer of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest technological project, is a company based on the open source platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid offers users the opportunity to choose where their data is stored and which persons have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee recorded that 'world control' is the leading thought behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said about the start.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to make their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
Lists of contacts, activities lists, an agenda, a music library and other personal and professional tools can be stored here.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together through one browser and all at the same time.
What POD makes unique is the fact that it completely depends on the user who has access to the information.
The company calls this 'personal power through data'.
The idea behind Inrupt is according to CEO John Bruce that the company provides the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers engaged in working on the project, and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not going to have any discussions with "Facebook and Google on whether or not to introduce a complete transformation which puts all their business models in their head at once".
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Media published today, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission (from Inrupt) is to provide the commercial energy and an ecosystem that protects the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Also after the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new time for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: spiritual and wearer of Victoria Cross from WO I
The only spiritual of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during World War I was killed as a soldier 100 years later in his birth place.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann received the distinction following the attack at Bellenglish and Lehacourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a shooter and thus never knew that he had been part of the highest British military honour.
A memorial stone was uncovered by its two small zones during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the small zones, Michael Vann, said that the 'brilliant symbolisch' was that the stone was suddenly discovered 100 years after the fact that his father was separated.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battle on September 29, 1918 over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very thick mess and under heavy fire of forest and machinery".
He later broke through to the fireline and led the line forward before he alone ran to a field shelter and turned out three members of the deck.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann died on 4 October 1918, more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never touch, but also something that makes me feel humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, have also laid another crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "was very upset to have a role in the parade" and added that "the severity of a real hero is evident from the support he receives from a large number of people."
Fans of MMA got up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine, you've been awake all night to see a stalked Bellator 206 and you won't see the most important moment.
On the application note from San Jose, 13 battles were mentioned, including six in the main section, and this was sent all night to the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., right at the moment that Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared themselves for their fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were surprised to see the sender turned over to Peppa Pig.
Some were alarmed because they had been awake all night especially for this fight.
One of them described the transition to the child program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"According to the government's rules, after 6:00 a.m., no content may be shown which is not suitable for children, and therefore we had to switch to the children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president for marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was asked to be sent.
"Peppa's pig," yesss.
Scott Cooker, president of Bellator's company, said they are going to adjust their programming to ensure that the observers in the United Kingdom also have a chance in the future.
"I think, with a view to the fight back, we can solve this problem," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday, and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the overcrowding, many text messages went back and again and believed me, they were not all just friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I can promise this will never happen again.
We limited the shipments to five nights instead of six, as we usually did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferieur' because of his sexual attraction
The Olympic Cleaner Tom Daley says that he felt during his youth inferior because of his sexual inclination, but this gave him the motivation to be successful.
The 14-year-old said that he did not realize that 'not everyone is like me' until he went to further education.
In a conversation with Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about the right to give 'hope' to others.
He also said that age had contributed to his less worth of winning during the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular representative of the long-term show, has been free of disease for a few months.
Apparently as a shift on Laverne's first program, Daley told himself that he felt 'lower' than others because 'socially not accepted to find both girls and boys'.
He said: "To this day those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, are real facts that have given me the strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was an 'imman' so that he would not disappoint people if they finally came after him.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a prominent campaign leader for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Community Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to criminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke out because he was happy behind that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others a 'hope'.
The three-year-old World Championships said that the fact that he was loved to a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, "has completely surprised me".
Daley was married last year to the Oscarwinnaar, who is 20 years older than he, but said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When you have to endure so young," he participated in his first Olympic Games at a four-year-old age and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone in your own age group who has contributed to the same high and low points.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "very perspective" was changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it all worked for the win of a gold medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at a 40-year-old age after receiving the diagnosis of cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked if they had already received the cards for London 2012, because he wanted to be on the first row.
"I couldn't get it over my heart to say, you won't be there to sit on the first row," he said.
"I held his hand firmly when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stopped and he died, finally I could admit that he wasn't infinity," he said.
The following year, Daley joined the 2012 Olympic Games and won a source.
"I knew I had been dreaming about this all my life. To thank a local audience during the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first musician, Proud by Heather Small, who had taken him strongly on the way to the games and where he still got kippel from.
Desert Island Discs is to be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on bank during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to find his way back to make no sad smiles.
Mickelson, who participates for the 12th time in the two-year event, was placed on the bank by the captain Jim Furyk team for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the centre of action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors shares the day between the support of his teammates and the training of the driving range in an effort to delay it.
Since he was not even known on the tip of his career for his right drive, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the nearby Le Golf National railways, where the long grass of the roughs disappears routinely.
And if the job itself is not cut-off enough, Mickelson will come to the ninth match on Sunday at the exact Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, against which it is linked to newling Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who are behind four points at the beginning of the 12 single matches, well start well, the match of Mickelson can be absolutely crucial.
Fraud has made it seem to have confidence in this man, even though he could honestly say otherwise.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a kick on the back, beat his arm around me and said he was ready for tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has much confidence in himself.
He was enrolled in the Hall of Fame and has contributed so much to this team, in the past but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two matches.
I had more to expect, but it's like it is, and it's the way we had to deal with it.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson can improve Nick Faldo's record on Sunday for the highest number of games played Ryder Cup matches.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never completely missed the heights of his personal career.
Mickelson has won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 games on his name, but Furyk said his presence had a certain devastating influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's tired, he likes to take out jokes with people, and he's a great guy to have in the team," he said.
"I think the young players found it fun to take him off and then for the rest of the week, that was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than his game alone."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that great progress can soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable front at the single matches on the last day of Ryder Cup can easily be converted into a less comfortable situation.
The Deen made their debut in the battle in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with Captain Seven Ballesteros had a five-point lead on the Americans, but finally the final line passed with the smallest possible margin: 1411⁄2-131/2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just," said Bjorn, quoted here, after he had seen the 2018 win with 5-3 on Friday and tomorrow, well for a prize of 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and all the others in the team that this is not yet a game.
Everyone's gonna have to sit in full tomorrow.
Go to the battle and implement the plan.
It's not over to the points on the table.
We have a goal, and that's how these trophies win, and that's where we need to keep focusing.
I keep saying, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Happy about the performances of his players on a heavy golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go ahead in this area.
Tomorrow's waiting for a new challenge.
Tomorrow the individual performances come to order, and that is again a very different discipline.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it's okay, but when you're alone, your abilities as a golfer are really tested.
That's the message you have to tell the players, trying to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he needs to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to do better individually than partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who won three of the four points.
Fury himself experienced both sides of this kind around the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brooklyn and as a survivor when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word of that talk," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had appointed his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games for the wedding tomorrow, but let's try to start well, like in Brooklyn, or like in Medinah.
When we have the moment, there's a lot of pressure on the games in the middle.
We agreed on our lineup and sent the men on the way to the order that we think is the best and, you know, we're going to try something out of the high hat tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the opposite and placing Rory McIlroy in front of the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the shot.
"I have chosen this group in this order, because I think we have been so constantly covered," Bjorn said of his selection of single players.
The New Warship of Germany Again
The latest fleet of the German Navy would have to come into service in 2014, replacing the old warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will last at least one year before it is ready, due to defective systems and current costs, reported local media.
The establishment of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the new Baden-Wertemberg class, has now been launched until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Time, which mentions a military dictionary.
The vessel should have been part of the sea in 2014 but the disturbing problems after delivery have created the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wertemberg class that the sea has ordered in 2007 are used to replace the old frigates of the Bremen-class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a number of aircraft and anti-ship rockets and a form of steelth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and coastal features.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to insert the latest frigates up to two years after each other, away from homesteads.
However, the continued delays mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to give Germany the opportunity to project their powers over, have grown older by the time they are taken into business, notes the Time.
The emergency frigate F125 brought all the news headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship in business and sent it back to the shipyard Bloom & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the marine had sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There is little known about the reasons behind this return, but German media cited a number of crucial 'software and hardware deficits' that would make the warship useless if it were to be placed in a fight mission.
Software deficits were particularly important because the Baden-Wertemberg class ships are operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers, half the manpower on the frigates of the old Bremen class.
It was also clear that the ship was heavily overweighted, which would reduce its performance and limit the ability of the sea to carry out further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, twice as much as a ship of a comparable class that was invested by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price card for the complete project, including the training of the crew, is already a problem.
It is said that this has reached a thousands of €3.1 billion, compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems that the newest frigates have in their grip are particularly important because of recent warnings that the German Navy will withdraw.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Parliamentary Defence Commission in Germany, recognized that the sea actually has "a shortage of ships".
The officer said that the problem of time as a snowball had been raised because old ships had been brought out of business but no replacement ships had been provided.
He claimed that none of the requests from the Baden-Wertemberg class were available to be included in the sea.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Leather Mouses
A new survey carried out on a farm in the Scottish Highlands tries to discover how to use livestock mice from the countryside in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will give new light to the behaviour of these unique flying animals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland follows the usual and small milling mill, the brown large-scale mill and the water mill at Inverwe Gardens in West Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed on key locations around the landscape to monitor the activities of the pools by the season.
NTS staff and volunteers are also conducting mobile research using manual detectors.
An expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the crests of the velvet and what kind of action it does.
Then a map of the habitat is produced and a report is produced to make a detailed picture on the landscape of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural protection consultant of the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are the most important for molluscs and how they are used by the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the making of habitats and how we can maintain the forests best for molluscs and similar species.
The majority of the population in Scotland and the rest of the UK have been taken down significantly in the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that have an impact on shelters and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightnings can also pose a risk, just as pilots and certain chemical treatments of construction materials and attacks by households.
Fleer mice are not really blind.
By their nightly hunting habits, however, their ears are more useful than their eyes than it is to catch a proo.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight size.
The NTS, responsible for providing more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares to land in the country, is taking very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts who regularly investigate, inspect shelters and sometimes carry out rescue operations.
The organisation has even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the village of Thrive in Dumfries and Galloway, where the ten species of bats live in Scotland.
Landing Manager David Thompson says the landscape is the ideal territory for the mosses.
"Here in Thrive we have a great environment for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, very very old trees and the right habitat.
But there is still so much about bats that the work we do here and in other locations will help us better understand what they need to do."
He stresses the importance of control of poultry mice before maintenance operations are carried out, as the possible unconscious destruction of a place of sleep can result in the death of 400 female pigs and their young boys, which may require a complete local population.
Vleermuses are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, to fall, to rot, or to destroy their sleeping places.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Schots branched for the Bat Conservation Trust, asked the public to provide a contribution to help.
She said, "We still have to learn a lot about our fly mice and many of our species we just don't know how it goes with their populations."
Ronaldo rejects charges of assault while his lawyers are preparing to follow a German magazine
Cristian Ronaldo qualified for charges of assault as 'fake news' and said that people 'want to promote themselves' by using his name.
His lawyers are at the point of complaining about the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the charges have been published.
The visit of Portugal and Juventus is charged with the arrest of an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
In addition, he is charged with paying her $375.000 to cheat on the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
With a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33 hours after the charges were reported, reported 'fake news'.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, often news," says the winner of five Golden Ballen on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and through and through well," the footballer added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a case for which they want to follow Der Spiegel for the charges they called 'an unacceptable report of memories in the area of privacy', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said that the footballer wants compensation for the 'moral damage to a sum corresponding to the serious crime, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The related incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting each other in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the football room, where he encouraged her, according to the charge, as to read in the complaint filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo was killed after the related incident on his kidneys and that he told her that for '99 percent' he was a 'good fan', but that he was sometimes left in the cage that 'one percent'.
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that he had a couple of sex, but that this was good with each other.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that there are photos of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed with an extrajudicial arrangement because she was 'treprehensible for the consequences' and because she was concerned about 'public degradation'.
The 34-year-old now says that she wants to explain the regime invalidate because she is constantly traumatized by the related incident.
Ronaldo stood at the point of Manchester United to go to Real Madrid during the relative round and this summer to the Italian giant Juventus was left in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: the United Kingdom 'will have no forgiveness for ever' as auto producers
The United Kingdom 'will never regret it' when it loses its status as world leader in the field of self-production after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that when Toyota UK had said against the BBC that if Britain had left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily stop production in the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese autoproducer said that the impact of delays at the border in the case of 'no-deal Brexit' jobs would be costly.
The factory in Burnaston, where the Auris and Avenue of Toyota is made, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My vision is that when Britain falls out of the EU by the end of March, we will see the production in our factory" said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also voiced their concerns about the consequences of an EU departure without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already announced that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most of the concerns concern the auto producers are about the risks in delivery chains in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
Toyota’s production line is based on the ‘just-in-time’ principle, where every 37 minutes of supplies are obtained from suppliers in the UK and in the EU for cars which are ordered.
If the EU leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there can be a disappointment at the boundaries which the industry considers could lead to delays and cuts in shares.
Toyota cannot store supplies for more than one day in the Derbyshire factory, so the company knows, and would therefore stop production.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU was 'exactly agreed to avoid those controls at the border'.
"We need a deal. We want the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success, but also take this opportunity," he told the listeners of the BBC Radio 4's Today Programme.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, is that we can definitely go with this very successful set of delivery chains."
Toyota was unable to tell how long the production would be stopped, but it was further advised that the additional costs would affect the company's competitive position and that this would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, and who is a representative of the Union trade union at the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs have been lost, they will never come back again.
A spokesman from the government said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The conference of Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed once more, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and the deputy prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein can't be held for a week, while the dispute over the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, went on, said White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the activities of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the influence of the Russian elections, links between Trump and Russia's assistants and possible impediments to the rule of law by the President.
The question of Trup will be resolved by the deputy prosecutor-general and thereby endanger Mueller's independence, the Washington machine has been running for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to establish talks with Trump and to withdraw the President through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected this report.
But when he left last Monday to the White House, the round he was about to take his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he did not want to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing of the Senate's Justice Commission, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week's investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which delayed the vote in the full Senate.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, chief of Trump, appeared on Fox News.
Asked to meet with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date set for this week, but it could also be postponed for a week, given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always want to keep the press high."
Some rapporteurs had difficulty with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The guest Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the most expensive press conferences were not caused by a rejection of the 'paying attention' TV journalists, however, they added: "I will not deny that they are trying to draw attention."
Then they suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President shall make more questions and replies than any president before him," she said, without giving proof: "We have looked at the figures."
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, that is much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it a lot and you've often seen it last week and that will take place at a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trip regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or when attending public sessions or during press conferences with visitors.
Conferences with the President alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president demonstrated why he may have made an open and strange appearance to the rapporteurs gathered.
Minister for Health writes a letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland employees from other EU countries
The Minister for Health has written a letter to EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and the wish that they continue to work with the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter of less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has absolutely agreed to bear the costs of applying for a stable status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UN and the EU are continuing, and this autumn will be the expected decisions.
At the same time, however, the UK government has also signed the preparations for a possible scenario in which no discussion is reached.
I know this must be some time for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how I appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from all over the EU and outside, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the activities of the NHS and provide benefits for the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland's fixed and sure you're home, and we'd like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undertakes a rapid operation after head injury
The online banker of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was under a rapid operation yesterday after he was in the 31-27 lost battle against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennesean.
Rod Reed, chief coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident was short for rest.
"He came to the line and hung there a little or more," said Reed.
The coaches and the medical staff gave Abercrombie straight oxygen on the line before they placed it on a stretcher and took him for further research.
A member of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come from the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that 'there are no details yet known about the type/size of the lens' and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the needle is located.
Abercrombie, a 'redshirt sophomore', is in its first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was arrested on Saturday in total five times before leaving the field, which made him arrested 18 times in total.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher bills when they buy a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher bills when they buy a house in the UK and the proceeds are used to help rooflocks in accordance with new conservation plans
This action will have to neutralize Corbyn's success to attract young voters
The increase in the law is imposed on persons who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this to cost £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher bills when they buy a house in the UK and the extra income are used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success, which attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable houses and to tell it to many servers.
The increase in the law is imposed on persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, where extra income is withheld in an effort by the government to combat unemployment.
The aid, which comes above the current law, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and houses purchased for rent, may amount to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to collect up to £120 million per year in this way.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the new building in London is purchased by people who do not live in the UK. This will boost prices and it is difficult for starters to get a foot on the tenant.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically 'spooch cities' due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson had ordered a reduction in the law to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping prices high by buying and not using the land and called on May to set up quotas in affordable houses to restore the 'home damage' in Great Britain.
Corbyn has announced a series of housing reforms, including housing funds and an end to the outbreak of 'without disability'.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new houses.
May said: "A year ago I said that I wanted to spend my time as the first minister to restore the 'British Dream', making life better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be as simple as it is for people who do not live in the UK, and for foreign companies, to buy houses here if it is for hard-working British citizens.
For so many people, the dream is never to have a house that has become a very empty dream and the degradation of life without a roof over the head is too real."
Jack Ross: 'My last ambition is the management of Scotland'
Jack Ross, the boss of Sunderland, says it's his 'ultimate ambition' to be ever managed by Scotland.
The Schot, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from the northeastern part of England, currently located in the third place in League One, on three points from the first place.
He left early this summer to the Stadium or Light after he had returned to the Scottish Premiership in St. Mirren's last season.
"As a football player, I wanted to play for my father's country.
But I was selected for the B team and with that was the choice," Ross told Sports Sound at BBC Scotland.
"When I was a child, I saw my father Scotland play often in Hampden Park and it's something that keeps drawing me.
However, that option would only come if I were successful in managing a club."
The presidents of Ross as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says that he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names at a large club, before he had refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Succes is now measured for me by 'can I let this club go back to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it must be in the Premier League," he says.
"It's not a simple task to achieve this, but I can just see myself as successful as I bring the club back there."
Ross is only three years in charge of his career as manager, after a period of time as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the training group of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St. Mirren from the edge of degradation to winning the Championship in the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a football player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably a cross point" he reminded himself of the moment he took the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds weird, because I'm doing the best I can, I'm reasonably well worth it, and I know a few reasonable points.
But football can be heavy.
There's a lot of things you're dealing with every week.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the factory, but management just feels good.
I always want to be a manager, and now I'm real, I'm as good in my skin as I've never felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, unexpected investigation
The summer heat golf has increased incomes from British pubs who are struggling to survive, but has also put more pressure on restaurants.
Groups with pubs and bars saw the turnover rise by 2.7% in July, but the income in restaurants was 4.8% lower, show the figures.
Peter Martin, of the business advice agency CGA, who collected the figures, said: "For the last few days, and the fact that England is longer than expected to participate in the World Championships, means that July looks like a similar pattern as June, when the pubs had 2.8% more traffic, with the fact that the restaurants were now being hit.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in the distribution of restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars that are focused on the sale of alcohol served from the best, with a better LFL growth (like-for-like) than those restaurants went down.
Pubs who are also focused on the sale of food are also members of the sun, but not as dramatic as restaurants.
It seems that people are just on the menu to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, the drinking rate was 6.6 percent higher for the month, while the food supply was 3 percent lower."
Paul Newman of RSM, analysts for the free-time and hospitality sector, said: "These results will continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sports events remain the biggest factors for the market in spending.
It is not surprising, then, that restaurant groups continue to complain, although a change of 4.8 per cent per year is particularly painful in view of the continuing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer was possible for operators who did not come at a bad time and will only be able to learn if the more moderate temperatures of August can provide the necessary recovery."
The total turnover in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the decline from the introduction of new brands.
In the Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, the performance data is collected and analysed by 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of £9 billion. This is the established benchmark of the industry.
One of the five children has a secret account for social media, which they keep hidden for their parents.
One of the five children, only not older than 11 years old, has a secret account for social media that they hide for parents and teachers, discovers an investigation.
Surveys of 20,000 students from secondary schools revealed growth in 'false Insta pages'
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be placed
Twenty percent of the students say they have a main account that they also show their parents.
One of the five children, only not older than 11 years old, makes social media accounts that they keep hidden for adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in the 'false Instagram accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be placed.
Twenty percent of the students say they use a clean 'mainda account' to show their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who came to her 13-year-old daughter in case of a secret site discovered a teenager who asked her to 'strengthen' to others.
The study conducted by Digital Avaress UK and HMC (Headmasters" and Head Mistresses" Conference) of independent schools found that 40 percent of the 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half of them were allowed to monitor personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: "It is surprising that so many teenagers are being abandoned to create online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Elidh Doyle is the voice of the athletes in the Scottish Council
Elidh Doyle was elected to the Council of the Scottish athletic world, as the non-executive director at the general annual meeting of the Management Board.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland at the stage and in the field and president Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for sports managers to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilih has a lot of respect in Scotland's athletic community, the UK and the world, and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from her choice in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am happy to be able to serve as a vote for the athletes, and I hope that I can contribute and help to manage sports in Scotland."
The American who lived 200 meters and 400 meters during the 1996 Games in Atlanta, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now regularly comment on the BBC, could no longer run after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "One month ago, I had a CIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will teach me whether I will recover and how much.
It's been really hard work, but I've been completely restored, I've been learning again and doing my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all the supporting evidence!"
Warning for breast pumps in which mothers are compared with dogs, distributed online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has shared the online opinion with an announcement in which such mothers are compared to dogs that are breast-feeding.
In order to mark the introduction of what is called 'the most quiet portable breast pump in the world', Elvie, producer of consumer technology, issued an ironic, inspired announcement on music videos to illustrate the freedom that this new pump has to offer to cool mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a loud-filled squeal on a song that contains texts like, 'Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see anything' and 'In case you didn't have it in the streets, these are no eggs, these are my breasts'.
The refresher then goes on: 'Bump, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the lady's.'
However, the advertising, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has directly provided for an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has released hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say that the 'horror' of the sugar industry is being rewarded here.
"A bad choice to use dogs to warn this product.
Like us, they must be expected and ordered to produce milk, but in their case the babies will be taken away within a few days after the vaccination" is written in a response.
Elvie's breast pump fits discrete in a food bag (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else noted: "It's, of course, traumatic for mother and baby.
But, yes, why don't we use them to warn mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added: "This announcement is so far away from reality."
Others defended the announcement, and a woman let her find the song 'halarish'.
"I find this a great idea.
I'd be able to create one if I still had breast feeding.
That pumps made me feel like a cow.
The announcement is a little weird, but I haven't been looking too much.
This is a great product" someone wrote.
Someone else had the following comment: "It's a funny announcement, focusing on moms who's cold (often at work or in a toilet) and then it's just feeling like 'choking'.
This announcement is not entirely positive or negative over the coal industry."
At the end of the video you see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discrete hidden in their beha's.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women do not sometimes feel bad.
The Elvie Pump, however, is completely quiet, has no wires or snakes and fits discrete in a food bag, so that women have the freedom to move, to keep their babies fixed and even to go out while they're on ice.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says this: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a stout and provocative introduction.
By making a comparison between cool mothers and milk cows, we wanted to place the coal and the associated challenges in the mirror and to show in a consistent and understandable way how the new pump will provide for an incredible feeling of freedom.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump gets the front page.
During the London Fashion Week a mother of two appeared on Martha Jakubowski's catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children slowly move to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of targeted migrant children has reached a peak, although the number of monthly crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the strong rhetoric and strong policy introduced by the Trup government, making it more difficult to involve children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are undocumented immigrants themselves and they are afraid of their own chance to remain in the country by reporting for a child.
This risk was increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households must print their fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, an senior immigration officer and Customs Enforcement, testified to the convention that his organization had arrested dozens of people who had become sponsors for unaccompanied minors.
The organisation later confirmed that 70 percent of the prisoners had no previous criminal record.
"By 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in this country, and most of them are criminal foreigners.
We are about to follow these people," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to speed up the processing of children, officials have introduced new rules, so that a few of them are obliged within one month of the start of the detention, to appear before the court, instead of within 60 days, which were previously the standard, according to the employees at the Shelter.
Many of them will be through a video conference for the court, instead of in person, to order their application for a legal status for an immigration lawyer.
Those who are not considered to be eligible for aid will be deported soon.
The longer children remain pregnant, the greater the chance that they will become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent abortions or refugee efforts, according to employees at the Shelter and reports from the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that these concerns are stronger at a greater ease, such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is being abused more often, due to the extent of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say anything to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them have already experienced.
Syria commands the US's 'receiving power', France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem also called back the Syrian refugees, even now in the eighth year of war in the country.
Moualem, also vice-president, said that foreign troops were illegally on the Syrian border, under the pretext of combating terrorism and that 'this will be dealt with accordingly'.
"They must leave immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced and displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue with "this holy war until we have freed all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from a "probably illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, particularly with regard to the training and advice of the Kurdish troops and the Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-distorted country.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are favourable for their return and he intends to 'several Western countries spread ironic fears', which is why most refugees remain away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They're policy-makers who should be just a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid is available for Syria until a political agreement is concluded between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the most important bulge of the rebellion, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The division between Russia and Turkey has resulted in a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian troops in the province, where three million people live.
Moulalem, however, stressed that this agreement was known as 'explain deadlines' and said he hoped that the military action would be directed against the Jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda.
Staffan the Mistura, the UN official, hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to design a framework law for the post-war war for Syria and to open the way for elections.
Moualem made it clear what the conditions of the Syrian Government were to take part in the Commission and said that the work of the panel should be limited 'to the revision of the articles of the current Constitution' and warned against interference from outside.
Why Trump won a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would win the elections in 2020 unless, as many 'liberal' viewers are likely to hope, his presidency will continue to be terminated by a replacement procedure and scandals.
There is no doubt that 'the most dramatic final of a presidency' would ever be.
At this point, however, there are no signs of visibility.
Since 2014, the ‘primary-time’ survey figures at CNN have doubled to 1.05 million and almost doubled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during 'primary-time', compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and 'The Rachel Maddow Show' from MSNBC is at the top of the evaluations for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers at night with important news.
"This is a fire that draws people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the responsible behind the ABC drama 'Designed Survivor' a series of ministers who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scowell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has another theory.
It recalls a taxi in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd vote on Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said 'Because he made me laugh'," Savoll told me.
There's a value of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, contrary to everything else on TV, the stories coming from Washington can affect the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrant families can renegotiate or influence the status of the world economy.
Turn off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it will be more than a well-informed citizen when you get in the streets that you are already sitting on a panel of experts discussing the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', which has about the jack of Paul Manafort's paawn teacher who has cost $15,000 (a garment full of overmound' according to The Washington Post) and who discuss the implications of the color description by Stormy Daniels of the, uh, Anatomy of Trump.
In any case, I will never be able to look at Super Mario in the same way.
"What he does to give you the idea that it's going to be a reality show is part of letting you get something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the manufacturer of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating role distribution of the Trump show and the daily shifts (a fight with the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't afford to miss a delivery or you have the idea that you're running behind.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kaai, but he was inside to look at MSNBC while he was at CNN.
He could not get rid of the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh, who had to appear before the Senate Justice Commission and the future of the High Court that was at stake.
"I remember that we did all these rare shows, not so long ago, and that people said 'it's the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it seems they were right."

External cash flows in the most exciting interim elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees an abundance of money, thanks to a re-allocation of a electoral district, which requires two people sitting there to fight against the same seat.
The newly relocated district of Pittsburg meets the Democratic People's Representative Conor Lamb, who has acquired his seat in another district in a special election lens.
Lamb must take action against another representative of the People's Republic, Keith Rothfus, who is currently represented by the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is well-known to the new 17th district.
The cards were re-divided after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were illegally distributed ('remination') for the benefit of the Republics.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a cut-off in the field of campaign funding between the financial poor of the two large parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a nice victory in a well-known special election for the 18th election district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been owned by a Republican and President Donald Trump for more than ten years, which has been divided by 20 percentage points.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The U.S. considered El Salvador to be punished for aid to China and rejected it
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a hearty meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners left the Trump Organization management team.
Officials of the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to call back the US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the 'Recent Decision not to recognise Taiwan anymore' said Heather Nauert, Prime Minister, in a statement earlier this month.
However, punishments were considered only in the case of El Salvador, as the country received $140 million from US aid in 2017 for drug control, development and economic support.
The penalties proposed, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high homicide rates.
As the internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference, which would focus on security and economic well-being as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from leaving the United States.
However, in September, some of the officials from the government knew that they wanted the conference to take place, thereby making all possible criminal measures against El Salvador impossible.
The plan is now that Vice-President Mike Pence holds a speech at the conference, which is now planned for half of October, as a sign of the importance of the government's intention to attend the meeting, the diplomats say.
And the three U.S. agents have been returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without strong messages of criminal measures in Washington.
A speaker from the White House, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal debate under the terms of anonymousity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and who also speaks on the condition of anonymity.
Learn History
The next step may be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible interference of justice by Trump, for which serious evidence has now been made public.
Mueller's research is probably also aimed at constituencies between the Tromp campaign and Russia in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If the Congress changes color, Trump must take responsibility for that institution, just as he prepares himself to go back to the voters, and perhaps he must be responsible for a jury in a court.
That is a hope, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, or those of its equivalents in Europe.
There will be choices to be made by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, which will determine how long the war will last.
In 1938 the German officers were ready to execute a 'cop d'estat' against Hitler, but only if the West had rebelled and Czech-Slovakia had supported them in Munich.
We lost and lost an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points and the inevitable rise in democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently confronted with different types of mountain ranges.
What will we do if Trump's deputy prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein leaves, the man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the time this page reported that he had suggested, last year, to hold conversations with the President in secret and that he had specified the appropriateness of the President for his office.
Rosenstein says The Times report doesn't work.
"How will we react if the new FBI investigation to Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or not fair, or if he is appointed in the Supreme Court despite credible charges of arrest and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that Trump will be responsible for?
If we fall into these tests, democracy waits for a very long winter.
But I believe we're not going to fall through the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had ever owned my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me, 60 years later, away to pick up candles before the Sabbath on the table on which a swastika was depicted.
With that as my heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Glasgov Rangers is optimistic about the fight against Rapid Wien
Rangers are given Rapid Wien on Thursday and know that after the impressive match in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, they are placed in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the European League.
The middle-fielder Graham Dorrans was not able to play his first game of the season until the 2-2 matches at Villarreal, but he believed that the Rangers could use the results as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good eleven," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the fight with the idea that there was a lot to win and the fight came out with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end, but it's probably a fair outcome of the whole fight.
They were probably better in the first half, but when we came out in the second half, we were the best.
The next Thursday is a new big European evening.
Hopefully we can hold three points, but it is going to be a tough fight because they have also had a good outcome in their final fight. But if the public is behind us, I am sure that we can press through and that we can have a positive outcome.
The past year has certainly been hard, of all that happened with my blessings and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a problem factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it. The training is good.
Hopefully we can print now, leave the last season behind us and be successful again."
Women can't sleep due to fear of their pensions
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they would like to receive care, few people discuss this with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationalwide survey said they were talking to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to care for them, but they don't take the steps they need to take to make this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice-president for life insurance at the Nationalwide.
Here we go.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family there to take care of if you don't make your wishes known in time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to get care, because these options can be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Take a financial adviser in the arms: Your advisor can also give you advice on how to pay these expenses.
Your long-term financing options may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash to help cover these expenses, or establish its own capacity as insurance, as long as you have money.
Set up legal documents: Avoid legal conflict when the insurance is to be entered.
Take full care of health care, so that you can show a trusted person who can look after your medical care and make sure that the professionals stick to your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Consider also the full power for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and to ensure that the invoices are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is facing a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergy in that case?
Put these details in a written plan so that you have the information in your hand.
"It's not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are used?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure the plan comes."
Several times you were arrested with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was attacked several times by an air pressure attack when he walked home after an accident.
The victim, forty plus, was found in the Oxford Grove near Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, neck and hand.
Agents describe the decision, which last night about 02:30 BST, as a 'optional'.
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have called on witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and it is expected that the death rate will continue to rise.
Since the communication equipment has been disabled, the official authorities have not yet received information from the Dondhia Regency, a region north of Palu which is closer to the epicenter of the fortress with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Dodhra, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the Province of Midden-Celebes and is located at the end of a small bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with a estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city fourth is the 40th anniversary of the tsunami.
Dodhea is a rain forest that extends over more than 300 km along the coast of northwestern Celebes.
The government, an administrative region under a province, had a estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the Province of Midden-Celebes, particularly in the coastal area of Dodrea.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are for most of Morozilia, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Dodhra have been regularly hit by tsunamis over the past hundred years, according to the Indonesian Disasters Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and hundreds of destroyed houses in Dodrya.
A tsunami struck in the west of Dodraa in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the worst earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh in northern Sumatra on 26 December provided for a tsunami that struck 14 countries and claimed total 226.000 lives along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Atjeh.
2005: A number of heavy earthquakes took place in the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, for the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a force of 6.8 on the Richter scale took place in southern Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, and caused tsunamis that claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people found death.
2010: An earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale struck one of the Mentawai islands, at the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of more than 10 metres that destroyed tens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: An unprecedented earthquake struck the Pidie River in Atjeh and caused destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the destructions of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
There were no tsunamis following this time, but more than 100 people found death by devastating buildings.
2018: More earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist country Lombok, where more than 500 people were killed, for most of the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and made it possible for thousands of tourists to travel temporarily.
Oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and candidate for the vice-presidentship, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested for thinking of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and offering resistance during the trial, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a woman known as a police officer tried to call the police to report the alleged seizures, she took off her phone.
Palin is kept in custody in the house of storage Mat-Su with a fee of $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared before the judge on Saturday and declared himself 'unjust, certainly know' when he was asked, reported the network.
Palin is charged with three offences of Class A, which means he can be sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also accused of a breach of Class B, which is punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not for the first time that Palin is accused of criminal facts.
In December 2017 he was charged with the abuse of his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case now serves for Alaska's Veterinary Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic abuse, including a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence in connection with the incident.
His friend claimed he had shot her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by a group of veterans after she had linked her son's violent behavior to PTSS, which he would have continued to serve in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 died after a earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale has led to a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been disabled while the expected death rate will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place near the center of Celebes, located in the northeastern part of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are circular videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors require a rare death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York require the death penalty for Sajfoello Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, where eight people have been killed, a rare punishment that has not been executed in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, used a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a train path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he was on foot and on his way around October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the complainants will have to prove that Saipov 'opportunity' has killed the eight victims and 'opportunity' has brought serious physical injuries, according to the intentional declaration in which the death penalty is required, submitted in the Southern District of New York.
For both complaints, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted by the Court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal large jury approved the recharge of 22 complaints, including eight charges of murder for a rocket, typically a complaint used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and a complaint of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack requires 'substantial planning and preparation', according to the complainants, and they describe the way Saipov carried out the attack as 'fragious, cruel and lost'.
"Sajfoello Habiboellajevisj Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco" is in the intentional statement.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
More than ten years ago, in the Southern District of New York, a case in which the death penalty was imposed.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after two years of being sentenced for spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both set up by the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, did not provide any evidence of complaint in the days and months following the attack, according to the legal documents.
He let the investigator know that he felt good about what he did, she was the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the complaint.
He also asked for ISIS's flag to be hung in his room in the hospital, told the police.
He was not charged with the recharge of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was 'naturally disappointed' with the decision of the prosecutors.
"We believe that the decision to accept the death penalty instead of a confession of guilt in a roll for a life sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned," Patton said.
The defence of Saipov had previously called on the complainants not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative Member of Parliament says that NIGEL FARGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today a 'more popular movement' during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of Ukip said that the policy must 'feel the heat' of the Eurosceptic, while one of his own parliament members, Theresa May, proposed that he be guided by negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants at the March in Birmingham that the VK 'would be out of it' as Mr Farage Brexit-Minister.
However, the challenge posed by May in the pursuit of the strong dividends is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister calls for her Chequers compromise to be put on hold while it is being attacked by Brexitiers, Remainers and the EU.
Contestants were satisfied that they would continue and try to close a deal with Brussels despite the opposition, and so Eurosceptic and Labor had to choose pressures between her package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to throw 'Checkers in the dustman'.
He suggested that Farage should be restored and that he should be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he did the job, we'd be out now," said Bone.
The member of Parliament for Wellingborough added here: "I will support Brexit, but we must shoot Chequers in the dustman."
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be eligible.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
It would be good to suggest that the public opinion has been changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely unrealistic."
The conservative Brexitier Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the March and told reporters: "I just say: primer, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopulated in the large audience, the opposition is not going to vote, it is unpopulated in our party and in our activists who go from door to door to make sure that we are elected.
Let Chequers fall down and listen."
In a direct message for May, she added: "Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that the policy should be 'sympathetic' if they decided to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political classes," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, 'Let's not get you out of here.'
In a message to the most enthusiastic mass, he added: "I want you to put our political class, which is at the point of being betrayed by Brexit, on the ground.
We will mobilize the peoples of this country who have been concerned with the victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, Remainers marched by Birmingham and closed this March with a two-hour meeting in the city center.
A small group of activists swim with flags where Tories Against Brexit stood, after the establishment of this group in the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Upper House for Labor, made comments on the security problems of a Conservative Party app at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for the wireless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete step.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plants 'good to think' about presidential candidate
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she'll be 'good to think about her candidate for the presidency' after the elections in November.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat told about her future at a meeting in a town hall in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republicans who was co-chaired by Trum campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She's the middle point of speculation that she might go to war with Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
A present asked her if she would be elected to the presidency.
Warren answers that it is time for women to go to Washington to restore our weak government and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest after death of Wade Sims of LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, told us today that a suspect was arrested after the murder of Wade Sims, a basketball player from LSU on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department made the arrest known by Dyteon Simpson, 20, during an ET press conference at 11:00.
They gave them a video free of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man who is seen in the film.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of the Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a shot in his head and died," said police commander Murphy J. Paul to the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde took steps to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and known to be present at the crime scene, in possession of a gun and killed Wade Sims.
Simpson is arrested without further incidents and is detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a young player of 1.98 meters who was raised in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches and started in 10 matches last season. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per fight.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel gave him the victory after team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that a team of Mercedes orders would play a role in the race.
Bottas knew a good start from the pole position and stopped Hamilton almost completely in the cold when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits and left Hamilton in the pressure driving in the direction of the group, something that had to be decided.
The Mercedes went a round later into the pits and came back behind the Vettel, but Hamilton came back to the head after a wheel-up-chool action, which led the Ferrari driver to release on the inside after a double movement in the third tower.
Max Steppen started from the last place and was seven after the first round on his 21st anniversary.
Then he was the leader of the race for a long time, because he stayed at his band selection and moved on fast finish, so that he could catch Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Finally, he went to the 44th round to the pits, where he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so that Raikkonen became fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri did his best all weekend. He was a real gentleman and left me behind.
The team did its best for the places one and two," said Hamilton.
That wasn't a good body steel.
President Donald Trump, Senator Diane Feinstein, during an election meeting on Saturday, said that she was not fully the source of Christine Blasey Ford's favorite letter, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of having been brought to trial.
Speaking at a election meeting in West Virginia, the President had not directly referred to the testimony given by Ford to the Senate's Justice Commission. Instead, he was aware that at the Senate some evening he saw that people could be 'common, dishonest and insecure'."
"There is nothing that can happen and the beautiful display that takes place in the last days of the Senate, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and united and united and unselfish," he said.
"When you look at the news and the jokes and they say 'oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.'
You still know that?
Diane Feinstein, are you lying?
You still know her answer... did you put the document-- 'oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lie.'
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't." He added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July the letter stating the charges at the address of Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein by Ford and this was filed in September, but Feinstein refused to have her office read the material.
"I didn't keep Dr. Fords' charges hidden, I didn't leave her story," said Feinstein to the commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to go with her, and I treated her as she had asked."
But the president refused to believe her rejection, and he made a comment at the meeting on Saturday evening: "I'll tell you something, that wasn't a good body chair.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body chair I've ever seen."
In addition to defending the candidate for the Supreme Court, which is accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power, with all the necessary means.
You see the community, the ignorance, they don't give anything to who they hurt, who they have to run to capture power and get back control" the president would have said in a media report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars v. Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have approved the loss of free day in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return game with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had two goals to lead by scores from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the house close before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard made the same maker for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen with two goals of winning.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for Adam Keefe's men, who had to make a stand on Friday night to then beat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two races met together, where the Giants won the previous three battles.
Dwyer's opening ball came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on an assistant from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assistant with Beauvilleer doubled the lead, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought home the prize back to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the show to Cownie's equivalent maker at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants entered the first rest with a spring when he made his second round of the night at the end of the first period.
The housekeeper repacked himself and Bouchard brought them back to a level equal to a power-play-goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen to lead Dundee for the first time in the fight, leaving him in the second period. He cared for the win with the fifth goal for his team, half in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five battles, play home against Milton Keynes in their next fight on Friday.
An air traffic leader dies while ensuring that hundreds of people can escape the landing in a plane
An air traffic leader in Indonesia is honored as a hero after his death because he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people could safely board.
More than 800 people have been killed and many have been lost after a severe earthquake struck the island of Celebes on Friday; a earthquake caused tsunami.
Powerful nasshocks still weigh the area and many are buried under the bridge in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues had fled for their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild heen-and-weigh traffic routes of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He remained to make sure that flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was finally on the start road, could rise safely.
Then he was kicked out of the traffic towers when he thought they were on strike.
He died in the hospital later.
Johannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News from Australia.
We had a helicopter arranged by Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter came to Palu.
"It breaks your heart when you hear it," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the death toll can rise to the thousands and let the country’s disaster control agency know that access to the cities of Dothria, Sigi and Butung is limited.
"I believe that the death rate continues to rise because many bodies are under the yoke and have not yet reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the editor of the agency.
The waves that reached a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is dry.
The minimarkets are scattered all over the world."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross has developed into a race to help survivors, but we do not know what they will do.
This is already a tragedy, but it can be much worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived on Sunday in Palu and said to the existing soldiers: "I call on all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks necessary for the evacuation.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Earlier this year Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people were killed.
Air Niugini Airport in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline that carried out the flight that was stolen in a Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says that another man is missing after they had mentioned that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a press report that one male passenger is missing on Saturday morning.
The airline said they worked with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the questions for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats assist in the rescue of the other passengers and crew members, after the plane was hit by water during landing on the Chuque Islands airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital today and that the condition of everyone was stable.
What has caused the crash and what is the exact order of events remains uncertain for a long time.
The airlines and the American Marines both say that the aircraft has lost its flag and its landing route.
Some witnesses believe that the plane over the landing route has been shot.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane approached the airport very low.
"That's good news," said Jaynes.
Jaynes told him that he himself and some others were hit by the water, which came to their center, to measure the outputs of the moving plane.
He also said that the stairwells were panicking and screaming and that he had a rather serious headache.
The U.S. Marine reported that the seamen who were close to work on a ship also helped rescue operations by bringing people to the coast with a floating boat before the plane continued to sink about 30 meters deep.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the last twenty years 111 people have been killed in crashs of airlines registered at PNG, but that has nothing to do with Air Niugini.
Analystist sets the time line of the night on which a woman is burned alive
The complainant concluded his request on Friday in the open-ended trial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst of the U.S. Ministry of Justice, gave a few hours of evidence as a witness expert in the field of information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he used the data from mobile phones to determine the movements of the 29-year-old suspect Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers.
Rowlett said he had received the location data from various mobile phones that showed Tellis at Chambers on the night of her death, which was in line with his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police again talked to Sanford.
Sanford was in the witness station today and told him that he wasn't in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked whether Tellis spoke the truth when he told him that he was in his truck at Sanford that night, Sanford said he was 'good 'cause my truck was in Nashville'.
Another inconsistencies was that Tellis had told him he knew Chambers about two weeks after her death.
The mobile phone data showed that they knew each other in just one week.
Rowlett said that Tellis knew some time after the death of Chambers the emails, calls and contact details of his phone.
"He knew her out of his life," said Hale.
The defence begins on Sunday with the closing arguments.
The judge said that he expected the jury to start that day with the suggestions.
The High Broad: What is 'conscious hipop'?
A hypophoptrio wants the negative image of the genre to be discussed by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol points out that the hipop has been disturbed by the origin of political opinions and the accumulation of social problems.
They want to return to the root and 'conscious hipop' again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently had a experience in Great Britain by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York-born woman makes a couple for the judge because of a 'racist' text
A young woman in New York gives the judge a divorce for discriminatory reasons, after she received a false text in which the mother was complaining about 'weather' as black.
The couple refuse to be racist and call the case 'afpression'.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her disappointment when she discovered that the new girl, Giselle Maurice, had become a negroid woman when she met her first day of work in 2016.
'NEEEE WE'VE BEEN'N ZWARTE', Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it twice to Mrs Maurice.
According to the New York Post, when she realized her blindness, she said that her former wife, who was an Afro-American, had given up a bad job and that she was expecting a Filipino woman.
Mrs Maurice was paid for a workday and was then sent home with a taxi.
Now Maurice does the right to receive a compensation of $350,-- every day for the six months for which she was hired to stay home with the family, whether without a contract.
'I want them to feel that you just don't do it,' Maurice said last Friday in the New York Post, adding: 'I know it's discrimination.'
The couple objected to the claim that they were racist by saying that it was reasonable to expel Maurice after they had, by offending her, feared that they could no longer trust her.
My wife sent her a message she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists, married Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
'But would you leave your children to someone who had hurt you, even though it was an accident?
Your newborn baby?
Get out of here.'
As for the case of justice compared to 'depression', Plasco said his wife was expecting a baby over two months and was 'in a very difficult situation'.
You're going to follow someone like that?
That's not so sympathetic, the investment bank added.
While the case is still under way, the public opinion is quick to share it with the couple on social media, where it is prepared for their conduct and justification.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the public would not have much interest in a talking beer, suddenly discovered a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the approval of the book, said about the letter: 'It's hard to get in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time, even for the first publication.
With what we now know about the great success of Paddington, it's very easy.'
She told her father that her father, who had been inspired to write the book on a small toysboard, when a cameraman worked at the British BBC messenger, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book 'biterzoet' was after his death.
About Paddington, who describes her as a 'a very prominent member of the family', she told her father that her father was secretly proud of the ultimate success.
She said, "He was a quiet, well-known man."
'But since Paddington was so alive for him, it almost looked like a child's performance; you're proud when you did nothing for yourself.
I think he's been so successful in Paddington.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imaginations, he used the beer himself for success.'
My daughter was dying, and I had to tell her by phone.
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was taken to the hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life.
'Nothing had called several times to say that it was very bad and that it was expected that they wouldn't get it,' said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
'Then Nad's phone came to say that she would die within two minutes and that I had to leave her.
And I did.
I said, 'Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be back soon.
Then I'll be with you again.
The medications that the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumped, slowly worked out and lost her body.
She had been dead for some time before, and this process went on.
I could just stay there knowing what was going on.
I couldn't mourn, cry or cry, because I was between all sorts of people and families.
I had to be really big.'
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who was now crying about the death of her daughter, was on the plane with the other passengers who had no idea what trials she had to face.
'No one knew it,' she said.
'I went down with my head, and the tears just came.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.'
Roofing women place messages on use to prevent suicide
Two women who have been killed by suicide make themselves strong to keep others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call in need for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis her son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he was first depressed and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
'I don't want any parent to feel like I feel like every day,' she said.
Mrs Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney in Gloucestershire, England, tells us that her son was a promising chef with an impressive gray.
'He was famous for his smile.
It was always said that his smile lighted every room.'
Yet he stopped working for his death because he was deep in the hole.'
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found him after he married him.
Mrs Davis said, "I keep making sure there's a chain reaction."
Mrs Davis made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others where you can go and where you can talk to, though it's just a friend.
Don't be shy - talk about it.'
Mrs Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt somber or depressed or something," she said.
'A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was totally on the ground on the first Christmas day - when the children picked up their gifts, he didn't look at them completely or like them.'
She said that her death was a big trauma for her, but that she had to process it: 'It's breaking the whole family apart.
It's driving us out.
But we all have to keep fighting.'

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain while FBI research begins
'I thought that if we could actually get what he asked for; a limited research in time and scope, we might again create more unity,' so Mr. Flake left last Saturday, to which he added, he was afraid that the committee 'from each other' would fall, in the middle of a strong-strengthened adjustment within the party.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
She's back-up. She's got everything to do with timing.
The interim elections have been held for five weeks, on 6 November, and if the Republicans are expected to do the wrong, their efforts to get their husband to the highest court in the country will be extremely difficult.
George W. Bush has already called on members of the United States Senate to congratulate Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and thus his wife, Ashley, who was his personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI completes the report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, where 51 republics and 49 Democrats are currently in sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would offer Mike Pence, Vice-President, the opportunity to vote in order to confirm the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Number of supersedes in North Korea 'under Kim'
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean passengers has fallen to South Korea since Kim Young and seven years ago came to power.
Park Byeong-sug, quoted from data from the South Korean Ministry of Eenwording, states that there were 1.127 survivors last year, compared with 2.706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for human rights abusers are the most important factors for delinquency.
Pyongyang has not responded in public.
The vast majority of North Korean passengers are finally offered the South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and where you can easily cross the border than in the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ; Demilitarized Zone) between the two Koreas.
China considers the rebels more illegal than refugees and often resorts to violence.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still in the state of war, have been significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries had a meeting in Pyongyang, which was discussed in particular on the ongoing negotiations on denuclearisation.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Young-un, in Singapore in June, in which they agreed in large lines to work towards the nuclear depletion of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of failing to progress in the adoption of American sanctions.
'Without faith in the conduct of the U.S., confidence in our national security is also lacking, and under these circumstances there is no speech of a first step of unilateral disarmament', so Mr Ri during a talk to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterisch', and finds him incapable of serving in the Supreme Court
President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, appointed candidate judge for the U.S. Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterisch', and finds him incapable of serving in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview on Saturday during the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
'I couldn't help thinking that if a woman would behave that way, but she would call her 'hysterisch', Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaughs witness to the Senate Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh rejected the charges that he would have abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were two teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited; he was almost there, especially from the area when he told about his family and his secondary school time.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats in the Commission, in which he called the charges against him 'great and coordinated character murder', organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi stated that she found that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not qualified to serve the Supreme Court because he was fully condemned against the Democrats.
'I think he is disqualifying himself with his statements and by the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats', so Pelosi.
Pelosi protested when she was asked if they would try to introduce an impasse procedure against Kavanaugh if he was appointed, and the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Deputies.
'That's what I can say; if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress, or against the FBI, then he's not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he is now serving,' said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District of Columbia Court (usually short D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that she was concerned as a democracy that Kavanaugh would speak against the 'Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade' (the Health Care Act). Kavanaugh is always known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh raised questions about the revision of certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the confirmation hearings.
'Don't expect us to be laughing if there is now a hysterical, privileged person in the Supreme Court', so Pelosi.
Women just have to be given here.
It is a fair tirade of months and years of angry anger that passes, and they can only cry to get it out.
'We're going to cry if we get angry,' said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She continued: 'I have been greatly helped by a woman who was somewhat leading and who told me that she also cried when she was upset. She developed a method, where she was still angry.
I'm angry.'
And then she just kept crying.
I just thought it was brilliant.'
Trains are partly authorised as an expression of anger, because complaints are largely misunderstood.
One of my best memories of a previous job, in a man-dominated office, was when I had to cry awfully because I was angry. An older woman, a boy company leader who was a little scared of everybody, grabbed me into my backyard and locked me in a trap house.
'Don't let her see that you're crying,' she said to me.
'They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're glad they got you in the box.
Patricia Schroeder, a member of the Congress in Colorado for Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart for his presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was involved in an external affair on board a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally 'cattenwood' or 'open areas') and withdrew from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs. Schroeder said that there was no reason why she would not make a candidate herself.
"It wasn't a fair decision," she told me 30 years later laughing.
'There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone had it about 'Sneew White and the seven doors'.'
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was behind fund-raising, so she promised not to do it properly if she couldn't earn $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give $1,000 to men, wanted to give her only $250.
'Maybe they think I'll get a short break?' she asked herself.
When she held her speech in which she announced that she would not start any formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings - of gratitude for the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to raise money, and to reach voters instead of paying off, and of anger about sexism - that she was in shock.
'I'll have thought I've got a nervous breakdown,' recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how the media reacted to her.
'They'll have thought Klenex was my company sponsor.
I still remember thinking what would put them on my gravestones?
"What's the cry?"
How the trade war between the US and China can be welcomed for Beijing
The openings of the trade war between the US and China were overwhelming, and although the war had not been fought long ago, a gap between the two countries, according to experts, would be favourable for Beijing.
Earlier this year, Donald Trump, the President of the United States, gave the first warning by raising taxes on important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant scale was announced this week when new effective, increased tax rates were undiscovered for 200 billion dollars (EUR 150 billion) of goods; half of all goods coming from China to the US.
Beijing has every time taken in natural repressions, most recently by raising prices from 5 to 10% for $60 billion to US goods.
China has told the U.S. to match every time, and the world's world on one of the largest economies is probably not going to break with the eyes quickly.
In order to allow Washington to rent, it is necessary to request permission, but public bids for the US is too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that, as Beijing plays the slum, trade war with the US, China could be able to support in a longer term, as the mutual dependence of the two economies declines.
'The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions, which could rightly lead to economic fall, is actually much more dangerous than observers have recognized before', so Abigail Grace, a researcher at the 'Center for a New American Security', an idea specialized in national security issues, which is directed at Asia.
Syria 'clear' to let refugees return, so Foreign Minister
Syria says to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed by a war for more than seven years.
During his talk to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, said that the situation in his country improved.
"The situation is now more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he says.
The government will be able to rehabilitate areas that have been destroyed by terrorists and to normalize the situation on the ground.
All the circumstances now exist for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threaten their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war started in 2011.
It is estimated that there are still about six million people in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would help restore the lost country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept any conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had subsidised the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team will defeat the '2018 Ryder Cup' by the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' in southern Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and the Ryder Cup has not won in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the Danish carrier team, Thomas Bjorn, won the required number of 14.5 points to be defeated by the U.S.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who was almost the entire tournament, left his long shot from the tea in the water at par 3, Hole 16, and suffered his loss from Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, jumped in all his rounds and became one of the four players who had ever won 5-0-0 since the tournament in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was shot out by the lowest scorer of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The highest ranked player on the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, loses 2 holes down and 1 hole to play from Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who may be the last fight in the Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Segrio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cups, was the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
'I'm not crying so fast, but today I can't do anything.
It's been a hard year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we're back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He gives the flag by handing it to his native John Ram, who the American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
'The huge pride I feel because I've reported Tiger Woods. I've always followed that guy when I grew up,' so the 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four battles in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A foreign statistics from one of the biggest players ever; winner of 14 major champions, only two behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled the weekend to find the bicycles, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played all the tournaments at high level.
The American carrier, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing performance of his crew: 'I am proud of these boys, they have fought.
In a short time this morning, we have made Europe even more difficult.
We're under attack.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great performer.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their leader.
You need to take your hat off for the opponent.
We're overplayed.'
Red glass update: Concentrations taken from the provinces Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota

According to the Commission, there is a fragmentary increase in the Red cloud in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which could indicate a decline in concentrations.
The Red glow extends from an average 200 km coastal line, from northern Pinellas to the southern Lee accounts.
There are about 16 km to the coast of Hillsborough County, but in less places than last week.
There's also Rode glad to see you in Pasco County.
There are medium-sized concentrations reported for the Pinellas County coast last week, low to high concentrations for the Hillsborough County coast, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations at or for the Sarasota County coast, background to high concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations at or for the Lee County coast, and low concentrations in Collier County.
